PMID:11787563	Lopasić A	Coll Antropol. 25(1):363-70	2001	Mediterranean islands: a concept. 	"This article represents some of the results of my fieldwork and research on the islands of Sardinia, Corsica, Malta, Sicily, Crete and Susak between the years 1962-1986. My main field-work in Sardinia was supported by the Social Science Research Council, London and the University of Reading/Berks, and the ones in Corsica, Malta and Sardinia by the Department of Ethnology, University of Cologne (Institut für Völkerkunde, Universität Köln) forming a part of a project on the Mediterranean of which I was in charge. The above research was also related to my M.A. Course on ""Mediterranean Peasant Societies and Social Structures"" taught at the Graduate School of European and International Studies, University of Reading between 1978-1994. The main purpose of the article is to demonstrate the role of the islands in the Mediterranean, especially their ability in preserving their identity in spite of many incursions from outside. Islands became symbolized by their systems of values, and the ability to survive any attempt of conquest or change. In this the islands received a great help in the environment which helped these islands to remain unique and isolated until the present day."

Pompia is an ancient name of a small community in Messara valley, which is the main agricultural area, in central Crete. The constructed wetland in Pompia is a free water surface (FWS) system, for treating the wastewater of the local community of 1,200 p.e. That wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is a pilot plant but it is simple, safe, innovative, and environmentally friendly. The WWTP was funded by the Region of Crete. The Eastern Crete Development Organization was responsible for the design, supervision, management, and initial operation. The project was completed in August 1999, and has been under operation since then. The effluent is considered to be equivalent to tertiary treated municipal wastewater, and it will be used to irrigate olive orchards. The general sense for a visitor is that the FWS system operates like a natural marsh and a habitat of birds and wild animals. In addition, very high removal rates for BOD5, COD, TSS, TKN, TP, TC, and FC have been obtained.

A mathematical model is proposed to simulate brackish karstic springs. Rainfall data constitutes model input information while output information is the discharge and the chloride concentration of the water versus time. The model was constructed by considering the mass and mechanical energy balance on the hydrodynamic analog, which includes three reservoirs outflowing in a tube that lies adjacent to the spring. Two reservoirs emulate the karstic system, and the third one emulates the sea. The discharge of the spring is given by the sum of the discharge of the reservoirs, and the chloride concentration by the solution of the mixing problem between the fresh and the salty water, which exists in the tube leading to the spring. The model is applied to the spring of Almiros at Heraklion, Crete, Greece. The agreement between model values and field measurements is very good for depletion periods and satisfactory for recharge periods.

A free water surface wetland treating domestic wastewater for the village of Pompia in Southern Crete was constructed in early 1999 and became operational on September 1st of the same year. The total surface area of the wetland was 5700m2, designed for 1200 people equivalent. Arundo donax (giant reed) was used for the vegetation of the bed. Approximately 4-6 plants were introduced per square meter. Two years later the wetland was well covered with plants. The Arundo donax was developed as the dominant specie covering more than 95% of the wetland's surface, reaching its maximum developing potential in both density (70-90 plants per m2) and size (5-7 m). More than 30 other plants were identified most of them in the banks of the wetland.

"The chemical composition of the essential oils obtained from the species restricted to Greece and the eastern Mediterranean region, Satureja spinosa L. and Thymus longicaulis L.; species endemic to central and south Greece, Satureja parnassica ssp. parnassica Heldr. and Sart ex Boiss.; species endemic to the island of Crete, Origanum dictamnus L.; and species widely distributed in the Mediterranean region, Satureja thymbra L. and Origanum vulgare L. subsp. hirtum, were determined by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The in vitro antibacterial activities of the essential oils were evaluated against a panel of five foodborne bacteria (Escherichia coli 0157:H7 NCTC 12900, Salmonella enteritidis PT4, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Listeria monocytogenes ScottA, and Bacillus cereus FSS 134). The analytical data indicated that various monoterpene hydrocarbons and phenolic monoterpenes constitute the major components of the oils, but their concentrations varied greatly among the oils examined. The antibacterial assay results showed that 5 muL doses of the essential oils extracted from the endemic Satureja species in Greece possess remarkable bactericidal properties, which are clearly superior as compared to those of Origanum and Thymus species essential oils. Therefore, they represent an inexpensive source of natural mixtures of antibacterial compounds that exhibit potentials for use in food systems to prevent the growth of foodborne bacteria and extend the shelf life of the processed food."

Numerous bioactive chemical compounds of plant origin may influence the angiogenic activity of various cell types and may thus affect the formation of blood vessels. Here we present the angiogenic effects of extracts of edible plants collected in Crete, Southern Italy and Southern Spain. Extracts have been applied to cultured human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human keratinocytes (HaCaT). About half out of 96 extracts exerted an inhibitory effect on HMEC-1 proliferation. Additionally, we have noted the inhibitory effects of extracts on HUVEC differentiation on a Matrigel layer. None of the extracts showed a stimulatory activity. The extract of Thymus piperella exerted moderate inhibitory effect on cobalt-chloride induced VEGF synthesis, however, CoCl(2)-induced activation of hypoxia responsive element of VEGF promoter was significantly attenuated only by extract of Origanum heracleoticum. Our study indicates that extracts of local food plants, of potential value as nutraceuticals, contain chemical compounds which may inhibit angiogenesis. Demonstration of their real influence on human health requires, however, extensive animal studies and controlled clinical investigations.

Wall lizards of the genus Podarcis (Sauria, Lacertidae) comprise 17 currently recognized species in southern Europe, where they are the predominant reptile group. The taxonomy of Podarcis is complex and unstable. Based on DNA sequence data the species of Podarcis falls into four main groups that have substantial geographical conherence (western island group, southwestern group, Italian group and Balkan group). The Balkan species are divided in two subgroups: the subgroup of Podarcis taurica (P. taurica, P. milensis, P. gaigeae and perhaps P. melisellensis), and the subgroup of Podarcis erhardii (P. erhardii and P. peloponnesiaca). We addressed the question of phylogenetic relations among the species of the P. taurica subgroup encountered in Greece, as they can be inferred from partial mtDNA (cyt b and 16S) sequences. Our data support the monophyly of P. taurica subgroup and suggest that P. gaigeae, P. milensis and P. melisellensis form a clade, which thereinafter connects to P. taurica. Within the previous clade, P. gaigeae is more closely related to P. milensis than to P. melisellensis. However, the specimens of P. taurica were subdivided in two different groups. The first one includes the specimens from northeastern Greece, and the other group includes the specimens from the rest of continental Greece and Ionian islands. Because the molecular clock of the cyt b and 16 rRNA genes was not rejected in our model test, it is possible to estimate times of speciation events. Based on the splitting of the island of Crete from Peloponnisos [c. 5 million years ago (Ma)], the evolutionary rate for the cyt b is 1.55% per million years (Myr) and for the 16S rRNA is 0.46% per Myr. These results suggest that the evolutionary history of P. taurica in Greece is more complex than a single evolutionary invasion. The data analysed, stress the need for a reconsideration of the evolutionary history of Greek Podarcis species and help overcome difficulties that classical taxonomy has encountered at both the species level.

"The bacterial community composition of marine surface sediments originating from various regions of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (12 sampling sites) was compared by parallel use of three fingerprinting methods: analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragment heterogeneity by denaturing gradient electrophoresis (DGGE), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and analysis of phospholipid-linked fatty acid composition (PLFA). Sampling sites were located at variable depths (30-2860 m; water column depth above the sediments) and the sediments differed greatly also in their degree of petroleum contamination (0.4-18 microg g(-1)), organic carbon (0.38-1.5%), and chlorophyll a content (0.01-7.7 microg g(-1)). Despite a high degree of correlation between the three different community fingerprint methods, some major differences were observed. DGGE banding patterns showed a significant separation of sediment communities from the northern, more productive waters of the Thermaikos Gulf and the oligotrophic waters of the Cretan, S. Ionian, and Levantine Sea. T-RFLP analysis clearly separated the communities of deep sediments (&gt;1494 m depth) from their shallow (&lt;617 m) counterparts. PLFA analysis grouped a shallow station from the productive waters of the north with the deep oligotrophic sediments from the Ionian and Levantine Sea, with low concentrations of PLFAs, and hence low microbial biomass, as the common denominator. The degree of petroleum contamination was not significantly correlated to the apparent composition of the microbial communities for any of the three methods, whereas organic carbon content and sediment chlorophyll a were important in this regard."

The Mediterranean land snail genus Mastus (Beck, 1837) is highly divergent. Thirty-two Mastus species have been recorded throughout the genus range, and 23 of them are endemic to the islands of the Aegean Sea and mainland Greece. Of these, all 16 Mastus species reported from Crete are endemic to this island. A robust molecular phylogenetic framework based on mitochondrial and nuclear genes (1623 bp) allowed us to explore the temporal diversification pattern of lineages, using molecular clock approaches. Our results showed an initial radiation in the evolutionary history of the Cretan lineage, followed by a subsequent slowdown of lineage splitting rate. Using a dated major vicariant event of the Aegean area, we estimated the absolute time of the radiation event and proposed a biogeographic scenario accounting for the observed pattern. Additionally, we tried to infer the processes that led to the divergence of the Cretan Mastus species, by applying comparative methods in phylogenetically informated context. Overall, our results favoured a nonecological radiation scenario in the Cretan Mastus species due to an allopatric divergence of secondary sexual characters.

"Atmospheric processes governing the fate of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the atmosphere of the Eastern Mediterranean were studied for a two-year period (2000-2001). Atmospheric samples were collected off-shore over the Eastern Mediterranean Sea as well as at a background station in Northeastern Crete, Greece. PAH total concentration varied from 4.1 to 57.2 ng m(-3), with &gt;90% in the gas phase. Gas-to-particle distribution of PAHs was correlated (R2 0.75-0.98, p &lt; 0.001) with their subcooled vapor pressure. Seasonal changes in the total concentration of PAHs were not observed, while the origin of air mass was the dominant factor determining their atmospheric concentration levels. Air masses, originating from central and eastern Europe, were associated with the highest PAH concentrations. Gas-to-particle distribution of sigmaPAHs correlated well (R2 0.75-0.98, p &lt; 0.001) with their subcooled vapor pressure. Tropospheric ozone concentration correlated with the vapor-phase PAH concentration (p &lt; 0.001) but less (p &lt; 0.01) with the particulate PAH concentration. Distribution of volatile PAHs over the Eastern Mediterranean basin was uniform. Conversely, particulate PAH concentrations were higher at sampling sites located close to urban centers. Calculated relative removal rates of PAHs associated with particles were significantly higher than those of volatile members."

A one-year survey was conducted in the greater region of Crete (located at the lower region of the Aegean Sea) for the purpose of identifying waste composition (including chemical and physical characterization), as well as any seasonal variation. The investigation was carried out repeatedly at seven landfills and one transfer station in Crete, in four phases. Each sampling phase corresponded to a season (autumn, winter, spring, summer). ASTM D5231-92(2003) standard method and RCRA Waste Sampling Draft Technical Guidance were used. Hand sorting was used for classifying the collected wastes into the following categories: plastics, paper, metals, aluminium, leather-wood-textiles-rubbers, organic wastes, non-combustibles and miscellaneous. Further analysis included proximate and ultimate analysis of combustible materials. Metals such as lead, cadmium and mercury were also investigated. The results show that there has been a significant decrease of organic wastes during the last decade due to the increase of packaging materials, as a result of a change in consumption patterns. Three main waste categories were determined: organic wastes, paper and plastics, which combined represent 76% of the total waste in Crete. Furthermore, a high fraction of glass and a seasonal variation of aluminium indicate a strong correlation of waste composition with certain human activities, such as tourism. There is also a variation between the municipal solid waste (MSW) composition in the region of Crete (2003-2004) and MSW composition suggested in the National Solid Waste Planning (2000) [National Solid Waste Planning, 2000. Completion and particularization of Common Ministerial Act 113944//1944/1997: National Solid Waste Planning, June 2000]. The results of this survey are to be utilized by the regional solid waste authorities in order to establish an integrated waste treatment site, capable of fulfilling the regional waste management demands.

The study of essential oils obtained from Coridothymus capitatus and Satureja thymbra collected from different natural habitat types of 11 NATURA 2000 sites scattered all over Crete has shown that they are characterized either by a high amount of carvacrol (up to 75.7%) or thymol (up to 65.6%) or by a more or less equal amount of the two phenols. The results of a discriminant analysis with predefined groups the natural habitat types wherefrom the plants were collected have shown that the oils of both species collected from the dry dwarf-shrub formations of the lowland have a high carvacrol content whereas those collected from the more mesic timber or highland formations have a high thymol content. Furthermore, the results of this study introduce the use of natural habitat unit as a tool for the assessment of essential oil variation.

The regional variability of sediment bacterial community composition and diversity was studied by comparative analysis of four large 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clone libraries from sediments in different regions of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (Thermaikos Gulf, Cretan Sea, and South lonian Sea). Amplified rDNA restriction analysis of 664 clones from the libraries indicate that the rDNA richness and evenness was high: for example, a near-1:1 relationship among screened clones and number of unique restriction patterns when up to 190 clones were screened for each library. Phylogenetic analysis of 207 bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from the sediment libraries demonstrated that Gamma-, Delta-, and Alphaproteobacteria, Holophaga/Acidobacteria, Planctomycetales, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia were represented in all four libraries. A few clones also grouped with the Betaproteobacteria, Nitrospirae, Spirochaetales, Chlamydiae, Firmicutes, and candidate division OPl 1. The abundance of sequences affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria was higher in libraries from shallow sediments in the Thermaikos Gulf (30 m) and the Cretan Sea (100 m) compared to the deeper South Ionian station (2790 m). Most sequences in the four sediment libraries clustered with uncultured 16S rDNA phylotypes from marine habitats, and many of the closest matches were clones from hydrocarbon seeps, benzene-mineralizing consortia, sulfate reducers, sulk oxidizers, and ammonia oxidizers. LIBSHUFF statistics of 16S rDNA gene sequences from the four libraries revealed major differences, indicating either a very high richness in the sediment bacterial communities or considerable variability in bacterial community composition among regions, or both.

"The diversity of local Mediterranean food elements is not known in detail, but offers itself to search for new vegetables, salads, fruits and spices which could be used in to enrich diets outside their region of origin. Most amid those interesting local elements are edible wild plants and weeds. Ethnobotanical research has identified ca. 2,300 different plant and fungi taxa, which are gathered and consumed in the Mediterranean. Among these, &gt;1,000 are only consumed in one single zone, therefore are strictly local. The percentage of local gathered food plant (GFP) taxa (present in &lt;5 samples), is higher in the main centers of diversity at the periphery of the Mediterranean (Sahara, Alps, Caucasus, Canary Islands, the Levant). Islands (Sicily, Sardinia, Crete, Cyprus) also show a high proportion. Endemism of GFP taxa only accounts for a limited number of these 'ethnobotanical endemics' (only ca. 350 are endemic/ endangered species). On the other hand, only a few taxa--30 occurring in &gt;20 samples--are consumed in most of the Mediterranean. Most have been analyzed in the Local Food- Nutraceuticals project. The ca. 800 GFP taxa that occur in more than the 5% of localities show a geographical pattern that permits one to recognize seven geographical groups. These groups show relationships with types of Mediterranean diet and could also be related with human genetic polymorphism through long-term co-evolution in a geographical mosaic pattern."

Grasses and weeds contain species that produce abundant pollen grains and have been implicated as causative agents in both asthma and allergic rhinitis. In this study, we present the pollen counts of allergenic grasses and weeds on the island of Crete and show their impact on allergic individuals. Heraklion is located at the center of the north shore of Crete and has been monitored with a Burkard 7-day volumetric spore trap since 1994, to determine the identity, concentration, and seasonal variation of airborne pollen grains. Data from 10 consecutive years were recorded, analyzed, and correlated to the growth of respective plants on this island. The island's vegetation and blossoming periods have been investigated by conducting field trips. In parallel, an atopic population of 576 individuals with a convincing history of allergic respiratory disease-rhinitis and/or asthma-was subjected to skin-prick tests with 50 common allergens. Quantitatively, there was a fair agreement between total pollen counts and positive skin-prick test frequencies for Parietaria (Urticaceae family). For the majority of the grass and weed genera, strongly positive skin test responses were observed frequently, despite rather low pollen counts.

Pollen grains from the plant cover of a given area participate largely in the composition of aeroflora (pollen and molds) of this area. Association of allergic respiratory disorders with concentration of allergenic particles in the atmosphere is well documented, and aerobiologic studies are of great relevance. A 10-year volumetric aerobiologic study was conducted in the city of Heraklion, located in the center of the north-shore of the island of Crete, Greece. Main allergenic families and genera encountered were, in descending order of frequency Oleaceae, Quercus, Platanaceae, Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Populus, Moraceae, and Corylaceae. Concentrations noted for most of these aeroallergens were much lower than those reported from other European regions. In parallel, an atopic population of 576 individuals, exhibiting allergic symptoms mainly of the respiratory tract were subjected to a battery of skin-prick tests. A fair degree of agreement between total pollen counts and positive skin-prick test frequencies for the families of Oleaceae, Platanaceae, and Cupressaceae was noted. On the contrary a poor degree of concordance was noted for the rest of the families and genera.

A novel, Gram-negative, non-motile, non-sporulating, rod-shaped bacterium isolated from a viscous two-phase olive-oil mill waste ('alpeorujo') is described. The strain, designated AW-6T, is an obligate aerobe, forming irregular, pigmented creamy white colonies. The pH and temperature ranges for growth were pH 5-8 and 5-45 degrees C, with optimal pH and temperature for growth of pH 6-7 and 28-32 degrees C, respectively. Strain AW-6T was chemo-organotrophic and utilized mostly D+ -glucose, protocatechuate and D+ -xylose, followed by L-cysteine, D- -fructose, D+ -galactose, L-histidine, lactose, sorbitol and sucrose. Menaquinone-7 was detected in the respiratory chain of strain AW-6T. The major fatty acids of strain AW-6T were C(16 : 1)omega7c and/or iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH, iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and C(16 : 0). The closest phylogenetic relative of strain AW-6T was clone BIti35 (89.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), while Sphingobacterium thalpophilum DSM 11723T was the closest recognized relative within the Sphingobacteriaceae (88.2 % similarity). Strain AW-6T showed a low level of DNA-DNA relatedness to S. thalpophilum DSM 11723T (33.8-37.0 %). The DNA G+C content of strain AW-6T was 45.6 mol%. Physiological and chemotaxonomic data further confirmed the distinctiveness of strain AW-6T from members of the genera Sphingobacterium and Pedobacter. Thus, strain AW-6T is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus within the family Sphingobacteriaceae, for which the name Olivibacter sitiensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AW-6T =DSM 17696T=CECT 7133T).

Poulakakis and colleagues (Poulakakis et al. 2006: Biol. Lett. 2, 451-454), report the recovery of 'authentic' mammoth DNA from an 800,000-year-old fragment of bone excavated on the island of Crete. In light of results from other ancient DNA studies that indicate how DNA survival is unlikely in samples, which are recovered from warm environments and are relatively old (e.g. more than 100,000 years), these findings come as a great surprise. Here, we show that problems exist with the methodological approaches used in the study. First, the nested PCR technique as reported is nonsensical--one of the second round 'nested' primers falls outside the amplicon of the first round PCR. More worryingly, the binding region of one of the first round primers (Elcytb320R) falls within the short 43 base pair reported mammoth sequence, specifically covering two of the three reportedly diagnostic Elephas polymorphisms. Finally, we demonstrate using a simple BLAST search in GenBank that the claimed 'uniquely derived character state' for mammoths is in fact also found within modern elephants.

Pigmy elephants inhabited the islands from the Mediterranean region during the Pleistocene period but became extinct in the course of the Holocene. Despite striking distinctive anatomical characteristics related to insularity, some similarities with the lineage of extant Asian elephants have suggested that pigmy elephants could be most probably seen as members of the genus Elephas. Poulakakis et al (2006) have recently challenged this view by recovering a short mtDNA sequence from an 800 000 year old fossil of the Cretan pigmy elephant (Elephas creticus). According to the authors of this study, a deep taxonomic revision of Cretan dwarf elephants would be needed, as the sequence exhibits clear affinities with woolly mammoth haplotypes. However, we point here many aspects that seriously weaken the strength of the ancient DNA evidence reported.

Longline fisheries, oil spills, and offshore wind farms are some of the major threats increasing seabird mortality at sea, but the impact of these threats on specific populations has been difficult to determine so far. We tested the use of molecular markers, morphometric measures, and stable isotope (delta15N and delta13C) and trace element concentrations in the first primary feather (grown at the end of the breeding period) to assign the geographic origin of Calonectris shearwaters. Overall, we sampled birds from three taxa: 13 Mediterranean Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea diomedea) breeding sites, 10 Atlantic Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis) breeding sites, and one Cape Verde Shearwater (C. edwardsii) breeding site. Assignment rates were investigated at three spatial scales: breeding colony, breeding archipelago, and taxa levels. Genetic analyses based on the mitochondrial control region (198 birds from 21 breeding colonies) correctly assigned 100% of birds to the three main taxa but failed in detecting geographic structuring at lower scales. Discriminant analyses based on trace elements composition achieved the best rate of correct assignment to colony (77.5%). Body measurements or stable isotopes mainly succeeded in assigning individuals among taxa (87.9% and 89.9%, respectively) but failed at the colony level (27.1% and 38.0%, respectively). Combining all three approaches (morphometrics, isotopes, and trace elements on 186 birds from 15 breeding colonies) substantially improved correct classifications (86.0%, 90.7%, and 100% among colonies, archipelagos, and taxa, respectively). Validations using two independent data sets and jackknife cross-validation confirmed the robustness of the combined approach in the colony assignment (62.5%, 58.8%, and 69.8% for each validation test, respectively). A preliminary application of the discriminant model based on stable isotope delta15N and delta13C values and trace elements (219 birds from 17 breeding sites) showed that 41 Cory's Shearwaters caught by western Mediterranean long-liners came mainly from breeding colonies in Menorca (48.8%), Ibiza (14.6%), and Crete (31.7%). Our findings show that combining analyses of trace elements and stable isotopes on feathers can achieve high rates of correct geographic assignment of birds in the marine environment, opening new prospects for the study of seabird mortality at sea.

Nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite markers were used to study population structure and gene flow among seven Cretan populations of the Aegean endemic plant species Brassica cretica (Brassicaceae). Both nuclear and chloroplast markers revealed exceptionally high levels of population differentiation (overall F(ST)=0.628 and 1.000, respectively) and relatively little within-population diversity (overall H(S)=0.211 and 0.000, respectively). Maximum-likelihood estimates of directional migration rates were low among all pairs of populations (average Nm=0.286). There was no evidence that differences in flower colour between populations had any influence on historical levels of gene flow. In addition, a haplotype network showed that all five chloroplast haplotypes found in the sample were closely related. Together, these results suggest that current patterns of diversification in B. cretica are mainly a result of genetic drift during the last half million years. The main conclusions from the present study are consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that plant diversification in the Aegean region is driven by random rather than adaptive differentiation among isolated populations.

The hydrologic and geochemical conditions that prevail in Mediterranean temporary ponds (MTPs), create a unique environment for many rare and endangered species. Mediterranean temporary ponds are habitats of high ecological value, which are vulnerable to imminent climatic changes, as well as to human activities. This article examines the hydrology and the nitrogen and phosphorous geochemical cycles of four MTPs in Crete. Field and laboratory studies provided the necessary information for the development of a conceptual understanding of the hydrologic and biogeochemical processes that affect the fate of nitrogen and phosphorous in these MTPs. Their hydrology was driven by deposition, infiltration, and evaporation. The hydroperiod of the ponds varied between 40 and 160 d. Mineralization and nutrient release capacity experiments illustrated the significant role that MTP sediments played in enhancing the geochemistry of the aqueous phase. Such ecosystem functions (i.e., mineralization, nutrient release) exhibited high variability among MTPs necessitating site-specific studies with immediate implications to management. It is very important to understand the local hydrogeochemical and climatic conditions to ensure appropriate environmental measures for their management and conservation.

"The classical biological control program for exotic saltcedars (various Tamarix species and hybrids) has involved the assessment of different populations of the leaf beetle Diorhabda elongata (Brullé) s.l. that are promising for release in areas of North America that are located south of 37 degrees N latitude. We report here the overwintering survival, phenology, and voltinism of four D. elongata populations (Tunisia, Crete, Uzbekistan, and Turpan) in eastcentral Texas. In addition, we studied their developmental and reproductive biology, which also included the previously released population from Fukang, China. Overwintering survival of the adult beetles of the Crete and Tunisia populations was 90-99 and 75%, respectively. The Uzbekistan and Turpan beetles had &lt;31% overwintering survival. All D. elongata populations began ovipositing in late March. The Turpan beetle may produce three summer generations and ceased oviposition by September. The Crete beetle produced four summer generations plus a partial fifth generation and ceased ovipositing by mid-October. Both the Tunisia and Uzbekistan beetles produced five summer generations plus an unsuccessful partial sixth generation; oviposition extended into late November. Larval development and survival were generally similar among D. elongata populations. The Turpan and Fukang beetles had a shorter preoviposition period and produced more but smaller egg masses than the other beetle populations. However, this did not alter a female's lifetime fecundity and generally did not affect the innate capacity for increase compared with other populations. The Crete beetle seems to be the most promising for release in central Texas and points further south."

Due to inappropriate agricultural management practices, soil erosion is becoming one of the most dangerous forms of soil degradation in many olive farming areas in the Mediterranean region, leading to significant decrease of soil fertility and yield. In order to prevent further soil degradation, proper measures are necessary to be locally implemented. In this perspective, an increase in the spatial accuracy of remote sensing datasets and advanced image analysis are significant tools necessary and efficient for mapping soil erosion risk on a fine scale. In this study, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was implemented in the spatial domain using GIS, while a very high resolution satellite image, namely a QuickBird image, was used for deriving cover management (C) and support practice (P) factors, in order to map the risk of soil erosion in Kolymvari, a typical olive farming area in the island of Crete, Greece. The results comprised a risk map of soil erosion when P factor was taken uniform (conventional approach) and a risk map when P factor was quantified site-specifically using object-oriented image analysis. The results showed that the QuickBird image was necessary in order to achieve site-specificity of the P factor and therefore to support fine scale mapping of soil erosion risk in an olive cultivation area, such as the one of Kolymvari in Crete. Increasing the accuracy of the QB image classification will further improve the resulted soil erosion mapping.

A new, fast and simple cleanup procedure, based on hollow-fibre liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME) is described here, used for the determination of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in complex pine needle samples. Initially, pine needle samples were sonicated in a 20 mL aqueous solution having a 20% (v:v) acetone content and 5 mL of the sonicated liquid extract was then used for the HF-LPME cleanup step. Different experimental parameters (namely: type of organic solvent used as acceptor phase, effect and type of co-solvent, salt addition, sample agitation and sampling time) were controlled and optimized based on the response of GC-MS instrument under the SIM mode. Under the optimized experimental conditions found the typical chromatograms obtained revealed that despite the very complex matrix of pine needles the HF-LPME cleanup step greatly reduced if not eliminated the presence of interferents, resulting in chromatograms which contained very cleanly separated and readily evaluable PAH peaks. In addition, the proposed method was found to be linear in the concentration 10-2000 ngg(-1) for most target analytes and the limits of detection for a S/N=3 ranged between 0.01 and 0.95 ngg(-1) (dry weight). Furthermore, the repeatability and reproducibility were also found good. Finally, the proposed method was applied for the analysis of real pine needle samples taken for different parts of the island of Crete.

Two free water surface (FWS) and two subsurface flow (SSF) pilot-size wetlands were constructed for the evaluation of their performance in treating highway runoff (HRO) in the heart of the Mediterranean region, the island of Crete, at the southernmost point of Greece. Detailed recordings of the resources involved during the construction allowed a thorough calculation of the cost of the systems and the requirements in materials, man-hours, and equipment. The two identical FWS systems had a surface area of 33 m(2) each, while the two identical SSF covered 32 m(2) each. One FWS and one SSF, named FWS12 and SSF12, respectively, were designed with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 h, with each one capable of treating a maximum HRO of 12.6 m(3)/day. The other couple, named FWS24 and SSF24, respectively, was designed with an HRT of 24 h, with each receiving a maximum HRO of 6.3 m(3)/days. An influent storage tank was required to hold the runoff during the common storm events and control the flow rate (and the hydraulic retention time) into the wetlands. This construction represented 25% of the total construction cost, while 5% was spent on the influent automated (and sun-powered) control and distribution system, from the storage tank to the wetlands. The respective total cost allocated to the two SSF systems (euro 14,676) was approximately 10% higher than that of the FWS (euro 13,596), mainly due to the three different-sized gravel layers used in the SSF substrate compared to the topsoil used in the FWS, which tripled the cost and placement time. The Total Annual Economic Cost (TAEC) was euro 1799/year and euro 1847/year for the FWS and SSF pair, respectively. TAEC was also used to compare the economic efficiency of the systems per cubic meter of HRO treated and kilograms of COD and TSS removed from the wetlands during their first operational year. Based on these estimations, FWS12 recorded the lowest TAEC(COD) and TAEC(TSS) values (euro 89.09/kg and euro 43.69/kg, respectively) compared to the other three systems, presenting a more economically favorable option.

Mistletoes are bird dispersed, hemi-parasitic shrubs infecting a large number of woody host plants. Chloroplast fragment length polymorphisms were used to study genetic differentiation among presumed host races, population genetic structure, and to elucidate the postglacial migration history of mistletoe (Viscum album) across the entire natural distribution range in Europe. The populations sampled belong to four closely related taxa, three of which are widely distributed and differ in their host trees, whereas a fourth taxon is rare and endemic to the Island of Crete. The molecular analysis of chloroplast DNA variation supported the distinction of these four taxa. We further found evidence for phylogeographical structure in each of the three widely distributed host races. Independent of host race, mistletoe haplotypes from Turkey were distinct and distant from those found elsewhere in Europe, suggesting that highly differentiated populations, and possibly new taxa, exist at the range limit of the species. 
PMID:19732434	Kerdelhué C, Zane L, Simonato M, Salvato P, Rousselet J, Roques A, Battisti A	BMC Evol Biol. 9:220	2009	Quaternary history and contemporary patterns in a currently expanding species. 	Quaternary climatic oscillations had dramatic effects on species evolution. In northern latitudes, populations had to survive the coldest periods in refugial areas and recurrently colonized northern regions during interglacials. Such a history usually results in a loss of genetic diversity. Populations that did not experience glaciations, in contrast, probably maintained most of their ancestral genetic diversity. These characteristics dramatically affected the present-day distribution of genetic diversity and may influence the ability of species to cope with the current global changes. We conducted a range-wide study of mitochondrial genetic diversity in the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa/T. wilkinsoni complex, Notodontidae), a forest pest occurring around the Mediterranean Basin and in southern Europe. This species is responding to the current climate change by rapid natural range expansion and can also be accidentally transported by humans. Our aim was to assess if Quaternary climatic oscillations had a different effect across the species' range and to determine if genetic footprints of contemporary processes can be identified in areas of recent introduction. We identified three main clades that were spatially structured. In most of Europe, the genetic diversity pattern was typical for species that experienced marked glaciation cycles. Except in refugia, European populations were characterized by the occurrence of one main haplotype and by a strong reduction in genetic diversity, which is expected in regions that were rapidly re-colonized when climatic conditions improved. In contrast, all other sub-clades around the Mediterranean Basin occurred in limited parts of the range and were strongly structured in space, as is expected in regions in which the impact of glaciations was limited. In such places, genetic diversity was retained in most populations, and almost all haplotypes were endemic. This pattern was extreme on remote Mediterranean islands (Crete, Cyprus, Corsica) where highly differentiated, endemic haplotypes were found. Recent introductions were typified by the existence of closely-related haplotypes in geographically distant populations, which is difficult to detect in most of Europe because of a lack of overall genetic structure. In regions that were not prone to marked glaciations, recent moth introductions/expansions could be detected due to the existence of a strong spatial genetic structure. In contrast, in regions that experienced the most intense Quaternary climatic oscillations, the natural populations are not genetically structured, and contemporary patterns of population expansion remain undetected.

"Owing to its peculiar paleogeographic history, Crete island is one of the most interesting biodiversity hotspots within the Aegean area. We here analyze the lineage diversity of Cretan Reticulitermes termites obtained on mitochondrial genes (COII and 16S) and nuclear Inter-SINE loci. The evolutionary pattern here detected shows a high correlation between clade divergence and geological events of the specific geographical area. The new haplotypes identified in Crete converge with those of specimens collected in northern Turkey, Thrace and Macedonia/Calcydia: this allows to suggest a unique genetic lineage for the Aegean area. A taxonomic and phylogenetic re-analysis of the Reticulitermes genus in Mediterranean Europe agrees with the species rank suggested for Reticulitermes balkanensis and Reticulitermes urbis, as well as for Reticulitermes banyulensis and Reticulitermes grassei from France and the Iberian peninsula. A level of divergence compatible with a specific rank of differentiation is scored also among the three Reticulitermes lucifugus subspecies from Italy and Corse, with the Sardo-Corsican entity basal to the other taxa. In the eastern area, the ""Aegean"" entity, including the Cretan lineages, results the most apical clade while R. urbis, distributed along the East Adriatic shores and Peloponnesus, lays as the most basal one."

Large amounts of solid waste are disposed in landfills and the potential of particulate matter (PM) emissions into the atmosphere is significant. Particulate matter emissions in landfills are the result of resuspension from the disposed waste and other activities such as mechanical recycling and composting, waste unloading and sorting, the process of coating residues and waste transport by trucks. Measurements of ambient levels of inhalable particulate matter (PM(10)) were performed in a landfill site located at Chania (Crete, Greece). Elevated PM(10) concentrations were measured in the landfill site during several landfill operations. It was observed that the meteorological conditions (mainly wind velocity and temperature) influence considerably the PM(10) concentrations. Comparison between the PM(10) concentrations at the landfill and at a PM(10) background site indicates the influence of the landfill activities on local concentrations at the landfill. No correlation was observed between the measurements at the landfill and the background sites. Finally, specific preventing measures are proposed to control the PM concentrations in landfills.

The resin of Cistus creticus subsp. creticus, a plant native to Crete, is rich in labdane-type diterpenes with significant antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The full-length cDNA of a putative diterpene synthase was isolated from a C. creticus trichome cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein is highly similar (59%-70% identical) to type B diterpene synthases from other angiosperm species that catalyze a protonation-initiated cyclization. The affinity-purified recombinant Escherichia coli-expressed protein used geranylgeranyl diphosphate as substrate and catalyzed the formation of copal-8-ol diphosphate. This diterpene synthase, therefore, was named CcCLS (for C. creticus copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase). Copal-8-ol diphosphate is likely to be an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the oxygen-containing labdane-type diterpenes that are abundant in the resin of this plant. RNA gel-blot analysis revealed that CcCLS is preferentially expressed in the trichomes, with higher transcript levels found in glands on young leaves than on fully expanded leaves, while CcCLS transcript levels increased after mechanical wounding. Chemical analyses revealed that labdane-type diterpene production followed a similar pattern, with higher concentrations in trichomes of young leaves and increased accumulation upon wounding.

Origanum dictamnus (Lamiaceae family), an endemic plant of the Greek island of Crete, is widely used as a traditional medicine since antiquity, all over Europe. The aim of the present review is to present comprehensive information of the plant's botanical taxonomy and morphology, as well as of the chemical constituents, biological and pharmacological research on O. dictamnus, which will be presented and critically evaluated. The paper also highlights particularly interesting aspects and common medicinal uses not previously described in the specific ethnobotanical literature. An increasing number of chemical and pharmacological studies have been reported recently, some of which strongly support its traditional medicinal uses against various illnesses such as sore throat, cough and gastric ulcer. A variety of compounds, including flavonoids, lipids and terpenoids (mainly carvacrol and thymol) have been identified from the plant. Current studies have showed that the extracts, the essential oil, as well as their active principles possess several pharmacological properties, like antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-ulcer ones. The recent scientific data and the rich historical evidence of its medicinal uses could support further research as well as its use as a safe herbal medicinal product.

Sediment cores from the deep Balearic basin and the Cretan Sea provide evidence for the accumulation of Cd, Pd and Zn in the top few centimeters of the abyssal Mediterranean sea-bottom. In both cores, 206Pb/207Pb profiles confirm this anthropogenic impact with less radiogenic imprints toward surface sediments. The similarity between excess 210Pb accumulated in the top core and the 210Pb flux suggests that top core metal inventories reasonably reflect long-term atmospheric deposition to the open Mediterranean. Pb inventory in the western core for the past 100 years represents 20-30% of sediment coastal inventories, suggesting that long-term atmospheric deposition determined from coastal areas has to be used cautiously for mass balance calculations in the open Mediterranean. In the deeper section of both cores, Al normalized trace metal profiles suggest diagenetic remobilization of Fe, Mn, Cu and, to a lesser extent, Pb that likely corresponds to sapropel event S1.

"AIM: Our aims were to assess the phylogeographic patterns of genetic diversity in eastern Mediterranean water frogs and to estimate divergence times using different geological scenarios. We related divergence times to past geological events and discuss the relevance of our data for the systematics of eastern Mediterranean water frogs.  LOCATION: The eastern Mediterranean region.  METHODS: Genetic diversity and divergence were calculated using sequences of two protein-coding mitochondrial (mt) genes: ND2 (1038 bp, 119 sequences) and ND3 (340 bp, 612 sequences). Divergence times were estimated in a Bayesian framework under four geological scenarios representing alternative possible geological histories for the eastern Mediterranean. We then compared the different scenarios using Bayes factors and additional geological data.  RESULTS: Extensive genetic diversity in mtDNA divides eastern Mediterranean water frogs into six main haplogroups (MHG). Three MHGs were identified on the Anatolian mainland; the most widespread MHG with the highest diversity is distributed from western Anatolia to the northern shore of the Caspian Sea, including the type locality of Pelophylax ridibundus. The other two Anatolian MHGs are restricted to south-eastern Turkey, occupying localities west and east of the Amanos mountain range. One of the remaining three MHGs is restricted to Cyprus; a second to the Levant; the third was found in the distribution area of European lake frogs (P. ridibundus group), including the Balkans.  MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Based on geological evidence and estimates of genetic divergence we hypothesize that the water frogs of Cyprus have been isolated from the Anatolian mainland populations since the end of the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC), i.e. since c. 5.5-5.3 Ma, while our divergence time estimates indicate that the isolation of Crete from the mainland populations (Peloponnese, Anatolia) most likely pre-dates the MSC. The observed rates of divergence imply a time window of c. 1.6-1.1 million years for diversification of the largest Anatolian MHG; divergence between the two other Anatolian MHGs may have begun about 3.0 Ma, apparently as a result of uplift of the Amanos Mountains. Our mtDNA data suggest that the Anatolian water frogs and frogs from Cyprus represent several undescribed species."

"The insular dwarfism seen in Pleistocene elephants has come to epitomize the island rule; yet our understanding of this phenomenon is hampered by poor taxonomy. For Mediterranean dwarf elephants, where the most extreme cases of insular dwarfism are observed, a key systematic question remains unresolved: are all taxa phyletic dwarfs of a single mainland species Palaeoloxodon antiquus (straight-tusked elephant), or are some referable to Mammuthus (mammoths)? Ancient DNA and geochronological evidence have been used to support a Mammuthus origin for the Cretan 'Palaeoloxodon' creticus, but these studies have been shown to be flawed. On the basis of existing collections and recent field discoveries, we present new, morphological evidence for the taxonomic status of 'P'. creticus, and show that it is indeed a mammoth, most probably derived from Early Pleistocene Mammuthus meridionalis or possibly Late Pliocene Mammuthus rumanus. We also show that Mammuthus creticus is smaller than other known insular dwarf mammoths, and is similar in size to the smallest dwarf Palaeoloxodon species from Sicily and Malta, making it the smallest mammoth species known to have existed. These findings indicate that extreme insular dwarfism has evolved to a similar degree independently in two elephant lineages. "

Taxonomy and phylogeny of termites of the genus Reticulitermes in central and eastern Mediterranean lands are poorly understood, partly due to insufficient sampling. This study aims to contribute to the knowledge of east Mediterranean termites by presenting morphological and molecular data on Reticulitermes from Cyprus. Samples from 15 colonies were collected throughout the island. Qualitative and quantitative morphological characters were analyzed for alate and soldier castes. Partial sequences of the mitochondrial genes COII and 16S were used to evaluate genetic diversity of Cypriot colonies and to determine their phylogenetic relationships with taxa from central and eastern Mediterranean areas. Cypriot alates have some morphological features in common with the Israeli R. clypeatus: an enlarged postclypeus and a wide unpigmented margin of the eye. They are larger than R. clypeatus but smaller than western European species, such as R. banyulensis, R. lucifugus corsicus and R. grassei. For Cypriot soldiers, two size groups were identified, possibly in relation with the age of their mother colonies. Phylogenetic analysis shows that, contrary to what might be expected, the samples with the highest affinity with Cypriot samples are not those from the nearby mainland (south Turkey, Israel), but from north-eastern Greece. Comprehensive sampling in the nearby mainland is lacking, so the possibility that populations exist it that region with an affinity towards Cypriot Reticulitermes sp. cannot be ruled out. Together with samples from the Halkidiki peninsula, north-eastern Greece, northern Turkey and Crete, Cypriot Reticulitermes form a well-supported north-eastern Mediterranean clade.

In this study we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of eastern Mediterranean freshwater planarians of the genus Dugesia, estimated divergence times for the various clades, and correlated their phylogeographic patterns with geological and paleoclimatic events, in order to discover which evolutionary processes have shaped the present-day distribution of these animals. Specimens were collected from freshwater courses and lakes in continental and insular Greece. Genetic divergences and phylogenetic relationships were inferred by using the mitochondrial gene subunit I of cytochrome oxidase (COI) and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1) from 74 newly collected individuals from Greece. Divergence time estimates were obtained under a Bayesian framework, using the COI sequences. Two alternative geological dates for the isolation of Crete from the mainland were tested as calibration points. A clear phylogeographic pattern was present for Dugesia lineages in the Eastern Mediterranean. Morphological data, combined with information on genetic divergences, revealed that eight out of the nine known species were represented in the samples, while additional new, and still undescribed species were detected. Divergence time analyses suggested that Dugesia species became isolated in Crete after the first geological isolation of the island, and that their present distribution in the Eastern Mediterranean has been shaped mainly by vicariant events but also by dispersal. During the Messinian salinity crisis these freshwater planarians apparently were not able to cross the sea barrier between Crete and the mainland, while they probably did disperse between islands in the Aegean Sea. Their dependence on freshwater to survive suggests the presence of contiguous freshwater bodies in those regions. Our results also suggest a major extinction of freshwater planarians on the Peloponnese at the end of the Pliocene, while about 2Mya ago, when the current Mediterranean climate was established, these Peloponnese populations probably began to disperse again. At the end of the Pliocene or during the Pleistocene, mainland populations of Dugesia colonized the western coast, including the Ionian Islands, which were then part of the continent.

A growing body of evidence links poor maternal mental health with negative outcomes on early child development. We examined the effect of antenatal and postnatal maternal mental health on infant neurodevelopment at age 18 months in a population-based mother-child cohort (Rhea Study) in Crete, Greece. Self-reported measures of maternal depression (EPDS), trait anxiety (STAI-Trait) and personality traits (EPQ-R) were assessed in a sample of women during pregnancy and at 8 weeks postpartum (n = 223). An additional sample of 247 mothers also completed the EPDS scale at 8 weeks postpartum (n = 470). Neurodevelopment at 18 months was assessed with the use of Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (3rd edition). Multivariable linear regression models adjusted for confounders revealed that antenatal depressive symptoms (EPDS ≥ 13) were associated with decrease in cognitive development independently of postnatal depression. High trait anxiety and extraversion were associated with decrease and increase, respectively, in social-emotional development. Also, high trait anxiety and neuroticism had a positive effect on infants' expressive communication. Finally, postpartum depressive symptoms (EPDS ≥ 13) were associated with decrease in cognitive and fine motor development independently of antenatal depression. These findings suggest that antenatal and postnatal maternal psychological well-being has important consequences on early child neurodevelopment.

The main goal of present study was the development, optimization and application of different extraction protocols, especially those employing green technologies, in order to obtain from Berberis cretica extracts with high antioxidant capacity. For this purpose, the applied methods: maceration, ASE and SFE coupled with ASE were incorporated. The antioxidant assessment was carried out using DPPH and total phenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu) assays. Major constituents were elucidated using HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-HRMS/MS (hybrid IT-Orbital trap spectrometer) equipped with an ESI probe. The chromatographic and spectral data revealed the presence of several simple phenolic acids, derivatives of both caffeic and benzoic acids, and flavonoids in the produced extracts. It was clearly evidenced that the extraction method and solvents used affected both the activity and the chemical content of the results, significantly. The most beneficial conditions were calculated for methanol and water:ethanol (50:50) extracts derived from the combination of SFE and ASE methodologies. Obtained results classify Cretan barberry as a strong antioxidant agent.

The phylogeographic structure of the land snail Xerocrassa mesostena on Crete inferred from AFLP markers and mitochondrial cox1 sequences can be explained by three mechanisms: gene flow restriction, population expansion and leptokurtic dispersal. Gene flow restriction by geographic barriers caused subdivision of the gene pool into distinct clusters. Population expansion was probably facilitated by deforestation of Crete in the postglacial. Newly available areas were colonized by leptokurtic dispersal, i.e. slow active expansion resulting in isolation by distance within the clusters and occasional long distance dispersal events that resulted in departures from the isolation by distance model. Less than one percent of the AFLP markers show correlations with environmental variables. Random phylogeographic breaks in the distribution of the mitochondrial haplotype groups indicate that single locus markers, especially mitochondrial DNA, might result in a misleading picture of the phylogeographic structure of a species. Restriction of gene flow between metapopulations caused by geographical barriers can interact with sexual selection resulting in the differentiation of these metapopulations into separate species without noticeable ecological differentiation. Evidence for gene flow between parapatrically distributed evolutionary units representing different stages of the speciation process suggests that the ongoing process of fragmentation of the X. mesostena complex might be an example for parapatric speciation. The lack of ecological differentiation between these units confirms theoretical predictions that divergent selection for local adaptation is not required for rapid speciation.

Globally O. longicauda showed good resistance to elevated temperatures compared to other published studies on ophiuroids. The L3 sample displayed a better thermotolerance than L1 samples. Yet, more research is needed to establish whether these differences are due to lineages, geographic origin, or random effects. We provided for the first time individual regeneration trajectories, and showed that regeneration followed a growth curve and was highly influenced by temperature in both lineages. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account the presence of cryptic species when studying the potential effects of global warming."

"In Greece, standard tests are performed in watering and cooling systems of hotels. A total of 1,494 water samples were collected during 2004-2011 from 124 hotels from four regions in Crete (Greece). Samples were tested for the presence of Legionella spp.; 103 isolates were identified and typed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequencing and sequence-based typing (SBT) (in case of L. pneumophila sg 1). Of those, 48 belonged to various serogroups of L. pneumophila (sg 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, and 15), 32 were characterized as L. anisa, 17 as L. taurinensis and there was a single occurrence of L. quinlivanii, L. maceachernii, and L. oakridgensis. In the case of L. pneumophila SG1, one prevalent sequence type was revealed (ST37). The variability of Legionella spp. observed questions the existence of a single ST of the L. pneumophila sg1 species and leads towards the need for a genetic level investigation of all Legionnaires' disease cases."

Extracts from three Origanum species, including Origanum microphyllum, Origanum dictamnus and Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum, native to the island of Crete (southern Greece), were partly fractionated through successive partition with ethyl acetate and n-butanol. All the fractions obtained were profiled with regard to their major polyphenolic constituents, using liquid chromatography-diode array-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the antioxidant potency of each fraction was assessed by estimating the antiradical activity (A(AR)) and the hydroxyl free radical scavenging activity (SA(HFR)). The chromatographic analyses revealed a rich profile mainly for the ethyl acetate fractions, composed principally by flavones, which were accompanied by a limited number of phenylpropanoids, flavanones and dihydroflavonols. The highest values of antioxidant activity were displayed by the ethyl acetate extract of O. dictamnus, which also possessed the richest polyphenolic composition.

A common source of disturbance for coastal aquatic habitats is nutrient enrichment through anthropogenic activities. Although the water column bacterioplankton communities in these environments have been characterized in some cases, changes in α-diversity and/or the abundances of specific taxonomic groups across enriched habitats remain unclear. Here, we investigated the bacterial community changes at three different nutrient-enriched and adjacent undisturbed habitats along the north coast of Crete, Greece: a fish farm, a closed bay within a town with low water renewal rates, and a city port where the level of nutrient enrichment and the trophic status of the habitat were different. Even though changes in α-diversity were different at each site, we observed across the sites a common change pattern accounting for most of the community variation for five of the most abundant bacterial groups: a decrease in the abundance of the Pelagibacteraceae and SAR86 and an increase in the abundance of the Alteromonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Cryomorphaceae in the impacted sites. The abundances of the groups that increased and decreased in the impacted sites were significantly correlated (positively and negatively, respectively) with the total heterotrophic bacterial counts and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and/or dissolved nitrogen and chlorophyll α, indicating that the common change pattern was associated with nutrient enrichment. Our results provide an in situ indication concerning the association of specific bacterioplankton groups with nutrient enrichment. These groups could potentially be used as indicators for nutrient enrichment if the pattern is confirmed over a broader spatial and temporal scale by future studies.

Dactylis glomerata L. is an important forage species in the Mediterranean region, and in other regions with a similar climate. Genetic material from 3 locations in north, central, and south Greece was studied, using morphological traits, SSR, and ISSR molecular markers. Morphological analysis revealed differences among the geographic locations studied for all morphological traits, except the number of reproductive tillers. Moreover, the highest phenotypic variation was observed on the accessions from south, while the lowest was observed on the accessions from the north. Although the results of the molecular marker analysis are indicative, a high level of genetic diversity at the species level was revealed by ISSRs (GST=0.291) and SSRs (FST=0.186). Analysis of molecular variance showed that a high level of genetic diversity existed for ISSRs and SSRs within populations (62 and 83%, respectively), rather than among populations (38 and 17%, respectively). Cluster analysis divided the 3 populations in 2 groups, with the population originating from the island of Crete forming 1 group, while the populations from north Greece (Taxiarchis) and central Greece (Pertouli) were clustered in a 2nd group. In general, the results indicate that SSRs are more informative compared to ISSRs about the genetic variation within a population, whereas the ISSRs were more informative about the genetic diversity among populations However, a similar trend in diversity (genotypic and phenotypic) was observed in the morphological traits and microsatellite-based (SSR/ISSR) markers at the locations studied.

The present work aimed to investigate the genetic structure of 11 edible herbs grown in the wild of eastern Crete that are becoming vulnerable due to habitat destruction and unregulated harvesting. Thirty three populations (268 individuals) of Reichardia picroides, Scolymus hispanicus, Scandix pecten-veneris, Leontodon tuberosus, Cichorium spinosum, Sonchus asper ssp. glaucescens, Urospermum picroides, Prasium majus, Hypochoeris radicata, Centaurea raphanina ssp. raphanina and Anagallis arvensis were collected and identified from nine regions with distinct microclimate (Lassithi prefecture), and their genetic composition was studied by means of RAPD markers. A total of ten primers per population were used to detect genetic diversity and bootstrap analysis was conducted for clustering the samples. High levels of heterogeneity were revealed while the Analysis of Molecular Variance documented that variance was allocated mainly within populations and at a lesser extent among populations. Fst values among regions were moderate to high, suggesting partial population fragmentation. Bayesian structure analysis revealed fine genetic composition and substantial admixture between species present in different regions, although clustering was mainly geographically related. High altitude regions, with little residential and agricultural development (Kefala, Agrilos, Ziros and Tziritis), were the areas where high biodiversity was detected. On the other hand, coastal regions had lower biodiversity, probably due to degradation of their habitat.

Four species of talitrid amphipods (Orchestia montagui Audouin, 1826, Orchestia stephenseni Cecchini, 1928, Orchestia xylino sp. nov. and Talitrus saltator (Montagu, 1808)) are reported from a set of fragmented pocket beaches to the east of Heraklion on the north coast of Crete. Aside from a previous record of O. stephenseni these are the first records of talitrid amphipods from the island of Crete. 2) Along a coastal segment of only 4.36 km, characterised by habitat fragmentation and substrate patchiness, a clear correlation between talitrid species and beach type is indicated. Talitrus saltator occurs only on sandy beaches. Orchestia montagui and O. xylino occur on banquette beaches and O. montagui, O. stephenseni and O. xylino occur on mixed sand/gravel and cobble beaches. 3) The genus Orchestia is redefined and confined to 15 marine supralittoral species from eastern North America, islands in the North-eastern Atlantic, and western-Europe, including the Baltic and the Mediterranean Seas plus a perplexing group in New Zealand. 4) The new genus Cryptorchestia is described, based on nine terrestrial species previously included in the genus Orchestia and occurring in western Europe, the Mediterranean Sea and the Azores and Canary islands in the North-eastern Atlantic. 5) The new species Orchestia xylino sp. nov. is described. 6) An extensive bibliography for the species in this study is provided.

Global urbanization is a major force that causes alteration and loss of natural habitats. Urban ecosystems are strongly affected by humans and there is a gradient of decreasing human influence from city centers to natural habitats. To study ecological changes along this continuum, researchers introduced the urban-rural gradient approach. The responses of centipedes to an urbanization gradient (urban-suburban-rural areas) were studied using pitfall traps in and near the city of Heraklion, in the island of Crete, Greece, from November 2010 to November 2011. Our results do not support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, in which suburban areas located in the transitional zone between urban and rural habitats failed to indicate significant increase in terms of species richness and diversity.

"Recently, there has been growing interest in analysis of the geographical variation between populations of different Phlebotomus spp. and American sand flies by comparing the sequences of various genes. However, little is known about the genetic structure of the genus Sergentomyia França &amp; Parrot. No study has been carried out on Sergentomyia minuta Rondani. Most authors recognize this as a species with a high degree of morphological polymorphism, and some suspect that there are two subspecies: Se. minuta minuta Rondani in Europe, having about 40 horizontal cibarial teeth (sticks aligned along a straight line in the cibarial cavity), and Se. minuta parroti Adler &amp; Theodor in North Africa, having about 70 cibarial teeth. Here we analyzed phylogeographic patterns using cytochrome b (Cytb) and cytochrome C oxidase I mtDNA for 29 populations from 10 countries: Algeria, Cyprus, France (continental and Corsica), Greece (continental and Crete), Malta, Montenegro, Morocco, Portugal (continental and Atlantic Savage Islands), Spain, and Tunisia. We analyzed intra- and interpopulation patterns of genetic diversity. Our results from Bayesian inference showed a complex genetic structure of Se. minuta with four haplogroups including many different haplotypes. One haplogroup includes all the specimens from North Africa. A second haplogroup includes a few specimens from the south of France, Spain, and one from Portugal. The third includes many specimens from southern France, all the specimens from Corsica, one from Spain, and all specimen from Portugal except one. A fourth branch includes specimens from the Balkans, Malta, Crete, Cyprus, and curiously some from the Atlantic Savage Islands; settlement of the latter population remains unexplained. However, our results suggest that the settlement of the Mediterranean basin could have occurred at the same time for Se. minuta and both Phlebotomus perniciosus Newstead and Phlebotomus ariasi Tonnoir. The spatial distribution of haplotypes was congruent with phylogenetic findings."

"Marine sponge-associated actinomycetes are considered as promising sources for the discovery of novel biologically active compounds. In the present study, a total of 64 actinomycetes were isolated from 12 different marine sponge species that had been collected offshore the islands of Milos and Crete, Greece, eastern Mediterranean. The isolates were affiliated to 23 genera representing 8 different suborders based on nearly full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four putatively novel species belonging to genera Geodermatophilus, Microlunatus, Rhodococcus and Actinomycetospora were identified based on a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of &lt; 98.5% to currently described strains. Eight actinomycete isolates showed bioactivities against Trypanosma brucei brucei TC221 with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values &lt;20 μg/mL. Thirty four isolates from the Milos collection and 12 isolates from the Crete collection were subjected to metabolomic analysis using high resolution LC-MS and NMR for dereplication purposes. Two isolates belonging to the genera Streptomyces (SBT348) and Micromonospora (SBT687) were prioritized based on their distinct chemistry profiles as well as their anti-trypanosomal activities. These findings demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of utilizing metabolomics tools to prioritize chemically unique strains from microorganism collections and further highlight sponges as rich source for novel and bioactive actinomycetes."

The genus Phlomis is represented in the island of Crete (Greece, Eastern Mediterranean) by three species Phlomis cretica C. Presl., Phlomis fruticosa L., the island endemic Phlomis lanata Willd. and three hybrids Phlomis x cytherea Rech.f. (P. cretica x P. fruticosa), Phlomis x commixta Rech.f. (P. cretica x P. lanata) and Phlomis x sieberi Vierh. (P. fruticosa x P. lanata). This work describes (a) the profile of hybrids and parental species concerning their volatile compounds, (b) the suitability of ribosomal nuclear (ITS region), chloroplast (trnH-psbA), and AFLP markers to identify hybrids and (c) their competence to characterize the different chemotypes of both hybrids and their parental species. The cluster analysis and PCA constructed from chemical data (volatile oils) suggest that there are three groups of taxa. Group IA includes P. cretica and P. fruticosa, group IB includes P. x cytherea, whereas group II consists of P. x commixta, P. x sieberi and P. lanata. Volatile compounds detected only in the hybrids P. x sieberi and P. x commixta correspond to the 3% of the total compounds, value that is much higher in P. x cytherea (21%). Neighbor-joining, statistical parsimony analysis and the observations drawn from ribotypes spectrum of ITS markers divided Phlomis species in two groups, P. lanata and the complex P. cretica/P. fruticosa. In contrast to the ITS region, the plastid DNA marker follows a geographically related pattern. Neighbor-Net, PCA and Bayesian assignment analysis performed for AFLP markers separated the genotypes into three groups corresponding to populations of P. cretica, P. fruticosa, and P. lanata, respectively, while populations of P. x commixta, P. x cytherea, and P. x sieberi presented admixed ancestry. Most of the P. x cytherea samples were identified as F1 hybrids by Bayesian assignment test, while those of P. x commixta and P. x sieberi were identified as F2 hybrids. Overall, high chemical differentiation is revealed in one of the three hybrids, which is likely related with niche variation. Moreover, molecular markers show potential to identify Phlomis taxa.

"The growth rates of planktonic microbes in the pelagic zone of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea are nutrient limited, but the type of limitation is still uncertain. During this study, we investigated the occurrence of N and P limitation among different groups of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic (pico-, nano-, and micro-) plankton using a microcosm experiment during stratified water column conditions in the Cretan Sea (Eastern Mediterranean). Microcosms were enriched with N and P (either solely or simultaneously), and the PO4 turnover time, prokaryotic heterotrophic activity, primary production, and the abundance of the different microbial components were measured. Flow cytometric and molecular fingerprint analyses showed that different heterotrophic prokaryotic groups were limited by different nutrients; total heterotrophic prokaryotic growth was limited by P, but only when both N and P were added, changes in community structure and cell size were detected. Phytoplankton were N and P co-limited, with autotrophic pico-eukaryotes being the exception as they increased even when only P was added after a 2-day time lag. The populations of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus were highly competitive with each other; Prochlorococcus abundance increased during the first 2 days of P addition but kept increasing only when both N and P were added, whereas Synechococcus exhibited higher pigment content and increased in abundance 3 days after simultaneous N and P additions. Dinoflagellates also showed opportunistic behavior at simultaneous N and P additions, in contrast to diatoms and coccolithophores, which diminished in all incubations. High DNA content viruses, selective grazing, and the exhaustion of N sources probably controlled the populations of diatoms and coccolithophores."

"Members of the genus Scutellonema can cause substantial crop losses to ornamental and cultivated plants directly by feeding ectoparasitically on plant roots (Bridge et al., 2005; Coyne et al., 2006). In May 2015, a soil sample from a house garden from Heraklion city in Crete, Greece, was sent for diagnosis of plant-parasitic nematodes. In this place, there had been cactus (Opuntia sp.) plants (probably imported), which were uprooted 3 to 4 years earlier. After that, the area was cropped with cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) in spring-summer and leaf vegetables such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) in autumn-winter. The soil was collected 1 mon after the end of chicory crop. A population density (ca. 30 individuals/100 cm(3) of soil) of spiral nematodes (Scutellonema sp.) was found by extracting soil with the wet sieving and decanting method (Cobb, 1918). Morphological and molecular analyses of females identified the species as Scutellonema brachyurus (Steiner, 1938) Andrássy, 1958. The morphology of females was characterized by a hemispherical lip region with four to six annuli, morphometric data for 12 females were L, 640 to 760 μm; a, 24.6 to 30.6; b, 5.8 to 7.4; c, 69.1 to 99.3; c´ 0.5 to 0.6; stylet, 24.5 to 27.5 μm with anterior part shorter than posterior; and spermatheca nonfunctional and male absent. The morphology agreed with the description of S. brachyurus (van den Berg et al., 2013). Alignment indicated that the D2-D3 and ITS sequences (KU059494 and KU059495, respectively) showed 99% and 100% to 99% similarity, respectively, to other sequences of S. brachyurus (type A) deposited in GenBank from the United States, Italy, and Korea (JX472037-JX472046, DQ328753, FJ485643; and JX472069, JX472070, JX472071, respectively), differing from one to six nucleotides. Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian inference of these sequences placed the Scutellonema sp. in a highly supported (100%) clade that included all S. brachyurus (type A) sequences deposited in GenBank (van den Berg et al., 2013). All identification methods were consistent with S. brachyurus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. brachyurus for Greece. As the cucumbers and the leaf vegetables cultivated in the area were seed planted, we consider that the nematode originated most probably from the cactus plants which had been previously root ball planted. Scutellonema brachyurus may represent a threat for ornamental and cultivated plants production in Crete, Greece. The nematode has been already reported, mainly in greenhouses of six European countries (CABI and EPPO, 2006). In most of these cases, it is hypothesized that the nematode was introduced by imported plant material."

Understanding the processes that led to the recent evolution of Mediterranean landscapes is a challenging question that can be addressed with paleoecological data. Located in the White Mountains of Crete, Asi Gonia peat bog constitutes an exceptional 2000-years-long sedimentary archive of environmental change. In this study, we document the making of the White Mountains landscape and assess human impact on ecosystem trajectories. The paleoenvironmental reconstruction is based on high-resolution analyses of sediment, pollen, dung fungal spores and charcoal obtained from a 6-m core collected from the bog. Multiproxy analyses and a robust chronological control have shed light on anthropogenic and natural processes that have driven ecological changes, giving rise to the present-day Mediterranean ecosystem. Our results suggest that sediment accumulation began during the transition from the Hellenistic to the Roman period, likely due to watershed management. The evolution of the peat bog as well as vegetation dynamics in the surrounding area were linked to past climate changes but were driven by human activities, among which breeding was of great importance. Charcoal analysis reveals that fire was largely used for the construction and maintenance of sylvo-agropastoral areas. Pollen data allow the identification of three main vegetation assemblages: 1) evergreen oak forest (before ca. 850 AD), 2) heather maquis (ca. 850 to 1870 AD), 3) phrygana/steppe landscape. Rapid changes between phases in vegetation development are associated with tipping-points in ecosystem dynamics resulting from anthropogenic impact. The modern ecosystem did not get established until the 20th century, and it is characterized by biodiversity loss along with a dramatic drying of the peat bog.

"Sea turtles are vulnerable to climate change impacts in both their terrestrial (nesting beach) and oceanic habitats. From 1982 to 2012, air and sea surface temperatures at major high use foraging and nesting regions (n = 5) of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting in Greece have steadily increased. Here, we update the established relationships between sea surface temperature and nesting data from Zakynthos (latitude: 37.7°N), a major nesting beach, while also expanding these analyses to include precipitation and air temperature and additional nesting data from two other key beaches in Greece: Kyparissia Bay (latitude: 37.3°N) and Rethymno, Crete (latitude: 35.4°N). We confirmed that nesting phenology at Zakynthos has continued to be impacted by breeding season temperature; however, temperature has no consistent relationship with nest numbers, which are declining on Zakynthos and Crete but increasing at Kyparissia. Then using statistically downscaled outputs of 14 climate models assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we projected future shifts in nesting for these populations. Based on the climate models, we projected that temperature at the key foraging and breeding sites (Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, Crete, Gulf of Gabès and Zakynthos/Kyparissia Bay; overall latitudinal range: 33.0°-45.8°N) for loggerhead turtles nesting in Greece will rise by 3-5°C by 2100. Our calculations indicate that the projected rise in air and ocean temperature at Zakynthos could cause the nesting season in this major rookery to shift to an earlier date by as much as 50-74 days by 2100. Although an earlier onset of the nesting season may provide minor relief for nest success as temperatures rise, the overall climatic changes to the various important habitats will most likely have an overall negative impact on this population."

Environmental temperatures considerably affect the reptilian ability for thermoregulation and harsh climatic conditions may impose a highly effective body temperature regulation to lizards. Such demanding conditions are more common to extreme mainland habitats (e.g. deserts or mountains). To the contrary, islands have more benign climate conditions thanks to the thermal buffering effect of the surrounding sea. However, this favorable effect may be eliminated in small size islets where the scarcity of thermal shelters and exposure to high winds create challenging conditions. Here we investigate the impact of a tough islet habitat on the thermoregulation of Podarcis levendis, a lacertid lizard endemic to two rocky islets in the north Cretan Sea, Greece. To evaluate the thermoregulatory effectiveness of P. levendis we measured operative and body temperatures in the field and the preferred body temperatures in the lab. Analyses of the thermal data revealed an accurate, precise, and effective thermoregulator, achieving very high thermoregulation values (E =0.91, d<sub>e</sub>¯-d<sub>b</sub>¯ =7.6). This high effectiveness comes to compensate living in an inhospitable habitat as the operative temperatures denote (d<sub>e</sub> =7.79). Our findings, together with the limited published literature, suggested the lack of a general pattern for all insular lizards and indicated a possible deviation for islet habitats.
PMID:27765985	Tzortzakakis EA, Cantalapiedra-Navarrete C, Archidona-Yuste A, Palomares-Rius JE, Castillo P	J Nematol. 48(3):135	2016	First Report of <i>Longidorus kuiperi</i> and <i>Rotylenchus eximius</i> from Coastal Sand Dunes in Crete, Greece. 	"Plant-parasitic nematode species have been reported on several occasions from coastal sand dunes, including <i>Longidorus</i> and <i>Rotylenchus</i> species (Vovlas et al., 2008; De Luca et al., 2009; Mateille et al., 2014). In April 2016, 10 soil samples of 3 to 4 kg from the rhizosphere of <i>Tamarix smyrnensis</i> with different vegetation around (viz. <i>Elymus farctus</i>, <i>Lycium schweinfurthii</i>, <i>Crithmum maritimum</i>, and <i>Arthrocnemum</i> sp.) were collected for diagnosis of plant-parasitic nematodes. The area of sampling was a coastal sand dune near the archeological site of Komos, southwest of Crete, Greece. Low soil populations of a needle and a spiral nematode were detected (3 and 8 individuals/1,000 cm<sup>3</sup> of soil, respectively), which prompted us to undertake a detailed morphological and molecular comparative study with previous reported data. Nematodes were extracted from soil with the wet sieving and decanting method (Cobb, 1918). Morphological and molecular analyses of females identified these species as <i>Longidorus kuiperi</i> Brinkman, Loof and Barbez, 1987, and <i>Rotylenchus eximius</i> Siddiqi, 1964. The morphology of <i>L. kuiperi</i> females (six specimens studied) was characterized by having a slender body; very broad lip region (27 ± 1.5 [25 to 30] μm in width); short, hemispherical tail; body length of (7.1 ± 0.8 [6.5 to 8.5] mm); vulva position at 47% to 55% of body length; odontostyle length of (105 ± 6.5 [90 to 115] μm); males very common (but less frequent than females [45% <i>vs</i> 55%]); tail region with 15 to 20 supplements and bulged terminal cuticle. The morphology of <i>R. eximius</i> females (four specimens studied) was characterized by having a hemispherical lip region clearly set off; with four annuli; body without longitudinal striations; lateral fields areolated in the pharyngeal region only; stylet 36 to 38 μm; and broadly rounded tail. The morphology of the isolated nematodes agreed with previous descriptions of <i>L. kuiperi</i> (Brinkman et al., 1987; De Luca et al., 2009), and <i>R. eximius</i> (Siddiqi, 1964; Castillo and Vovlas, 2005). A single individual was used for DNA extraction. Primers and polymerase chain reaction conditions used in this research were specified in Cantalapiedra et al. (2013) and Archidona-Yuste et al. (2016), and a single amplicon of 800 and 1,100 bp was obtained and sequenced, respectively. D2-D3 (KX398055-KX398056) and ITS sequence alignments (751 and 648 bp, respectively) from <i>L. kuiperi</i> (KX398057) showed 98% to 99% similarity, differing in 4, and from 6 to 12 nucleotides, respectively, to other sequences of <i>L. kuiperi</i> deposited in GenBank from Italy and Spain (AM911623, AM905267-AM905270, respectively), with a query coverage of 99%. Similarly, D2-D3 sequence alignment from <i>R. eximius</i> (KX398058) showed 100% to 99% to another sequence of <i>R. eximius</i> deposited in GenBank from Italy and Spain (EU280794, DQ328741), differing in zero to three nucleotides, respectively, and a query coverage of 81%. Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian Inference placed <i>L. kuiperi</i> in a highly supported (100%) clade that included all <i>L. kuiperi</i> sequences deposited in GenBank (Archidona-Yuste et al., 2016), and <i>R. eximius</i> in a highly supported (100%) clade that included all <i>R. eximius</i> sequences deposited in GenBank (Cantalapiedra-Navarrete et al., 2013). All identification methods were consistent with <i>L. kuiperi</i> and <i>R. eximius</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>L. kuiperi</i> and <i>R. eximius</i> in Greece. Consequently, all these data suggest that coastal sand dunes in Europe constitute environmental conditions optimal for colonization and development of <i>L. kuiperi</i>, as previously reported (De Luca et al., 2009). Similarly, <i>R. eximius</i> has been reported in several Mediterranean countries, including Italy, Morocco, Spain, and Tunisia (Castillo and Vovlas, 2005), and this report extend the geographical distribution of this species."

PMID:28013089	Kourgialas NN, Karatzas GP, Koubouris GC	J Environ Manage. 189:150-159	2017	A GIS policy approach for assessing the effect of fertilizers on the quality of drinking and irrigation water and wellhead protection zones (Crete, Greece). 	Fertilizers have undoubtedly contributed to the significant increase in yields worldwide and therefore to the considerable improvement of quality of life of man and animals. Today, attention is focussed on the risks imposed by agricultural fertilizers. These effects include the dissolution and transport of excess quantities of fertilizer major- and trace-elements to the groundwater that deteriorate the quality of drinking and irrigation water. In this study, a map for the Fertilizer Water Pollution Index (FWPI) was generated for assessing the impact of agricultural fertilizers on drinking and irrigation water quality. The proposed methodology was applied to one of the most intensively cultivated with tree crops area in Crete (Greece) where potential pollutant loads are derived exclusively from agricultural activities and groundwater is the main water source. In this region of 215 km<sup>2</sup>, groundwater sampling data from 235 wells were collected over a 15-year time period and analyzed for the presence of anionic (ΝΟ<sup>-3</sup>, PO<sup>-3</sup><sub>4</sub>) and cationic (K<sup>+1</sup>, Fe<sup>+2</sup>, Mn<sup>+2</sup>, Zn<sup>+2</sup>, Cu<sup>+2</sup>, B<sup>+3</sup>) fertilizer trace elements. These chemicals are the components of the primary fertilizers used in local tree crop production. Eight factors/maps were considered in order to estimate the spatial distribution of groundwater contamination for each fertilizer element. The eight factors combined were used to generate the Fertilizer Water Pollution Index (FWPI) map indicating the areas with drinking/irrigation water pollution due to the high groundwater contamination caused by excessive fertilizer use. Moreover, by taking into consideration the groundwater flow direction and seepage velocity, the pathway through which groundwater supply become polluted can be predicted. The groundwater quality results show that a small part of the study area, about 8 km<sup>2</sup> (3.72%), is polluted or moderately polluted by the excessive use of fertilizers. Considering that in this area drinking water sources (wells) are located, this study highlights an analytic method for delineation wellhead protection zones. All these approaches were incorporated in a useful GIS decision support system that aids decision makers in the difficult task of protection groundwater resources.

The role of environment and the relative significance of endogenous versus exogenous selection in shaping hybrid zones have been crucial issues in the studies of hybridization. Recent advances in ecological niche modeling (ENM) offer new methodological tools, especially in combination with the genotyping of individuals in the hybrid zone. Here, we study the hybrid zone between the widely known spices <i>Origanum onites</i> and <i>Origanum vulgare</i> ssp. <i>hirtum</i> in Crete. We analyze the genetic structure of both parental taxa and their hybrid <i>Origanum </i>×<i> intercendens</i> using AFLP markers on 15 sympatric and 12 allopatric populations and employ ecological niche modeling and niche similarity tests to study their niche patterns. We complement these analyses with seed viability measurements. Our study revealed that the hybridizing taxa <i>O. onites</i> and <i>O. vulgare</i> ssp. <i>hirtum</i> and the resulting genotypic classes showed geographical and environmental niche similarities based on the predictions of ENMs and the subsequent similarity tests. The occurrence of the hybrid zone is not directly dependent on environmental factors which favor the fitness of the hybrid compared to the parental taxa, but rather on aspects such as historical factors and management practices, which may contribute to the localization and maintenance of the contact zone between parental species. Our results suggest that if a minimum required niche differentiation between genotypic classes is not achieved, environmental dependence might not have a prominent role on the outcome of the hybridization.

"A comprehensive survey on aquatic and semiaquatic bugs (Heteroptera: Nepomorpha and Gerromorpha) of three Greek holiday islands, Rhodes, Crete and Corfu, was conducted from 2007 to 2010 at 237 localities. In this paper, hundreds of detailed records for 30 taxa in nine families are given. The occurrences of Rhagovelia infernalis africana Lundblad, 1936 and Velia mariae Tamanini, 1971 are confirmed and recorded for the first time from Europe sensu stricto. Additionally, some notes on morphology, taxonomy and distribution of the European species of Rhagovelia and Velia are also given, Velia mariae is recorded for the first time not only from several Greek islands, but from continental Greece and Bulgaria as well. Gerris asper (Fieber, 1860), a common European species, was also found for the first time in Greece. Furthermore, new occurrence data are given for endemic taxa; Sigara nigrolineata mendax Heiss &amp; Jansson, 1986 and Velia rhadamantha rhadamantha Hoberlandt, 1941 (whose distribution is restricted to Crete and small adjacent islands) are very common throughout Crete, whereas Ilyocoris cimicoides jonicus (Lindberg, 1922) apparently is rare in Corfu."

It is critical for managers to understand how attitudes and demography affect public's preferences for species protection for designing successful conservation projects. 1080 adults in Greece were asked to rate pictures of 12 endangered species on aesthetic and negativistic attitudes, and intention to support their conservation. Factor analysis identified a group of animals for which respondents indicated high levels of support for their conservation (red deer, loggerhead sea turtle, brown bear, common pheasant, European ground squirrel, glossy ibis) and a group of animals for which respondents indicated low levels of support (black vulture, great white shark, fire-bellied toad, western barbastelle, Cretan tube web spider, Milos viper). The species that received the highest support were also rated as the most attractive and safest, excluding the fearsome brown bear. Structural models revealed that aesthetic, moralistic and negativistic attitudes were the stronger predictors of support. Aesthetic and moralistic attitudes were positively, and negativistic attitudes negatively, correlated with support for conservation in both groups. Consumptive users scored lower in aesthetics and were less supportive of protection in the high support group, while nonconsumptive users showed the opposite trend. Respondents residing in urban areas deemed animals of high support more attractive and less fearsome and were more supportive of conservation than rural residents in both groups. Females of higher education viewed animals of low support as fearsome, however they supported their conservation. Our study identified popular species that can be used as flagship species to facilitate the implementation of conservation projects. The results of this study could also be used to design a communication and outreach campaign to raise awareness about the ecosystem value of less attractive species.

We investigate the sensitivity of the relict, endemic Cretan tree species Zelkova abelicea (Lam.) Boiss. (Ulmaceae) to several climate variables (temperature, precipitation and drought). For this purpose, we establish the first centennial tree-ring chronology for the species, and the first ever tree-ring chronology for a broadleaved species on Crete. We demonstrate the strong sensitivity of Z. abelicea towards precipitation and drought in late spring to early summer and the absence of a significant response to abundant precipitation occurring during winter or early spring. Whereas the late spring sensitivity is strong and consistent through time, the species seems to be experiencing a loss of signal towards early summer conditions since the 1970s, interpreted as an earlier cessation of cambial activity due to the increase in summer drought conditions on Crete. However, despite a reduced vegetative period, no significant decrease in radial growth of Z. abelicea was observed in the tree-ring series for the last decades, thus highlighting the capacity of Z. abelicea to withstand changing environmental conditions.

Recent findings encourage the use of halophytes in constructed wetlands for domestic wastewater treatment due to their special physiological characteristics as the ability to accumulate heavy metals and salts in their tissues makes them ideal candidates for constructed wetland vegetation. In this particular study, we investigated the application of halophytic plants in a horizontal flow constructed wetland for domestic wastewater treatment purposes. The pilot plant which was situated in Crete (Greece) was planted with a polyculture of halophytes (Tamarix parviflora, Juncus acutus, Sarcocornia perrenis, and Limoniastrum monopetalum). The system's performance was monitored for a period of 11 months during which it received primary treated wastewater from the local wastewater treatment plant. Results show that halophytes developed successfully in the constructed wetland and achieved organic matter and pathogen removal efficiencies comparable to those reported for reeds in previous works (63% and 1.6 log units, respectively). In addition, boron concentration in the effluent was reduced by 40% in comparison with the influent. Salinity as expressed by electrical conductivity did not change during the treatment, indicating that the accumulation of salts in the leaves is not able to overcome electrical conductivity increasing due to evapotranspiration. The results indicate an improvement in the treatment of domestic wastewater via the use of halophyte-planted CWs.

"The land snail genus Albinaria exhibits an extreme degree of morphological differentiation in Greece, especially in the island of Crete. Twenty-six representatives of 17 nominal species and a suspected hybrid were examined by sequence analysis of a PCR-amplified mitochondrial DNA fragment of the large rRNA subunit gene. Maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining phylogenetic analyses demonstrate a complex pattern of speciation and differentiation and suggest that Albinaria species from Crete belong to at least three distinct monophyletic groups, which, however, are not monophyletic with reference to the genus as a whole. There is considerable variation of genetic distance within and among ""species"" and groups. The revealed phylogenetic relations do not correlate well with current taxonomy, but exhibit biogeographical coherence. Certain small- and large-scale vicariance events can be traced, although dispersal and parapatric speciation may also be present. Our analysis suggests that there was an early and rapid differentiation of Albinaria groups across the whole of the range followed by local speciation events within confined geographical areas."

"The amount of gene flow among local populations partly determines the relative importance of genetic drift and natural selection in the differentiation of such populations. Land snails, because of their limited powers for dispersal, may be particularly likely to show such differentiation. In this study, we directly estimate gene flow in Albinaria corrugata, a sedentary, rock-dwelling gastropod from Crete, by mark-recapture studies. In the same area, 23 samples were taken and studied electrophoretically for six polymorphic enzyme loci. The field studies indicate that the population structure corresponds closely to the stepping-stone model: demes are present on limestone boulders that are a few meters apart, and dispersal takes place mainly between adjacent demes. Average deme size (N) is estimated at 29 breeding individuals and the proportion of migrants per generation at 0.195 (Nm = 5.7). We find no reason to assume long-distance dispersal, apart from dispersal along occasional stretches of suitable habitat. Genetic subdivision of the population, as derived from F<sub>ST</sub> values, corresponds to the direct estimate only at the lowest spatial level (distance between sample sites &lt; 10 m), where values for Nm of 5.4 and 17.6 were obtained. In contrast, at the larger spatial scales, F<sub>ST</sub> values give gene-flow estimates that are incompatible with the expected amount of gene flow at these scales. We explain these discrepancies by arguing that gene flow is in fact extremely limited, making correct estimates of Nm from F<sub>ST</sub> impossible at the larger spatial scales. In view of these low levels of gene flow, it is concluded that both genetic drift and natural selection may play important roles in the genetic differentiation of this species, even at the lowest spatial scales."

A one-dimensional acoustic resonator technique was used to study leaves of the Mediterranean seagrass species Posidonia oceanica collected from Crete and Sicily. The leaf blades were finely divided, mixed with artificial seawater, and degassed to create a suspension of tissue independent of leaf structure and free bubbles or internal voids. The low-frequency (1 to 8 kHz) bulk modulus of the leaf tissue was inferred from the acoustic measurements and independent density measurements. The measured density of the seagrass tissue was 960 ± 20 kg/m<sup>3</sup> which agrees with previously published values. The inferred bulk modulus was 2.1 GPa with 90% confidence limits 1.0-5.0 GPa.

A mesocosm experiment was performed to study benthic-pelagic coupling under a eutrophication gradient. Nine mesocosms were deployed in the facilities of the Hellenic Center for Marine Research in Crete, in the Eastern Mediterranean. The mesocosms were 4m deep, containing 1.5m<sup>3</sup> of coastal water and, at the bottom, they included 85l of undisturbed sediment, collected from a semi-impacted area in the port of Heraklion, Crete. A eutrophication gradient was created by adding nutrients in the water column (Low and High) and the experiment lasted 58days. Water column and sediment environmental variables were measured at regular intervals. The results indicate that sedimentation caused by eutrophication in the water column affected sediment geochemical variables but in most cases a time lag was observed between the trophic status of the water column and the response of the sediment. Additionally, in the High eutrophication treatment, several fluctuations were observed and the system did not recover within the experimental duration, as opposed to the Low treatment which showed fewer fluctuations and signs of recovery.

Knowledge on biodiversity patterns of demersal megafaunal species in the Mediterranean and particularly in its eastern basin is still very scarce. In the present study, fine-scale diversity patterns in relation to depth were analyzed for three major megafaunal groups (fish, cephalopods and crustaceans) in three subareas of the eastern Mediterranean (Crete, Cyclades and Dodecanese islands). The analysis was based on data from the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey conducted during 2005-2014 and the relationship between depth and two different diversity measures (species richness and Shannon-Weaver) was examined using Generalized Additive Modeling (GAM) techniques. Species richness of fish decreased with depth in two of the three subareas (Cyclades, Dodecanese), while the opposite was true for crustaceans in all subareas. Cephalopods had higher species richness at intermediate depths, near the shelf break. Significant differences among subareas were found, with Crete showing a distinct species richness-depth pattern, which was more obvious for fish and cephalopods. The differences among subareas were also highlighted based on the occurrence of alien species of Indo-Pacific origin, which were more frequent in Crete. Our results suggested that the importance of depth-related factors in structuring communities was higher for cephalopods and less important for fish, and that Crete showed a distinct diversity-depth relationship, a fact that can be attributed to its specific geographical and oceanographic characteristics. These results support the current GFCM/FAO's characterization of Crete as a unique geographic subarea. The findings of the study contribute to understanding the causes of underlying diversity patterns and would assist various environmental management actions, particularly those related to the establishment of marine-protected areas.

In a study of 62 plant species of the Cretan flora for their phytotoxic activity, plants were extracted successively with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, MeOH and H<sub>2</sub>O. Phytotoxicity evaluation of the 240 extracts was performed against Lactuca sativa L. and Agrostis stolonifera L.. The MeOH extract of Bellis longifolia was the most phytotoxic. Bioassay-guided fractionation revealed that a fraction consisting mainly of saponins was the most effective. Separation of the saponins was performed using initially a step-gradient Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC). Investigation of the active fraction led to the isolation and structure elucidation of three previously undescribed triterpene saponins, 3-O-β-D-fucopyranosyl polygalacic acid, 28-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-β-D-fucopyranosyl polygalacic acid and 3-O-β-D-fucopyranosyl-2α,3β,23-trihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid, which were present as the main phytotoxic compounds of the methanol extract. Two triterpenes, polygalacic acid and bellisonic acid and four kaempferol glucosides, as well as chlorogenic acid were also isolated. 3-O-β-D-fucopyranosyl polygalacic acid and 3-O-β-D-fucopyranosyl-2α,3β,23-trihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid had phytotoxic activity similar to some commercial herbicides (IC<sub>50</sub> values of ca. 25 μM) against duckweed (Lemna paucicostata).

"	In many Mediterranean islands with limited surface water resources, the growth of agricultural and touristic sectors, which are the main water consumers, highly depends on the sustainable water resources management. This work highlights the crucial role of groundwater footprint (GF) as a tool for the sustainable management of water resources, especially in water scarce islands. The groundwater footprint represents the water budget between inflows and outflows in an aquifer system and is used as an index of the effect of groundwater use in natural resources and environmental flows. The case study presented in this paper is the island of Crete, which consists of 11 main aquifer systems. The data used for estimating the groundwater footprint in each system were groundwater recharges, abstractions through 412 wells, environmental flows (discharges) from 76 springs and 19 streams present in the area of study. The proposed methodology takes into consideration not only the water quantity but also the water quality of the aquifer systems and can be used as an integrated decision making tool for the sustainable management of groundwater resources. This methodology can be applied in any groundwater system. The results serve as a tool for assessing the potential of sustainable use and the optimal distribution of water needs under the current and future climatic conditions, considering both quantitative and qualitative factors. Adaptation measures and water policies that will effectively promote sustainable development are also proposed for the management of the aquifer systems that exhibit a large groundwater footprint.

Plant-parasitic nematodes such as <i>Longidorus euonymus</i> and <i>Helicotylenchus multicintctus</i> are species widely distributed in central Europe as well as in Mediterranean area. In Greece, both species have been previously reported but no morphometrics or molecular data were available for these species. Nematode surveys in the rhizosphere of grapevines in Athens carried out in 2016 and 2017, yielded a <i>Longidorus</i> species identified as <i>Longidorus euonymus</i>. Similarly, a population of <i>Helicotylenchus multicinctus</i> was detected infecting banana roots from an outdoor crop in Tertsa, Crete. For both species, morphometrics and molecular data of Greek populations were provided, resulting in the first integrative identification of both nematode species based on morphometric and molecular markers, confirming the occurrence of these two nematodes in Greece as had been stated in earlier reports.

The Mediterranean Sea is one of the busiest areas worldwide in terms of maritime activity, facing considerable anthropogenic disturbance, such as pollution by hydrocarbons and heavy metals. The present study has evaluated the environmental and benthic biodiversity characteristics of three touristic ports, Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy), Heraklion (Crete, Greece) and El Kantaoui (Tunisia), based on the combined assessment of physical parameters, chemical variables (i.e. nutrients, pigments), sediment pollution and macrobenthic biodiversity. Different port sectors (leisure, fishing, passenger, cargo, shipyard) and different seasons (winter, before touristic period, after touristic period) were compared. Salinity and sediment concentration of copper and antimony were the three environmental parameters most highly correlated with benthic species composition and diversity. Both the environmental variables and the benthic biodiversity patterns were significantly different between the three ports (i.e. different geographical locations). Heraklion port was heavily polluted by AHs in surface and anoxic sediments and had the highest percentage of opportunistic species, while Cagliari had the highest levels of PAHs and UCM and low species richness. El Kantaoui port was less polluted and characterised by a richer biodiversity. The shipyard sector in Heraklion port was significantly different from all other sectors in terms of abiotic and biotic parameters. Physico-chemical and pollution variables recorded during the period after tourism (late summer) were significantly different from the ones recorded in winter. Seasonal differences were not significant between benthic species diversity patterns, but were revealed when the patterns derived from the aggregation of higher taxonomic levels were compared. The present study indicates that a regular-basis monitoring plan including evaluation of environmental health based on benthic biodiversity, can provide a basis for perceiving changes and reveal the degree of anthropogenic disturbance in port environments.

"Disentangling the relative roles of past fragmentation (vicariance), colonization (dispersal) and post-divergence gene flow in the genetic divergence of continental island organisms remains a formidable challenge. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used to (1) gain further insights into the biogeographical processes underlying the Pleistocene diversification of the Aegean Nigella arvensis complex; (2) evaluate the role of potential key factors driving patterns of population genetic variability (mating system, geographical isolation and historical contingencies); and (3) test the robustness of conclusions previously drawn from chloroplast (cp) DNA. Genetic diversity was analysed for 235 AFLP markers from 48 populations (497 individuals) representing 11 taxa of the complex using population genetic methods and Bayesian assignment tests. Most designated taxa are identifiable as genetically distinct units. Both fragmentation and dispersal-driven diversification processes occurred at different geological time scales, from Early to Late Pleistocene, specifically (1) sea barrier-induced vicariant speciation in the Cyclades, the Western Cretan Strait and Ikaria; and (2) bi-regional colonizations of the 'Southern Aegean Island Arc' from the Western vs. Eastern Aegean mainland, followed by allopatric divergences in Crete vs. Rhodos and Karpathos/Kasos. Outcrossing island taxa experienced drift-related demographic processes that are magnified in the two insular selfing species. Population genetic differentiation on the mainland seems largely driven by dispersal limitation, while in the Central Aegean it may still be influenced by historical events (island fragmentation and sporadic long-distance colonization). The biogeographical history of Aegean Nigella is more complex than expected for a strictly allopatric vicariant model of divergence. Nonetheless, the major phylogeographical boundaries of this radiation are largely congruent with the geography and history of islands, with little evidence for ongoing gene exchange between divergent taxa. The present results emphasize the need to investigate further biological and landscape features and contemporary vs. historical processes in driving population divergence and taxon diversification in Aegean plant radiations."

"Hybridization is an important source of variation; it transfers adaptive genetic variation across species boundaries and generates new species. Yet, the limits to viable hybrid genome formation are poorly understood. Here we investigated to what extent hybrid genomes are free to evolve by sequencing the genomes of four island populations of the homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow Passer italiae. We report that a variety of novel and fully functional hybrid genomic combinations are likely to have arisen independently on Crete, Corsica, Sicily and Malta, with differentiation in candidate genes for beak shape and plumage colour. However, certain genomic regions are invariably inherited from the same parent species, limiting variation. These regions are over-represented on the Z chromosome and harbour candidate incompatibility loci, including DNA-repair and mitonuclear genes. These gene classes may contribute to the general reduction of introgression on sex chromosomes. This study demonstrates that hybrid genomes may vary, and identifies new candidate reproductive isolation genes. "

Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in vivo is associated with many chronic disorders such as diabetes, renal failure, aging, and Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to expand the knowledge about the functional properties of Origanum dictamnus L. beverage (Cretan tea) by an investigation about the inhibitory effects on the formation of AGEs and the capacity to trap dicarbonyl compounds. Dittany infusion was characterized for its polyphenolic composition by RP-HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS<sup>n</sup> and twenty compounds were detected. Its antiglycative property was evaluated by in vitro BSA-sugar (glucose, fructose, and ribose) and BSA-methylglyoxal (MGO) assays, tests for the formation of Amadori products and dicarbonyl compounds, and the direct glyoxal (GO) and MGO trapping capacity. The infusion showed the highest inhibitory effect on the formation of dicarbonyl compounds and AGEs (activity values range from 72-100%) and only a weak effect on the formation of Amadori products, indicating that the antiglycative action occurred primarily during the last two phases of the non-enzymatic glycation reaction. These activities are partially correlated with the antioxidant/antiradical activity, as demonstrated by the scavenger capacity against the ABTS cation and DPPH stable radicals, and the reducing power. The registered high anti-AGE capacity could probably be ascribed to the dittany polyphenolic composition particularly rich in flavone derivatives. These findings support further investigations to study the feasibility of dittany as an antiglycative agent in food or cosmetic preparation.

Kotschy's Gecko, Mediodactylus kotschyi, is a small gecko native to southeastern Europe and the Levant. It displays great morphological variation with a large number of morphologically recognized subspecies. However, it has been suggested that it constitutes a species complex of several yet unrecognized species. In this study, we used multilocus sequence data (three mitochondrial and three nuclear gene fragments) to estimate the phylogenetic relationships of 174 specimens from 129 sampling localities, covering a substantial part of the distribution range of the species. Our results revealed high genetic diversity of M. kotschyi populations and contributed to our knowledge about the phylogenetic relationships and the estimation of the divergence times between them. Diversification within M. kotschyi began approximately 15 million years ago (Mya) in the Middle Miocene, whereas the diversification within most of the major clades have been occurred in the last 5 Mya. Species delimitation analysis suggests there exists five species within the complex, and we propose to tentatively recognize the following taxa as full species: M. kotschyi (mainland Balkans, most of Aegean islands, and Italy), M. orientalis (Levant, Cyprus, southern Anatolia, and south-eastern Aegean islands), M. danilewskii (Black Sea region and south-western Anatolia), M. bartoni (Crete), and M. oertzeni (southern Dodecanese Islands). This newly recognized diversity underlines the complex biogeographical history of the Eastern Mediterranean region.

The Mediterranean islands are known as natural laboratories of evolution with a high level of endemic biodiversity. However, most biodiversity assessments have focused mainly on terrestrial and marine fauna, leaving the freshwater animals aside. Crete is one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean Basin, with a long history of isolation from the continental mainland. Gammarid amphipods are often dominant in macrozoobenthic communities in European inland waters. They are widely used in biomonitoring and exotoxicological studies. Herein, we describe <i>Gammarus plaitisi</i> sp. nov., endemic to Cretan streams, based on morphological characters and a set of molecular species delimitation methods using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I and 16S rRNA genes as well as nuclear 28S rDNA, ITS1 and EF1-alpha genes. The divergence of the new species is strongly connected with the geological history of the island supporting its continental origin.

Water scarcity and droughts are a major concern in most Mediterranean countries. Agriculture is a major user of water in the region and releases significant amounts of surface and ground waters, endangering the sustainable use of the available resources. Best Management Practices (BMPs) can mitigate the agriculture impacts on quantity of surface waters in agricultural catchments. However, identification of efficient BMPs strategies is a complex task, because BMPs costs and effectiveness can vary significantly within a basin. In this study, sustainable agricultural practices were studied based on optimal allocation of irrigation water use for dominant irrigated crops in the island of Crete, Greece. A decision support tool that integrates the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model, an economic model, and multi-objective optimization routines, was used to identify and locate optimal irrigation strategies by considering crop water requirements, impact of irrigation changes on crop productivity, management strategies costs, and crop market prices. Three spatial scales (crop type, fields, and administrative regions) were considered to point out different approaches of efficient management. According to the analysis, depending on the spatial scale and complexity of spatial optimization, water irrigation volumes could be reduced by 32%-70% while preserving current agricultural benefit. Specific management strategies also looked at ways to relocate water between administrative regions (4 prefectures in the case of Crete) to optimize crop benefit while reducing global water use. It was estimated that an optimal reallocation of water could reduce irrigation water volumes by 52% (148 Mm<sup>3</sup>/y) at the cost of a 7% (48 M€) loss of agricultural income, but maintaining the current agricultural benefit (626.9 M€). The study showed how the identification of optimal, cost-effective irrigation management strategies can potentially address the water scarcity issue that is becoming crucial for the viability of agriculture in the Mediterranean region.

Debated aspects in speciation research concern the amount of gene flow between incipient species under secondary contact and the modes by which post-zygotic isolation accumulates. Secondary contact zones of allopatric lineages, involving varying levels of divergence, provide natural settings for comparative studies, for which the Aegean (Eastern Mediterranean) geography offers unique scenarios. In Palearctic green toads (Bufo viridis subgroup or Bufotes), Plio-Pleistocene (~ 2.6 Mya) diverged species show a sharp transition without contemporary gene flow, while younger lineages, diverged in the Lower-Pleistocene (~ 1.9 Mya), admix over tens of kilometers. Here, we conducted a fine-scale multilocus phylogeographic analysis of continental and insular green toads from the Aegean, where a third pair of taxa, involving Mid-Pleistocene diverged (~ 1.5 Mya) mitochondrial lineages, earlier tentatively named viridis and variabilis, (co-)occurs. We discovered a new lineage, endemic to Naxos (Central Cyclades), while coastal islands and Crete feature weak genetic differentiation from the continent. In continental Greece, both lineages, viridis and variabilis, form a hybrid swarm, involving massive mitochondrial and nuclear admixture over hundreds of kilometers, without obvious selection against hybrids. The genetic signatures of insular Aegean toads appear governed by bathymetry and Quaternary sea level changes, resulting in long-term isolation (Central Cyclades: Naxos) and recent land-bridges (coastal islands). Conversely, Crete has been isolated since the end of the Messinian salinity crisis (5.3 My) and Cretan populations thus likely result from human-mediated colonization, at least since Antiquity, from Peloponnese and Anatolia. Comparisons of green toad hybrid zones support the idea that post-zygotic hybrid incompatibilities accumulate gradually over the genome. In this radiation, only one million years of divergence separate a scenario of complete reproductive isolation, from a secondary contact resulting in near panmixia.

Hybridization is increasingly recognized as a potent evolutionary force. Although additive genetic variation and novel combinations of parental genes theoretically increase the potential for hybrid species to adapt, few empirical studies have investigated the adaptive potential within a hybrid species. Here, we address whether genomic contingencies, adaptation to climate, or diet best explain divergence in beak morphology using genomically diverged island populations of the homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow Passer italiae from Crete, Corsica, and Sicily. Populations vary significantly in beak morphology both between and within islands of origin. Temperature seasonality best explains population divergence in beak size. Interestingly, beak shape along all significant dimensions of variation was best explained by annual precipitation, genomic composition, and their interaction, suggesting a role for contingencies. Moreover, beak shape similarity to a parent species correlates with proportion of the genome inherited from that species, consistent with the presence of contingencies. In conclusion, adaptation to local conditions and genomic contingencies arising from putatively independent hybridization events jointly explain beak morphology in the Italian sparrow. Hence, hybridization may induce contingencies and restrict evolution in certain directions dependent on the genetic background.

"This paper presents a new integrated GIS modeling method to assess drought vulnerability using multi-criteria analysis. The proposed methodology is an improvement over previous methods since it incorporates both dynamic and static factors that may affect water dynamics and contribute to water scarcity. These factors are: a) precipitation, b) evapotranspiration, c) soil water content, d) soil depth, e) artificial drainage, f) depth to water table, g) runoff accumulation, and h) saltwater intrusion zones. The above factors and their corresponding maps were fuzzified and spatially overlayed in order to obtain the final drought vulnerability map. The map depicts the spatial distribution of drought vulnerability represented by five classes ranging from very low to very high vulnerability. The proposed methodology was applied to the Greek island of Crete located in the Southeast Mediterranean region. The island of Crete is one of the most drought-prone areas in the region, while at the same time the island's economy relies strongly on agriculture and tourism. The derived results show that drought vulnerability is more severe in the eastern part of the island and that the coastal zones of the entire island are drought-prone areas. Also, according to the results, 19% of the island's area is characterized as ""very highly vulnerable to drought"". This percentage varies significantly across the prefectures, with Rethymnon having the lowest vulnerability (2.8%), followed by the prefectures of Chania (6.3%), and Heraklion (17.3%), while the prefecture of Lassithi is the most vulnerable to drought (51.4%). The developed methodology was validated using historical data for drought affected areas in Crete, which is not always addressed in publications. Moreover, in this study, sustainable agricultural practices that ensure water efficiency especially in drought prone areas are proposed. These practices can be adopted by farmers to promote climate resilient agriculture in the Mediterranean region."

"Poecilimon Fischer (Orthoptera, Tettigoniidae) consists of about 130 species and a functional taxonomy of the genus requires arranging species into phylogenetic groups. However, this is a task that requires detailed empirical testing. This paper documents data on Poecilimon species with an inflated pronotum. The Poecilimon (Poecilimon) inflatus group is a lineage ranging along a narrow zone in the south-west corner of Anatolia and in Crete plus some other Aegean islands. By producing data of morphology and calling songs of males and responding songs of females the composition and intra-group diversity of P. inflatus group are studied. Both morphology and male calling and female responding songs, exhibited a considerable intra-group diversity. In the light of data obtained the following nomenclatural changes were made. The genus Parapoecilimon Karabağ, 1975 syn. n. is synonymised with Poecilimon Fischer and Parapoecilimon antalyaensis Karabağ, 1975 is given a new combination, Poecilimon antalyaensis (Karabağ, 1975) comb. n. Four new taxa are described in the group: (i) Poecilimon isopterus sp.n.; (ii) Poecilimon inflatus lyciae subsp. n.; (iii) Poecilimon antalyaensis myrae subsp. n., and (iv) Poecilimon antalyaensis anemurium subsp. n. The Poecilimon (P.) inflatus species group consists of the following species: (i) Poecilimon inflatus Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1891; (ii) Poecilimon martinae Heller, 2004; (iii) Poecilimon cretensis Werner, 1903; (iv) Poecilimon antalyaensis (Karabağ, 1975) comb. n.; (v) Poecilimon bilgeri Karabağ, 1953 and (vi) Poecilimon isopterus sp.n. The species group is defined by a combination of characters including the pronotum inflated in metazona and a male cerci mostly black in their apical 1/2-1/3. The male calling song has typically two types of short syllables and the females respond acoustically with very short latency times. By using combination of morphology and song data we suggest three main lineages in the group: (i) P. bilgeri, (ii) P. antalyaensis and (iii) the other four species."

We report new findings of non-indigenous Indo-Pacific molluscs from shallow water habitats off Israel, Greece and Egypt, eastern Mediterranean Sea. The bivalves <i>Pillucina vietnamica</i> Zorina, 1978 and <i>Alveinus miliaceus</i> (Issel, 1869) were collected from sandy bottoms off Israel, whereas <i>Gregariella</i> cf. <i>ehrenbergi</i> (Issel, 1869) was recovered from a buoy originating from Port Said, Egypt, and stranded on the Israeli coast. The three species are first records for the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, we report range extensions for several gastropods: <i>Varicopeza pauxilla</i> (A. Adams, 1855) is recorded from Israel, <i>Phidiana militaris</i> (Alder and Hancock, 1864) from southern Israel (Ashqelon), and <i>Viriola</i> cf. <i>bayani</i> Jousseaume, 1884 from Israel and Crete. Shells and valves of an unidentified lucinid bivalve morphologically distinct from any known Mediterranean species were found along the Israeli Mediterranean shore.

"Based on adults, mature pupae, and larvae sampled at the same sites on mainland Greece and on the Greek islands of Kerkyra (Corfu) and Crete, the previously unknown larval stages of Rhyacophila tsurakiana Malicky 1984, R. gudrunae Malicky 1972, and R. biegelmeieri Malicky 1984 could be associated and identified. This material enabled us to describe and illustrate the final instar larvae of these three species, and to extract reliable diagnostic characters updating the existing larval key to the Greek species of genus Rhyacophila Stephens 1836 (Karaouzas et.al. 2015). In the context of this key, R. tsurakiana (together with R. tristis Pictet 1834 and R. obtusa Klapálek 1894) lacks abdominal gills; the three species can be separated by the shape of the dorsal sclerite of abdominal segment IX and by anal proleg morphology. Rhyacophila gudrunae is the only Greek species so far where larvae are fitted with one four-filament gill on each body side of the abdomen. Finally, R. biegelmeieri has one tufted multifilament gill on each body side and can be separated from four other species sharing this gill morphology by coloration patterns and head widths; however, separation from R. nubila Zetterstedt 1840 and R. palmeni McLachlan 1879 is not yet possible. Rhyacophila tsurakiana and R. biegelmeieri are large-scale endemic caddisfly species of European Ecoregion 6 (Hellenic Western Balkan), whereas R. gudrunae is a micro-endemic species of this region and restricted to the island of Crete (Malicky 2005b; Graf et al. 2008)."

A bathymetric transect in the north coast of Crete first studied in 1989, was revisited 24 years later. Identical sampling design, season, techniques and protocols were followed in both studies in order to minimize bias in the long-term comparisons. This comprehensive macrofaunal dataset (4 stations, 2 sampling seasons, 7 replicates in each study) revealed changes in benthic diversity and community composition between the sampling periods. The recorded changes were higher at the stations located close to the coastal zone. In addition, while benthic communities showed lower total abundance during the recent sampling period, species abundances were more evenly distributed indicating that some species dominated the historical communities. In spite of these changes, the ecological status remained above the threshold values for good ecological status. The results indicated that changes in the benthic community seem to have been driven by local anthropogenic factors and natural variability rather than by large-scale factors such as nutrients influxes in the entire Mediterranean Basin.

Variability in long-distance migration strategies is still poorly understood due to the fact that individuals are often tracked from a single colony/population. Transoceanic migrations of Scopoli's shearwaters (<i>Calonectris diomedea</i>) across the Strait of Gibraltar (SoG) have been tracked from several breeding colonies isolatedly, and factors related to the variability in phenological schedules among different populations remain, therefore, not well-understood. Using light-level geolocator data, I examined the autumn (postbreeding) and spring (prebreeding) migratory passage dates through SoG of four populations of Scopoli's shearwater spread along the longitudinal breeding range of the species. Additionally, I also estimated the at-sea activity patterns (from immersion data) during both migratory passages, as well as the body size (from morphometric data) of the individuals of these populations. On average, Scopoli's shearwaters leave the Mediterranean (cross SoG) on 31 October ± 1.8 days on their autumn migrations and return on 03 March ± 1.6 days on their spring migrations. At the population level, there was a clear gradient in the timing of crossing SoG: birds from the westernmost populations (Murcia, SE Spain) were the first ones in leaving the Mediterranean while easternmost breeders (Paximada, Crete) were the last ones. In spring, only birds from the largest breeding population (Zembra, Tunisia) seemed to advance their return and crossed SoG significantly earlier than birds tracked at the remaining populations. In both passages, shearwaters from central and eastern populations spent more time flying than their conspecifics from the western Mediterranean. Scopoli's shearwater populations display a differential phenology and behavior in their migratory passages through SoG. The longitudinal gradient in body size already reported for the species could be an evolutionary response to an obvious trade-off between sharing common wintering grounds in the Atlantic Ocean and the temporal constraints of restoring physiological condition in those grounds.

Based on the predictions of General Circulation Models, significant reduction of precipitation in Mediterranean areas is a possible scenario. Hence, better understanding of the spatial and temporal precipitation patterns is necessary in order to quantify desertification risks and design suitable mitigation measures. This study uses monthly precipitation measurements from a sparse network of 54 monitoring stations on the Mediterranean island of Crete (Greece). The study period extends from 1948 to 2012. The data reveal strong correlations between the western and eastern parts of the island. However, the average annual precipitation in the West is about 450 mm higher than that in the East. We construct a spatial model of average annual precipitation in Crete. The model involves a topographic trend and residuals with anisotropic spatial correlations which are fitted with a recently developed variogram function. We use regression kriging to generate annual precipitation maps and to identify locations of high estimation uncertainty. To our knowledge, this is the most detailed spatial analysis of precipitation in Crete to date. We present the analysis in detail for the year 1971. The trend accounts for ≈ 74% of the total variance. The highest precipitation estimate is 2331 mm in the West and 1781 mm in the East. The highest relative estimation uncertainty (≈ 20%) is observed along the southeastern coastline of the island, where the lowest values of annual precipitation are observed. This region includes one of the major agricultural areas of the island. The same overall patterns are found for other years in the study. Finally, we find no statistical evidence for a decrease in the global (over the entire island) annual precipitation during the study period.

"The island of Crete is a biodiversity hotspot having 223 endemic vascular taxa (species and subspecies) as a result of its long isolation and the wide range of habitats it includes. We explore trends and patterns in the electronic trade of these unique genetic resources and in their involvement in wildlife tourism, the ways these two activities are performed and the associated potential threats on the plants' wild populations, and we also identify priority taxa requiring special attention. The main part of the study was conducted in 2016-2017 using English as a search language; an additional search was conducted in 2019 using German and French. We found e-commerce for 28 (13%) endemic taxa. These are traded by 65 nurseries from 14 countries, the UK primarily. Among the traded plants, 16 face extinction risk and/or are under protection status. Prices vary largely for the same taxon and form of sale. Lamiaceae is the family with the highest number of e-traded taxa, <i>Tulipa bakeri</i> is the most traded species, and the living plant is the commonest form of sale. Thirty-seven endemic taxa are advertised in the websites of travel agencies involved in wildlife tourism. <i>Tulipa doerfleri</i> is the most frequently encountered taxon in these websites, whereas Lamiaceae, Liliaceae and Orchidaceae are similarly represented. The additional search showed a very rapid increase in the e-trade of the Cretan endemis. The two examined markets are similar in that geophytes play a prominent role and Lamiaceae rank first among the represented plant families, but differ in several aspects: only 22.6% of the taxa detected are common in both, obedience to rules exhibited by travel agencies is not usually the case with nurseries, and potential threats to wild populations are estimated as considerably higher for the traded plants. Sixteen endemic taxa of Crete were identified as requiring special attention."

Exploring species richness and turnover patterns and their drivers can provide new insights into underlying mechanisms shaping community assembly, with significant implications for biodiversity conservation. Here, we explored diversity patterns of non-endemic, neo-endemic and palaeo-endemic vascular plants in Crete, Greece, a Mediterranean hotspot of plant richness and endemism. We evaluated the relationship between α-diversity and environmental (bioclimatic variables, topography), and anthropogenic variables by Generalized Additive Models, after accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Then, we quantified turnover using the novel concept of zeta diversity (the number of shared species by multiple sites), a framework which allows to explore the full spectrum of compositional turnover, the contribution of rare and widespread species to observed patterns and the underlying processes shaping them. Finally, we explored the abiotic and biotic effects, i.e. how well one category of species (non-endemics, palaeo-endemics, neo-endemics) predicts the patterns of the other categories, on zeta diversity by multi-site Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling. We found a strong correlation between neo-endemic and palaeo-endemic α-diversity, with climate, topography, and human impact driving species richness. Zeta diversity analysis revealed a sharper decrease of shared palaeo-endemic species, followed by neo-endemics, and then by non-endemics with the number of sites considered to estimate compositional turnover. Perhaps, the narrow distributions of palaeo-endemics as relict species and often habitat specialists, thus persisting locally, and of neo-endemics that may have not reached yet their potential geographical range, resulted in the observed zeta diversity decline pattern. Deterministic processes controlled species turnover of rare non-endemic and neo-endemic species, while deterministic and stochastic processes contributed similarly to palaeo-endemic turnover. However, stochasticity dominates in the case of widespread species in all occasions. The environmental and anthropogenic variables were poor predictors of compositional turnover, especially of widespread species. However, the non-endemic species composition was correlated to rare palaeo-endemics and neo-endemics, highlighting the importance of biotic effects in driving turnover patterns. It seems that centers of neo-endemism of vascular plants coincide with centers of palaeo-endemism in Crete, but species richness and species turnover are shaped by different drivers.

The Kastellorizo island group (in the Dodecanese, Greece) is situated in the southeast corner of the Aegean Archipelago. It consists of twenty islets, of which the three largest (Kastellorizo, Ro and Strongyli) and seven smaller ones belong to Greece. Knowledge of the malacofauna on the islands is relatively poor. Only eight species were known prior to the present study, all from the islet of Kastellorizo. Here, using the scientific collections at the Natural History Museum of Crete collected mainly by the authors and also by several researchers since 1976, we reappraise the malacofauna of the island group. Thirty-one species were found in total (23 from Kastellorizo, 19 from Ro, 15 from Strongyli, 10 from Agios Georgios, 14 from Agrielia, 6 from Psomi and 10 from Psoradia). The fact that there are no endemic snail species in the islands can be accounted for by their proximity to the Turkish coast, their common paleogeography with Turkey until the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, and the influence of humans. All but two species, <i>Mastus etuberculatus</i> and <i>Vitrea riedeliana</i>, are known from the adjacent Turkish coasts. Together with the subfossil species found on the smaller islets, the predominance of different species on each islet suggests a continuous substitution from the source areas of Turkey and the Aegean.

"Understanding the distribution of wild medicinal plants and areas that are suitable for cultivation of these plants is important for both conservation and agriculture. Here, we study ten taxa with known ethnopharmacological uses, which have been used extensively in traditional medicine and as culinary supplements. We aim to (1) predict and map the potential habitat suitability for these taxa across the study area, (2) investigate spatial patterns that could have management implications, such as niche similarities among the taxa and suitability ""hotspots"" with the use of novel indices, and (3) develop a platform where parts of this information can be accessed and utilized by all interested groups, from the policy-maker level to the individual practitioner level. Ecological Niche Models developed for each study taxon, based on topographic, bioclimatic, soil, and land use variables had high predictive power and were used as the basis for suitability visualization. A series of informative indices were also calculated and mapped, revealing spatial patterns not readily observable from the single-taxon predictions, and providing valuable information to managers. Finally, a web-based, easy-to-use application was also created, where the predicted suitability scores for the study area can be made accessible to anyone interested. The application can provide information both in a visual form (i.e. maps of predicted suitability) and in a numerical form (i.e. estimated suitability scores for all taxa in a given geographical location). This study provides the scientific tools to make a step towards cultivating a group of economically important wild medicinal plants in Crete, as well as the tools to disseminate this information to decision makers and practitioners, and eventually integrate the research findings in local agricultural practices."

"The grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars in the island of Crete, Greece represent one of the oldest populations of the species; nevertheless, very scarce information is available about its genetic structure. In this study, Vitis cultivars collected from the island of Crete were characterized using microsatellite markers. A broad germplasm collection representing 44 inferred Vitis cultivars, a total of 163 accessions, from the area of Crete including 37 wine and 7 table cultivars were fingerprinted employing thirteen (13) standardized simple sequence repeat (SSR, microsatellite) loci. SSR allelic analysis and a similarity dendrogram construction (cluster analysis) was followed by a hierarchical STRUCTURE analysis. The mean observed (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) were 0.7372 and 0.7686, respectively. The cumulative probability of identity was very low with a value of 3.18 × 10e<sup>-15</sup>. According to the cluster analysis, twenty-nine of the 44 Vitis cultivars were presented in single clusters and five cultivars were presented as distinct single accessions. In addition, ten (10) cases of synonyms and ten (10) groups of homonyms were also identified. STRUCTURE analysis provided evidence for three genetic groups (putative ancestry groups). Hierarchical STRUCTURE analysis revealed further stratification within each of the three ancestry groups. This work provides the molecular fingerprinting of 44 Vitis cultivars and an initial proposal in their ancestry. In the future, molecular genetic information along with morphological (ampelographic) data will provide an intergraded characterization of existing diversity and will allow for its use in breeding efforts and in commercial viticulture."

"The characteristics of desert dust storms (DDS) have been shown to change in response to climate change and land use. There is limited information on the frequency and intensity of DDS over the last decade at a regional scale in the Eastern Mediterranean. An algorithm based on daily ground measurements (PM<sub>10</sub>, particulate matter ≤10 μm), satellite products (dust aerosol optical depth) and meteorological parameters, was used to identify dust intrusions for three Eastern Mediterranean locations (Crete-Greece, Cyprus, and Israel) between 2006 and 2017. Days with 24-hr average PM<sub>10</sub> concentration above ~30 μg/m<sup>3</sup> were found to be a significant indicator of DDS for the background sites of Cyprus and Crete. Higher thresholds were found for Israel depending on the season (fall and spring: PM<sub>10</sub> &gt; 70 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, winter and summer: PM<sub>10</sub> &gt; 90 μg/m<sup>3</sup>). We observed a high variability in the frequency and intensity of DDS during the last decade, characterized by a steady trend with sporadic peaks. The years with the highest DDS frequency were not necessarily the years with the most intense episodes. Specifically, the highest dust frequency was observed in 2010 at all three locations, but the highest annual median dust-PM<sub>10</sub> level was observed in 2012 in Crete (55.8 μg/m<sup>3</sup>) and Israel (137.4 μg/m<sup>3</sup>), and in 2010 in Cyprus (45.3 μg/m<sup>3</sup>). Crete and Cyprus experienced the same most intense event in 2006, with 24 h-PM<sub>10</sub> average of 705.7 μg/m<sup>3</sup> and 1254.6 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, which originated from Sahara desert. The highest 24 h-PM10 average concentration for Israel was observed in 2010 (3210.9 μg/m<sup>3</sup>) during a three-day Saharan dust episode. However, a sub-analysis for Cyprus (years 2000-2017) suggests a change in DDS seasonality pattern, intensity, and desert of origin. For more robust conclusions on DDS trends in relation to climate change, future work needs to study data over several decades from different locations."

Mediterranean islands have complex reptile assemblages, but little is known about the factors that determine their organization. In this study, the structure of assemblages of Squamata was evaluated based on their species richness and two measures of phylogenetic diversity (variability and clustering). I evaluated the composition of the assemblages comparing distinct biogeographic subregions within the Mediterranean: Adriatic, Aegean, Balearic, Corsica-Sardinia, Crete, Gulf of Gabés, Ionian Sea, Ligurian Sea, Malta, Sicily, and Tyrrhenian Sea. The effect of island environments and geographical isolation on the diversity metrics was assessed using generalized linear models. The analyses indicated that species richness was mostly influenced by island area and geographical isolation. Assemblages on smaller islands were poorer in species and phylogenetically dispersed, possibly as an effect of interspecific competition. The species composition of the assemblages was determined by similar environmental drivers within the biogeographic subregions, including island area, island elevation, geographical isolation, and aridity. In several subregions, significant patterns of phylogenetic attraction were found in species co-occurrences, caused by the limits imposed by the island size on large predatory species.

"Hoplopholcus Kulczyński, 1908 is a genus of relatively large pholcid spiders, ranging from eastern Central Europe to Crete, the Levant, and Georgia. Species in this genus are often difficult to distinguish from each other, and the reexamination of previously published material revealed many misidentifications. The present study provides redescriptions of the ten previously described species and descriptions of six new species, all based on males and females: Hoplopholcus suluin sp. n., H. konya sp. n., H. atik sp. n., and H. bursa sp. n. from Turkey, H. gazipasa sp. n. from Turkey and Greece, and H. dim sp. n. from Turkey and Cyprus. The main conclusion is that several species need further investigation, based on focused sampling and ideally including molecular data. Some species seem to include morphologically distinct epigean and hypogean populations; others may eventually need to be split into two or more species. Further undescribed species are most likely to occur in Turkey."

A new species of the costal genus Brachemys Abeille de Perrin, 1890 is described from Crete, B. minotaurus n.sp. (Coleoptera, Malachiidae). The species is included in the subgenus Atelestodes Abeille de Perrin, 1890 due to the lack of modified protarsi, although the subgeneric classification of Brachemys may need to be revised. Specimens of the new species were found running on bare rock in the supralittoral zone, bearing a striking resemblance to ants.

"The planktonic food web in the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea is dominated by small-sized (&lt;20 μm) microbes, with nanoflagellates being the major bacterial grazers and the main participants in nutrient cycling. Phosphate is a key nutrient in the P-limited Cretan Sea (NE Mediterranean) and P-availability can affect its trophic dynamics. Here, we examined the grazing potential of heterotrophic (HF) and pigmented (PF) nanoflagellates as a response mechanism to phosphate amendment. Flagellate grazing effect on bacteria was quantified in P-amended nutrient-depleted water from the Cretan Sea over the course of 4 days using microcosm experiments. P-addition positively affected HF abundance, while PF abundance remained unchanged. At the community level, P-addition had a negative effect on PF bacterial removal rates. In the control, PF-grazing rate was significantly higher than that of HF throughout the experiment. Pigment analysis showed no changes in phytoplankton community composition as a result of P-addition, indicating that PF grazing rate declined as a physiological response of the cells. The present study emphasizes the dominant grazing role of PF under P-depleted conditions and reveals that during the late stratified season PF respond to P-addition by lowering their grazing rates, enhancing the relative importance of bacterial removal by HF."

Over the last decade, knowledge has significantly increased on the taxonomic identity and distribution of dinoflagellates of the genera <i>Gambierdiscus</i> and <i>Fukuyoa</i>. Additionally, a number of hitherto unknown bioactive metabolites have been described, while the role of these compounds in ciguatera poisoning (CP) remains to be clarified. Ciguatoxins and maitotoxins are very toxic compounds produced by these dinoflagellates and have been described since the 1980s. Ciguatoxins are generally described as the main contributors to this food intoxication. Recent reports of CP in temperate waters of the Canary Islands (Spain) and the Madeira archipelago (Portugal) triggered the need for isolation and cultivation of dinoflagellates from these areas, and their taxonomic and toxicological characterization. Maitotoxins, and specifically maitotoxin-4, has been described as one of the most toxic compounds produced by these dinoflagellates (e.g., <i>G. excentricus</i>) in the Canary Islands. Thus, characterization of toxin profiles of <i>Gambierdiscus</i> species from adjacent regions appears critical. The combination of liquid chromatography coupled to either low- or high-resolution mass spectrometry allowed for characterization of several strains of <i>Gambierdiscus</i> and <i>Fukuyoa</i> from the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands. Maitotoxin-3, two analogues tentatively identified as gambieric acid C and D, a putative gambierone analogue and a putative gambieroxide were detected in all <i>G. australes</i> strains from Menorca and Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain) while only maitotoxin-3 was present in an <i>F. paulensis</i> strain of the same region. An unidentified <i>Gambierdiscus</i> species (<i>Gambierdiscus</i> sp.2) from Crete (Greece) showed a different toxin profile, detecting both maitotoxin-3 and gambierone, while the availability of a <i>G. excentricus</i> strain from the Canary Islands (Spain) confirmed the presence of maitotoxin-4 in this species. Overall, this study shows that toxin profiles not only appear to be species-specific but probably also specific to larger geographic regions.

Human-induced biodiversity loss has been accelerating since the industrial revolution. The climate change impacts will severely alter the biodiversity and biogeographical patterns at all scales, leading to biotic homogenization. Due to underfunding, a climate smart, conservation-prioritization scheme is needed to optimize species protection. Spatial phylogenetics enable the identification of endemism centers and provide valuable insights regarding the eco-evolutionary and conservation value, as well as the biogeographical origin of a given area. Many studies exist regarding the conservation prioritization of mainland areas, yet none has assessed how climate change might alter the biodiversity and biogeographical patterns of an island biodiversity hotspot. Thus, we conducted a phylogenetically informed, conservation prioritization study dealing with the effects of climate change on Crete's plant diversity and biogeographical patterns. Using several macroecological analyses, we identified the current and future endemism centers and assessed the impact of climate change on the biogeographical patterns in Crete. The highlands of Cretan mountains have served as both diversity cradles and museums, due to their stable climate and high topographical heterogeneity, providing important ecosystem services. Historical processes seem to have driven diversification and endemic species distribution in Crete. Due to the changing climate and the subsequent biotic homogenization, Crete's unique bioregionalization, which strongly reminiscent the spatial configuration of the Pliocene/Pleistocene Cretan paleo-islands, will drastically change. The emergence of the 'Anthropocene' era calls for the prioritization of biodiversity-rich areas, serving as mixed-endemism centers, with high overlaps among protected areas and climatic refugia.

The history of water supply and wastewater engineering in Crete Island (Greece) dates back more than ca 4,500 years, since the early Bronze Ages. In the Minoan era, it was recognized that the removal of wastewater and storm-water were necessary for communal living. The early Minoan developments in wastewater and storm-water collection and removal are the cornerstones on which modern cities are built. The evolution of wastewater and storm-water management from prehistoric to modern times in Crete is examined briefly in this paper. Information on the current status and future strategies for wastewater and storm-water management is also presented.

Land Cover monitoring is an essential task for a better understanding of the ecosystem's dynamicity and complexity. The availability of Remote Sensing data improved the Land Use Land Cover mapping as it is routine work in ecosystem management. The complexity of the Mediterranean ecosystems involves a complexity of the surrounding environmental factors. An attempt to quantitatively investigate the interdependencies between land covers and affected environmental factors was conducted in Nisos Elafonisos to represent diverse and fragile coastal Mediterranean ecosystems. Sentinel-2 (MSI) sensor and ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were used to classify the LULC as well as to draw different vegetation conditions over the designated study area. DEM derivatives were conducted and incorporated. The developed methodology is intended to assess the land use land cover for different practices under the present environmental condition of Nisos Elafonisos. Supervised classification resulted in six different land cover clusters and was tested against three different environmental clusters. The findings of the current research pointed out that the environmental variables are independent and there is a vertical distribution of the vegetation according to altitude.

Despite Greece being a global hotspot of subterranean biodiversity, its hypogean fauna is largely neglected from both an ecological and conservational point of view. An overview of the Niphargidae occurring in Greece is presented as an annotated list of all available published records. These records have resulted in an updated species list reflecting taxonomic corrections and species distribution range in the Greek peninsula. A total of 23 species, attributed to 3 genera, is up to date known from Greece with a high rate of endemicity found particularly in Crete. The endemic species of Greece amount to 21 (91% of total species richness), with the remaining species distributing also in the Republic of North Macedonia. Currently, none of them is listed in the national, European or global IUCN Red Lists of Threatened Species. Considering the increasing habitat degradation due to anthropic pressure, groundwater harvesting and climate change we could lose rare and endemic species without even acknowledging their existence.

This study summarizes published data on the sand fly fauna of Crete, the results of new sand fly samplings and the description of a new sand fly species. All published and recent samplings were carried out using CDC light traps, sticky traps or mouth aspirators. The specific status of Phlebotomus (Adlerius) creticus n. sp., was assessed by morphological analysis, cytochrome b (cytb) sequencing and MALDI-TOF protein profiling. Published data revealed the presence of 10 Phlebotomus spp. and 2 Sergentomyia spp. During presented field work, 608 specimens of 8 species of Phlebotomus and one species of Sergentomyia were collected. Both published data and present samplings revealed that the two most common and abundant species were Phlebotomus neglectus, a proven vector of Leishmania infantum causing VL, and Ph. similis, a suspected vector of L. tropica causing CL. In addition, the field surveys revealed the presence of a new species, Ph. (Adlerius) creticus n. sp. The identification of the newly described species is based on both molecular and morphological criteria, showing distinct characters of the male genitalia that differentiate it from related species of the subgenus Adlerius as well as species-specific sequence of cytb and protein spectra generated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
PMID:33621882	Kourgialas NN	Sci Total Environ. 775:145857	2021	A critical review of water resources in Greece: The key role of agricultural adaptation to climate-water effects. 	Τhe management and protection of a country's water resources is a matter of high priority, ensuring the development and socio-economic stability of a country. Unquestionably, Greece is a characteristic example of this, as water distribution is highly spatially and temporally unequally distributed, while irrigation and tourist consumers as well as the pollution load are expected to be increased in the near future. Water resources in Greece are particularly affected by climate extremes, with droughts, floods and soil erosion by water being the utmost consequences. Greece consumes the greatest amount of its available water resources in the agricultural sector. Also, there is much evidence of water shortage and bad/poor chemical status of some water bodies, mainly due to saltwater intrusion in coastal agricultural areas and intensively agricultural activities. Therefore, this review provides a literature update on the quantity and quality aspects of water resources in Greece for each water body, focusing on water relation effects (aridity/drought, floods and soil erosion by water). This paper, based on different sources of information and an extensive database of water related data, collects, evaluates and groups data from a quantity and quality point of view for all the different water bodies of Greece. Specific water districts such as the Aegean islands, the eastern part of Crete, Attica and Thessaly are expected to be the most affected by climate-water impacts with reduced crops yields, a greater risk of droughts and/or floods, a loss of agricultural land, declining water availability, and degraded water resources (surface and groundwater). Based on these findings, the proposed review highlights agricultural adaptation practices for increasing water use efficiency, ensuring the sustainability of water resources in Greece.

"The research describes for the first time a possible case of pituitary gigantism in fossil mammals, precisely in deer. The pathology was detected in 2 long bones (tibia and metatarsus) belonging to an individual of an unusual large size found at the Bate cave (Rethymnon, Northern Crete). It formed the basis of Candiacervus major, the largest among the endemic deer species recorded in the Pleistocene-Early Holocene of Crete. Radiological and histomorphological examinations highlighted a reduction in cortical bone thickness and the presence of wide lacunae inside of the bone tissue. The pathological conditions suggest a pituitary gigantism diagnosis also supported by some morphological evidence, such as the extremely elongated distal part of the metatarsal diaphysis, the proportionally small proximal epiphysis, and some bone gracility. The diagnosis of a case of pituitary gigantism as presumed responsible for the extraordinary elongation of the tibia and the metatarsal bone is intriguing as they are, respectively, the paratype and the holotype of the C. major. The species represents a case of a deviation from the ""island rule"" in Pleistocene large mammals. The new evidence recommends a taxonomic and nomenclatural revision of this species. The main outcomes of this research are as follows: (i) a case of pituitary gigantism is described for the first time in an extinct mammal; (ii) it is underlined that paleohistology may provide interesting clues for disentangling taxonomic and nomenclatural issues; (iii) one of the very few cases of gigantism in insular mammals is being questioned."

The introduction and establishment of exotic species often result in significant changes in recipient communities and their associated ecosystem services. However, usually the magnitude and direction of the changes are difficult to quantify because there is no pre-introduction data. Specifically, little is known about the effect of marine exotic macrophytes on organic carbon sequestration and storage. Here, we combine dating sediment cores (<sup>210</sup> Pb) with sediment eDNA fingerprinting to reconstruct the chronology of pre- and post-arrival of the Red Sea seagrass Halophila stipulacea spreading into the Eastern Mediterranean native seagrass meadows. We then compare sediment organic carbon storage and burial rates before and after the arrival of H. stipulacea and between exotic (H. stipulacea) and native (C. nodosa and P. oceanica) meadows since the time of arrival following a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) approach. This analysis revealed that H. stipulacea arrived at the areas of study in Limassol (Cyprus) and West Crete (Greece) in the 1930s and 1970s, respectively. Average sediment organic carbon after the arrival of H. stipulacea to the sites increased in the exotic meadows twofold, from 8.4 ± 2.5 g C<sub>org</sub>  m<sup>-2 </sup> year<sup>-1</sup> to 14.7 ± 3.6 g C<sub>org</sub>  m<sup>-2 </sup> year<sup>-1</sup> , and, since then, burial rates in the exotic seagrass meadows were higher than in native ones of Cymodocea nodosa and Posidonia oceanica. Carbon isotopic data indicated a 50% increase of the seagrass contribution to the total sediment C<sub>org</sub> pool since the arrival of H. stipulacea. Our results demonstrate that the invasion of H. stipulacea may play an important role in maintaining the blue carbon sink capacity in the future warmer Mediterranean Sea, by developing new carbon sinks in bare sediments and colonizing areas previously occupied by the colder thermal affinity P. oceanica.

Seven date palm seeds (<i>Phoenix dactylifera</i> L.), radiocarbon dated from the fourth century BCE to the second century CE, were recovered from archaeological sites in the Southern Levant and germinated to yield viable plants. We conducted whole-genome sequencing of these germinated ancient samples and used single-nucleotide polymorphism data to examine the genetics of these previously extinct Judean date palms. We find that the oldest seeds from the fourth to first century BCE are related to modern West Asian date varieties, but later material from the second century BCE to second century CE showed increasing genetic affinities to present-day North African date palms. Population genomic analysis reveals that by ∼2,400 to 2,000 y ago, the <i>P. dactylifera</i> gene pool in the Eastern Mediterranean already contained introgressed segments from the Cretan palm <i>Phoenix theophrasti</i>, a crucial genetic feature of the modern North African date palm populations. The <i>P. theophrasti</i> introgression fraction content is generally higher in the later samples, while introgression tracts are longer in these ancient germinated date palms compared to modern North African varieties. These results provide insights into crop evolution arising from an analysis of plants originating from ancient germinated seeds and demonstrate what can be accomplished with the application of a resurrection genomics approach.

The wide availability of satellite data from many distributors in different domains of science has provided the opportunity for the development of new and improved methodologies to aid the analysis of environmental problems and to support more reliable estimations and forecasts. Moreover, the rapid development of specialized technologies in satellite instruments provides the opportunity to obtain a wide spectrum of various measurements. The purpose of this research is to use publicly available remote sensing product data computed from geostationary, polar and near-polar satellites and radar to improve space-time modeling and prediction of precipitation on Crete island in Greece. The proposed space-time kriging method carries out the fusion of remote sensing data with data from ground stations that monitor precipitation during the hydrological period 2009/10-2017/18. Precipitation observations are useful for water resources, flood and drought management studies. However, monitoring stations are usually sparse in regions with complex terrain, are clustered in valleys, and often have missing data. Satellite precipitation data are an attractive alternative to observations. The fusion of the datasets in terms of the space-time residual kriging method exploits the auxiliary satellite information and aids in the accurate and reliable estimation of precipitation rates at ungauged locations. In addition, it represents an alternative option for the improved modeling of precipitation variations in space and time. The obtained results were compared with the outcomes of similar works in the study area.

"Primary gypsum deposits, which accumulated in the Mediterranean Basin during the so-called Messinian salinity crisis (5.97-5.33 Ma), represent an excellent archive of microbial life. We investigated the molecular fossil inventory and the corresponding compound-specific δ<sup>13</sup> C values of bottom-grown gypsum formed during the first stage of the crisis in four marginal basins across the Mediterranean (Nijar, Spain; Vena del Gesso, Italy; Heraklion, Crete; and Psematismenos, Cyprus). All studied gypsum samples contain intricate networks of filamentous microfossils, whose phylogenetic affiliation has been debated for a long time. Petrographic analysis, molecular fossil inventories (hydrocarbons, alcohols, and carboxylic acids), and carbon stable isotope patterns suggest that the mazes of filamentous fossils represent benthic microbial assemblages dominated by chemotrophic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria; in some of the samples, the body fossils are accompanied by lipids produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Abundant isoprenoid alcohols including diphytanyl glycerol diethers (DGDs) and glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), typified by highly variable carbon stable isotope composition with δ<sup>13</sup> C values spanning from -40 to -14‰, reveal the presence of planktic and benthic archaeal communities dwelling in Messinian paleoenvironments. The compound inventory of archaeal lipids indicates the existence of a stratified water column, with a normal marine to diluted upper water column and more saline deeper waters. This study documents the lipid biomarker inventory of microbial life preserved in ancient gypsum deposits, helping to reconstruct the widely debated conditions under which Messinian gypsum formed."

This baseline intends to report on littering related to single-use plastic straws, contextualized on two touristic beaches on the Northern shores of Crete (Greece). While beached straws were found to be mainly depending on local drivers, the study further highlighted an additional source of pollution related to plastic straws: the clear wrap in which single-use items can be offered to users. Over the summer months, a number of discarded straw wraps was in fact found, significantly related to both beach width and the presence of colorful straws. Wraps are different in shape, material, as well as likelihood of being dispersed and broken down in the environment, and easily escape estimates from non-targeted sampling. The ban on single use items seems then to be the most effective approach to avoid straws and, indirectly, straw wraps litter or spills.

Crete with its complex geomorphological history is the island with the highest number of endemism observed in animal and plant taxa throughout the Aegean archipelago. While other groups of organisms within Crete are well-studied, the freshwater gastropod fauna still remains poorly investigated. Bythinella and Pseudamnicola, are 2 genera of freshwater springsnails, both present on the island, inhabiting springs and other freshwater habitats. Here, we conduct a comprehensive study on the distribution of the different genetic lineages of the 2 gastropod genera in order to assess the mode of their differentiation on the island and infer the actual number of species present in the island. Towards these aims, sequence data from the mitochondrial gene were used and analyzed within a phylogenetic framework. For Bythinella, our results strongly support at least 5 delineated Bythinella spp. inhabiting Crete, which correspond to the already described species from previous studies with the addition of a new one. Bythinella analyses reveal an old time-frame of differentiation with vicariant phenomena being more likely the main drivers shaping the present-day distribution of the genus' genetic lineages. For Pseudamnicola, our data indicate the presence of at least 2 delineated Pseudamnicola spp. with a differentiation more consistent to an isolation-by-distance pattern of a relatively recent origin. Dispersion processes followed by isolation of the populations and/or recent speciation, seem to be the underlying process for the current distribution of Pseudamnicola lineages.

The study of insular populations was key in the development of evolutionary theory. The successful colonisation of an island depends on the geographic context, and specific characteristics of the organism and the island, but also on stochastic processes. As a result, apparently identical islands may harbour populations with contrasting histories. Here, we use whole genome sequences of 65 barn owls to investigate the patterns of inbreeding and genetic diversity of insular populations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We focus on Crete and Cyprus, islands with similar size, climate and distance to mainland, that provide natural replicates for a comparative analysis of the impacts of microevolutionary processes on isolated populations. We show that barn owl populations from each island have a separate origin, Crete being genetically more similar to other Greek islands and mainland Greece, and Cyprus more similar to the Levant. Further, our data show that their respective demographic histories following colonisation were also distinct. On the one hand, Crete harbours a small population and maintains very low levels of gene flow with neighbouring populations. This has resulted in low genetic diversity, strong genetic drift, increased relatedness in the population and remote inbreeding. Cyprus, on the other hand, appears to maintain enough gene flow with the mainland to avoid such an outcome. Our study provides a comparative population genomic analysis of the effects of neutral processes on a classical island-mainland model system. It provides empirical evidence for the role of stochastic processes in determining the fate of diverging isolated populations.

The invasion of the tetrodotoxin (TTX)-bearing silver-cheeked toadfish and potential poisoning due to its consumption (tetrodotoxication) threatens public safety in the Mediterranean Sea. In this study, TTX and TTX analogues of <i>Lagocephalus sceleratus</i> (Gmelin, 1789) were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in fish collected off the island of Crete (Southern Mediterranean). We tested the synergistic effect of a suite of factors potentially affecting toxins' levels and tetrodotoxication risk using general and generalized linear models, respectively. The type of tissue, geographic origin (Cretan Sea, Libyan Sea), sex, and fish maturity stage were significant predictors of toxin concentrations. Mean TTX was higher in gonads and lower in muscles, higher in the Libyan Sea and in female fish, and lower in juvenile (virgin) fish. The concentration of TTX was also significantly and positively correlated with the concentration of several TTX analogues (4-epiTTX, 4,9-anhydroTTX, 11-deoxyTTX, 5,11/6,11-dideoxyTTX, 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX, 11-norTTX-6-ol). The analysis showed that fish originating from the Libyan Sea had significantly higher probability to cause tetrodotoxication in case of consumption. The variability explained by the models developed in this study was relatively low, indicating that toxin levels are hard to predict and the consumption of <i>L. sceleratus</i> should therefore be avoided.

Hybridization is increasingly recognized as an important evolutionary force. Novel genetic methods now enable us to address how the genomes of parental species are combined in hybrid lineages. However, we still do not know the relative importance of admixed proportions, genome architecture and local selection in shaping hybrid genomes. Here, we take advantage of the genetically divergent island populations of Italian sparrow on Crete, Corsica and Sicily to investigate the predictors of genomic variation within a hybrid taxon. We test if differentiation is affected by recombination rate, selection, or variation in ancestry proportions. We find that the relationship between recombination rate and differentiation is less pronounced within hybrid lineages than between the parent species, as expected if purging of minor parent ancestry in low recombination regions reduces the variation available for differentiation. In addition, we find that differentiation between islands is correlated with differences in signatures of selection in two out of three comparisons. Signatures of selection within islands are correlated across all islands, suggesting that shared selection may mould genomic differentiation. The best predictor of strong differentiation within islands is the degree of differentiation from house sparrow, and hence loci with Spanish sparrow ancestry may vary more freely. Jointly, this suggests that constraints and selection interact in shaping the genomic landscape of differentiation in this hybrid species.

"High-mountain plant communities are strongly determined by abiotic conditions, especially low temperature, and are therefore susceptible to effects of climate warming. Rising temperatures, however, also lead to increased evapotranspiration, which, together with projected shifts in seasonal precipitation patterns, could lead to prolonged, detrimental water deficiencies. The current study aims at comparing alpine plant communities along elevation and water availability gradients from humid conditions (north-eastern Alps) to a moderate (Central Apennines) and a pronounced dry period during summer (Lefka Ori, Crete) in the Mediterranean area. We do this in order to (1) detect relationships between community-based indices (plant functional leaf and growth traits, thermic vegetation indicator, plant life forms, vegetation cover and diversity) and soil temperature and snow duration and (2) assess if climatic changes have already affected the vegetation, by determining directional changes over time (14-year period; 2001-2015) in these indices in the three regions. Plant community indices responded to decreasing temperatures along the elevation gradient in the NE-Alps and the Apennines, but this elevation effect almost disappeared in the summer-dry mountains of Crete. This suggests a shift from low-temperature to drought-dominated ecological filters. Leaf trait (Leaf Dry Matter Content and Specific Leaf Area) responses changed in direction from the Alps to the Apennines, indicating that drought effects already become discernible at the northern margin of the Mediterranean. Over time, a slight increase in vegetation cover was found in all regions, but thermophilisation occurred only in the NE-Alps and Apennines, accompanied by a decline of cold-adapted cushion plants in the Alps. On Crete, xeromorphic shrubs were increasing in abundance. Although critical biodiversity losses have not yet been observed, an intensified monitoring of combined warming-drought impacts will be required in view of threatened alpine plants that are either locally restricted in the south or weakly adapted to drought in the north."

Modeling and forecasting spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation is crucial for managing water resources and mitigating water-related hazards. Globally valid spatiotemporal models of precipitation are not available. This is due to the intermittent nature, non-Gaussian distribution, and complex geographical dependence of precipitation processes. Herein we propose a data-driven model of precipitation amount which employs a novel, data-driven (non-parametric) implementation of warped Gaussian processes. We investigate the proposed warped Gaussian process regression (wGPR) using (i) a synthetic test function contaminated with non-Gaussian noise and (ii) a reanalysis dataset of monthly precipitation from the Mediterranean island of Crete. Cross-validation analysis is used to establish the advantages of non-parametric warping for the interpolation of incomplete data. We conclude that wGPR equipped with the proposed data-driven warping provides enhanced flexibility and-at least for the cases studied- improved predictive accuracy for non-Gaussian data.

"Pollen identification is an important task for the botanical certification of honey. It is performed via thorough microscopic examination of the pollen present in honey; a process called melissopalynology. However, manual examination of the images is hard, time-consuming and subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. In this study, we investigated the applicability of deep learning models for the classification of pollen-grain images into 20 pollen types, based on the Cretan Pollen Dataset. In particular, we applied transfer and ensemble learning methods to achieve an accuracy of 97.5%, a sensitivity of 96.9%, a precision of 97%, an F1 score of 96.89% and an AUC of 0.9995. However, in a preliminary case study, when we applied the best-performing model on honey-based pollen-grain images, we found that it performed poorly; only 0.02 better than random guessing (i.e., an AUC of 0.52). This indicates that the model should be further fine-tuned on honey-based pollen-grain images to increase its effectiveness on such data."

The rangelands of Crete island (Greece) are typical Mediterranean habitats under high risk of degradation due to long-term grazing and harsh climatic conditions. We explored the effect of abiotic (climatic conditions, altitude) and biotic factors (long-term grazing by small ruminants) on the floristic composition and diversity of selected lowland (Pyrathi, Faistos) and highland (Vroulidia, Nida) rangelands. In each rangeland, the ground cover was measured, and the floristic composition was calculated in terms of five functional groups: grasses, legumes, forbs, phrygana, and shrubs. The aridity index, species turnover, species richness, Shannon entropy, and Gini-Simpson index (with the latter two converted to the effective number of species) were calculated. Our results reveal that highlands are characterized by the highest aridity index (wetter conditions). Lowland rangelands, compared to highland, exhibited a higher percentage contribution of grasses, legumes, and forbs, while species turnover decreased along the altitudinal gradient. The Shannon entropy index was correlated (a) positively with Gini-Simpson and mean annual temperature and (b) negatively with mean annual precipitation, aridity index, and altitude. Moreover, the Gini-Simpson index correlated positively with mean annual temperature and negatively with altitude. Our results could help to understand the effects of grazing on rangeland dynamics and sustainability in semi-arid regions in the context of climatic change.

The aim of this paper is the creation of an integrated and free-access web platform for parcel irrigation water management on a large spatial scale (Water District of Crete, in Greece) in order to: a) accurately determine the irrigation needs of the main crops for Crete such as olives, citrus, avocados and vineyards, b) design strategies, for optimal adaptation of the agricultural sector in the context of climate change, and c) incorporate the dynamic integration of the above information through the creation of a digital platform. In the proposed decision-making system, essential factors are taken into account, such as real-time meteorological data, information about the type and spatial distribution of the agricultural parcels in Crete, algorithms for calculation crop evapotranspiration per development stage and age of the crops, satellite remote sensing techniques in combination with field surveys to depict accurate soil texture map for the whole island of Crete as well as sustainable cultivation practices for saving water per crop and parcel geomorphology. Based on the proposed decision-making system, users will have the opportunity in any specific location/farm in Crete to know the irrigation needs of the crops in real-time and obtain information about proper climate-water adaptation practices. The main novelty points of the proposed platform include the derivation of parcel-level soil texture data from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and field samples, the comprehensiveness of the irrigation management information, the relatively low data requirements and the application interface simplicity provided to the end-user.

A coupled hydrodynamic/lagrangian particle drift model was applied to obtain the distribution of key radionuclides that are dispersed at the surface water (upper 100 m) of Eastern Mediterranean Sea, in case of an accident of Nuclear Power Plant at Akkuyu. The model was applied to simulate the dispersion of key artificial radionuclide concentration, in case of a hypothetical accident to assess issues related to sea health and potential hazards. The released radionuclide was found to have a favorable westward direction, following the prevailing currents. The variability of the predicted pattern is interpreted according to the near surface circulation patterns in the study area. The dispersion of key radionuclides (<sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>238</sup>Pu and <sup>131</sup>I) was studied in a spatial and temporal manner at the neighboring coasts of the location of the NPP. Furthermore, the fate of the plume was predicted for each month after the accident date close to the areas of Akkuyu, namely Cyprus, Rhodes Island, North Cretan coast, Cyclades and Syrian Coast. The annual study revealed that the radioactive plume is present with high concentration (maximum values of 1200 Bq m<sup>-3</sup> for the long lived isotopes and 600 Bq m<sup>-3</sup> for <sup>131</sup>I) in the location of the plant for short period of time (1-2 months), while the other areas are affected during the whole year with low level of activity concentration (20-50 Bqm<sup>-3</sup>).

Population connectivity studies are a useful tool for species management and conservation planning, particular of highly threatened or endangered species. Here, we evaluated the genetic structure and connectivity pattern of the endangered coral <i>Cladocora caespitosa</i> across its entire distribution range in the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, we examined the relative importance of sexual and asexual reproduction in the studied populations and their genetic diversity. A total of 541 individuals from 20 localities were sampled and analysed with 19 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Of the genotyped individuals, 482 (89%) had unique multilocus genotypes. Clonality percentages of the populations varied from 0% (in eight populations) to nearly 69% (in one population from Crete). A heterozygosity deficit and a high degree of inbreeding was the general trend in our data set. Population differentiation in <i>C. caespitosa</i> was characterised by significant pairwise <i>F</i> <sub><i>ST</i></sub> values with lower ones observed at an intraregional scale and higher ones, between populations from different biogeographic regions. Genetic structure analyses showed that the populations are divided according to the three main sub-basins of the Mediterranean Sea: the Western (Balearic, Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas), the Central (Adriatic and Ionian seas) and the Eastern (Levantine and Aegean seas), coinciding with previously described gene flow barriers. However, the three easternmost populations were also clearly separated from one another, and a substructure was observed for the other studied areas. An isolation-by-distance pattern was found among, but not within, the three main population groups. This substructure is mediated mainly by dispersal along the coastline and some resistance to larval movement through the open sea. Despite the low dispersal ability and high self-recruitment rate of <i>C. caespitosa</i>, casual dispersive events between regions seem to be enough to maintain the species' considerable genetic diversity. Understanding the population connectivity and structure of this endangered scleractinian coral allows for more informed conservation decision making.

"Iuridae is a family of scorpions that exhibits a highly complex biogeographic and taxonomic history. Iuridae taxa are mainly found in Turkey and Greece, whereas a single species is found in northern Iraq. Several taxonomic revisions have been conducted on this family that initially comprised two genera. The latest taxonomic review, based on morphological and anatomical features, raised the number of Iuridae genera to four, and the number of species to 14. Sequence data from three molecular markers (COX1, 16S rDNA, ITS1) originating from numerous Iuridae taxa were analyzed within a phylogenetic framework. Divergence time-estimate analyses, species delimitation approaches and estimation of ancestral areas were implemented in order to: (1) reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the Iuridae taxa, (2) evaluate the morphological classifications, and (3) obtain insights into the biogeographic history of the family in the East Mediterranean. The multi-locus phylogeny clearly confirms an ancient division into two clades, Calchinae and Iurinae. Ancient patterns of isolation and dispersal are revealed. Both subfamilies are largely confined to the Anatolian peninsula and its few coastal islands; only the most derived genus Iurus has dispersed westward to Crete and Peloponnese. Based on our findings, three new genera of Iurinae (Metaiurus, Anatoliurus, and Letoiurus) are established. The genus Neocalchas emerges as one of the most ancient scorpion clades, with divergence time about 27 mya."

Hypogastrura gisini Strenzke, 1954 is redescribed based on paratypes and other available material. A description of similar new species from CreteH. cretensis sp. nov., formerly known as H. cf. gisini sensu Ellis (1976), is also provided. Both species belong to the manubrialis group and resemble H. breviempodialis (Stach, 1949), H. tianshanica Martynova, 1970 and H. ubsunurensis Babenko, 1999, which have a retinaculum with 3 + 3 teeth and a maxillary head of the H. vernalis type. H. gisini has a unique combination of morphological characters: claws without inner tooth, empodium shorter than half inner edge of claw, without basal lamella and setae m1 on abdominal tergum V usually absent. This species prefers sandy habitats on the shores of the Baltic Sea, Kattegat, North Sea, Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea. H. cretensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from its congeners by a combination of the following features: claws with small inner tooth, empodium with basal lamella equal to or slightly longer than half of the inner edge of claws and setae m1 on abdominal tergum V usually present. The new species seems to be associated with anthropogenic habitats mainly (e.g. roadsides, orchards, meadows) in the interior of Crete.

A fish kill was recorded at the Aposelemis Dam, which is the main reservoir of drinking water for the island of Crete in Greece. Hundreds of goldfish were found dead at a side stream which provides water to the reservoir. The affected fish had been entrapped in a small pond at the side of the stream with practically zero water renewal as the event occurred in August which is a dry season for the island of Crete. The event was alarming for the local community since anthropogenic pollution was initially suspected which could pose a significant human health threat. Following examination of the fish, the mortality was attributed to heavy infection by the parasitic flagellate, Ichthyobodo sp., whilst no pollutants were detected. The parasite was studied through light and scanning electron microscopy and was identified molecularly.

The seagrass <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> forms extensive meadows in the Mediterranean Sea. Studies on their associated highly diverse invertebrate assemblages are limited to the western Mediterranean. The eastern Mediterranean, however, is a basin undergoing rapid change due to the synergistic effects of climate warming, biological invasions and other human stressors that are driving native biodiversity to regional-scale collapses. We here surveyed the shelled molluscan assemblage of a <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> meadow in Plakias, south-western Crete, the first such study in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. This area has increased its yearly mean temperature by 1 °C in the last 20 years and is under heavy pressure by Lessepsian species. We sampled across a 5- to 20-m depth gradient, in two seasons to capture intra-annual variation and the leaf and rhizome strata separately. Against our expectations, the molluscan assemblage proved to be highly diverse, with species richness, dominant species and trophic guilds comparable to healthy western Mediterranean ones, and with a negligible non-indigenous component. The diversity of the native community (following the biotic resistance hypothesis) and oxygen supersaturation in the meadow may cause greater resistance to biological invasions and warming, respectively, suggesting that <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> meadows may act as a precious refugium for native biodiversity in the fast changing eastern Mediterranean Sea.

Microplastics are substrates for microbial activity and can influence biomass production. This has potentially important implications in the sea-surface microlayer, the marine boundary layer that controls gas exchange with the atmosphere and where biologically produced organic compounds can accumulate. In the present study, we used six large scale mesocosms to simulate future ocean scenarios of high plastic concentration. Each mesocosm was filled with 3 m<sup>3</sup> of seawater from the oligotrophic Sea of Crete, in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. A known amount of standard polystyrene microbeads of 30 μm diameter was added to three replicate mesocosms, while maintaining the remaining three as plastic-free controls. Over the course of a 12-day experiment, we explored microbial organic matter dynamics in the sea-surface microlayer in the presence and absence of microplastic contamination of the underlying water. Our study shows that microplastics increased both biomass production and enrichment of carbohydrate-like and proteinaceous marine gel compounds in the sea-surface microlayer. Importantly, this resulted in a ∼3 % reduction in the concentration of dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> in the underlying water. This reduction was associated to both direct and indirect impacts of microplastic pollution on the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> within the marine carbon cycle, by modifying the biogenic composition of the sea's boundary layer with the atmosphere.

The impact of otter trawling on the relationship between functional traits of benthic invertebrates and specific biogeochemical processes were investigated in the oligotrophic Cretan Sea. The fishery is managed through a seasonal closure during the summer. During two seasons (winter and summer) replicate samples were taken from the field from a commercial trawl ground and an adjacent control area. Environmental parameters related to sediment biogeochemistry were measured including particulate organic carbon, sedimentary organic carbon, bottom water and sedimentary chlorophyll a and phaeopigment concentrations as well as benthic oxygen consumption. A significant impact of trawling was recorded only for bottom water chlorophyll and sedimentary organic carbon. Furthermore, the links between species traits and specific ecosystem processes were affected by trawling, highlighting the importance of unique functional modalities on ecosystem functioning. The traits that mostly influenced benthic biogeochemistry in the control sites were related to bioturbation and burrowing activities. In contrast, in the trawled sites, the associated traits were related to more opportunistic lifestyles and deposit feeding species that do not act as bioturbators. Thus, under trawling disturbance, this shift can decouple the species-sediment relations and affect nutrient cycling.

"In Greece, the implementation of the Water Framework Directive for rivers is based mainly on benthic macroinvertebrates and uses a semi-quantitative method with a D-frame net, which is certified by the International Organization for Standardization. Before the official adoption of this method, a quantitative shovel sampler (""Cretan shovel"") was used in southern Greece (Crete), which has been implemented for almost three decades due to the specific river habitats found in Crete (e.g., seasonal flow, narrow riverbeds, and coarse substrates). In this study, we compared community metrics, diversity indices, feeding groups, locomotion types, and ecological quality derived from data collected using timed semi-quantitative kick samples and quantitative shovel samples collected from the same sites simultaneously. In total, 20 samples from the north and south of Greece were collected. The majority of community metrics, diversity indices, and traits were comparable between samplers. However, there were statistically significant differences in the relative abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, passive filterers' and the (semi) sessil groups, and Pielou's index. Most differences in the ecological quality between the kick and shovel samples were observed in 50% of the sites in northern Greece because the shovel is less effective at capturing motile zoobenthos. The ecological quality assessment in Crete by the Cretan shovel is comparable with the D-frame net in 75% of the samples. Thus, the Cretan shovel could efficiently sample the Cretan streams, which are characterized by coarse, narrow, turbulent, and hydrologically fluctuating river habitats. Such comparisons could improve sampling effectiveness and make additional data available to assess ecological quality."

"<i>Origanum dictamnus</i> L. is a medicinal local endemic to the Island of Crete, Greece. Its propagation through biotechnological tissue culture techniques is essential due to its augmented multi-industrial sector demand. For direct organogenesis, among different culture media variants (MS, Gamborg B5), and cytokinins [6-benzyladenine (BA), kinetin (Kin), 2-isopentenyl adenine (2-iP)], the MS + added with BA (2.2 μM) was the most effective treatment for shoots and roots formation. For indirect organogenesis, all explant types (leaves, petioles, roots) showed a 100% callusing rate after 2 months in all media variants tested; ODK1: 20 μM thidiazuron (TDZ) + 5 μM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) or ODK2: 0.5 μM kinetin + 5 μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D). The leaves and petiole explants assured a low rate of shoot regeneration (20%) in ODK1. Afterwards, leaf-, petiole-and root-callus derived from both media were transferred to four new media plant growth regulators-free or with BA + IBA + gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>). After 10 months from callus transferring, the petiole callus gave rise to roots (20-75%) while the leaf callus exhibited 10-30% shoot or 30% root regeneration. In this study, indirect organogenesis of <i>O. dictamnus</i> was carried out for the first time, thus various organs can be used for plant regeneration, and the developed protocol may be applicable in the horticulture industry."

"Ciliate conjugation is considered a rare event to encounter in the field and it is mostly reported from cultures. In this work, we describe a synchronized conjugation event of planktonic ciliates that was discovered twice; in September 2019, at two different locations in the Cretan Sea, Eastern Mediterranean, and in October 2020. In 2019, first, at 2 m depth of the coastal station POSEIDON-HCB, in samples fixed with acid Lugol and formaldehyde, we found 340 and 200 mating pairs L<sup>-1</sup>of different ciliate species, respectively; and second, at the Heraklion port, we found 220 mating pairs L<sup>-1</sup> of <i>Strombidinopsis</i> sp. and 1960 mating pairs L<sup>-1</sup> of <i>Strombidium</i> sp. At the Heraklion port visited again in 2020, we found 800 mating pairs L<sup>-1</sup> of <i>Strombidinopsis</i> sp. and 200 mating pairs L<sup>-1</sup> of <i>Strombidium</i> sp. Since detailed descriptions of conjugation in pelagic oligotrich ciliates are missing, our observations indicate that ciliate conjugation could be a frequent and periodic phenomenon, under specific conditions."

Charismatic species drives decisions for the conservation of marine areas in the view of the coverage of the Natura 2000 sites in the European Union and other forms of Marine Protected Areas in Europe. However, when used solely, critical seascapes and habitats are systematically ignored and practically it can take decades to fulfill baseline needs on habitats distributions, habitats conservation status and species distributions and biodiversity assessments. Luckily, in the last decade, the use of new technologies in conjunction with scientific diving and budget friendly hydroacoustic tools and applications, has allowed to fill the gap in knowledge in such situations and seascapes. The current work demonstrates the use of Earth Observation and Science Dive to fill the gap of knowledge in a newly established Natura 2000 area in Crete, Greece, East Mediterranean, paving the road for replicable approaches in similar situations.

Mediterranean ports are sources of significant economic activity and at the same time they act as recipients of considerable anthropogenic disturbance and pollution. Polluted and low-in-oxygen sediments can negatively impact benthic biodiversity and favour recruitment of opportunistic or invasive species. Macrobenthic communities are an important component of the port biota and can be used as environmental quality indicators. However, a baseline database for benthic biodiversity in Mediterranean ports has not yet been widely established. Macrobenthic assemblages were recorded in three Mediterranean touristic ports under the framework of the ENPI CBC MED project MAPMED (MAnagement of Port Areas in the MEDiterranean Sea Basin). Samples were collected from Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy), Heraklion (Crete, Greece) and El Kantaoui (Tunisia) ports during February, May and September 2012. The sampling stations were selected according to the different sectors within each port (i.e. leisure, fishing, passenger/cargo vessels and shipyard). A total of 277 taxa belonging to 12 phyla were found, of which the 96 taxa were present in all three ports. El Kantaoui port hosted the highest number of macrobenthic taxa. Mollusca were the most abundant group (34%) in all ports. The highest percentage of opportunistic taxa per station was found before the touristic period in the shipyard of Heraklion port (89.3%).

"Wild-growing Greek tulips are protected plants but almost nothing is known about their natural nutrient status and rhizosphere fungal morphotypes in the wild, thus no insight is currently available into their growth and adaptation to their natural environment or artificial settings. To this end, several botanical expeditions were conducted with a special collection permit, and 34 tulip and soil samples were collected, representing 13 species from two phytogeographical regions of Greece (North Aegean Islands, Crete Island) and seven regions of mainland Greece. The tulips' content in essential macro- and micro-nutrients, respective physicochemical soil properties, and rhizosphere fungal morphotypes were assessed across samples, and all parameters were subjected to appropriate statistical analysis to determine their interrelationships. The results showed that soil variables played a significant role in shaping tulips' nutrient content, explaining up to 67% of the detected variability as in the case of phosphorus (P) in the above-ground plant tissue. In addition, significant correlations were observed (with an <i>r</i> value of up to 0.65, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001) between essential nutrients in the tulips, such as calcium (Ca) and boron (B). The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that between the three spatial units examined, the total variability of tulips' nutrient content produced a clear distinction among sampled species, while the first two PCA axes managed to explain 44.3% of it. This was further confirmed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) results which showed corresponding significant differences (at <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in both the tulips' nutrient content and the studied soil properties as well (mean values of N, P, and K in the North Aegean Islands tulips' nutrient content, up to 53%, 119%, and 54% higher compared to those of the Crete Island, respectively). Our study sheds light on Greek tulips' adaptability and resilience in their original habitats, facilitating at the same time the undertaken efforts regarding their conservation and potential domestication in artificial settings."

The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), holds an impressive record of successful invasion events promoted by globalization in fruit trade and human mobility. In addition, C. capitata is gradually expanding its geographic distribution to cooler temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Cold tolerance of C. capitata seems to be a crucial feature that promotes population establishment and hence invasion success. To elucidate the interplay between the invasion process in the northern hemisphere and cold tolerance of geographically isolated populations of C. capitata, we determined (a) the response to acute cold stress survival of adults, and (b) the supercooling capacity (SCP) of immature stages and adults. To assess the phenotypic plasticity in these populations, the effect of acclimation to low temperatures on acute cold stress survival in adults was also examined. The results revealed that survival after acute cold stress was positively related to low temperature acclimation, except for females originating from Thessaloniki (northern Greece). Adults from the warmer environment of South Arava (Israel) were less tolerant after acute cold stress compared with those from Heraklion (Crete, Greece) and Thessaloniki. Plastic responses to cold acclimation were population specific, with the South Arava population being more plastic compared to the two Greek populations. For SCP, the results revealed that there is little to no correlation between SCP and climate variables of the areas where C. capitata populations originated. SCP was much lower than the lowest temperature individuals are likely to experience in their respective habitats. These results set the stage for asking questions regarding the evolutionary adaptive processes that facilitate range expansions of C. capitata into cooler temperate areas of Europe.

Maritime transport is a vital sector for global trade and the world economy. Particularly for islands, there is also an important social dimension of this sector, since island communities strongly rely on it for a connection with the mainland and the transportation of goods and passengers. Furthermore, islands are exceptionally vulnerable to climate change, as the rising sea level and extreme events are expected to induce severe impacts. Such hazards are anticipated to also affect the operations of the maritime transport sector by affecting either the port infrastructure or ships en route. The present study is an effort to better comprehend and assess the future risk of maritime transport disruption in six European islands and archipelagos, and it aims at supporting regional to local policy and decision-making. We employ state-of-the-art regional climate datasets and the widely used impact chain approach to identify the different components that might drive such risks. Larger islands (e.g., Corsica, Cyprus and Crete) are found to be more resilient to the impacts of climate change on maritime operations. Our findings also highlight the importance of adopting a low-emission pathway, since this will keep the risk of maritime transport disruption similar to present levels or even slightly decreased for some islands because of an enhanced adaptation capacity and advantageous demographic changes.

"	Currently, the use of medicinal plants has increased. <i>Artemisia</i> species have been used in several applications, including medicinal use and uses in cosmetics, foods and beverages. <i>Artemisia arborescens</i> L. and <i>Artemisia inculta</i> are part of the Mediterranean diet in the form of aqueous infusions. Herein, we aimed to compare the secondary metabolites of the decoctions and two different extracts (methanolic and aqueous-glycerolic) of these two species, as well as their antioxidant capacity and trace metal levels. Total phenolic, total flavonoid, total terpenes, total hydroxycinnamate, total flavonol, total anthocyanin contents and antioxidant/antiradical activity were determined, and GC/MS analysis was applied to identify and quantify phenolics and terpenoids. Trace metals were quantified with ICP-MS. Aqueous-glycerolic extracts demonstrated higher levels of total secondary metabolites, greater antioxidant potential and higher terpenoid levels than decoctions and methanolic extracts. Subsequently, the aqueous-glycerolic extract of a particularly high phenolic content was further analyzed applying targeted LC-MS/MS as the most appropriate analytic tool for the determination of the phenolic profile. Overall, twenty-two metabolites were identified. The potential contribution of infusions consumption to metal intake was additionally evaluated, and did not exceed the recommended daily intake. Our results support the use of these two species in several food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical applications.

Wetlands are of great importance for providing the appropriate conditions for the diversity of species and inhabitants living in these ecosystems and for a wide range of public goods and services (fresh water, air filtering, recreational and tourism opportunities). However, despite their importance, wetlands are continuously degraded due to various human activities at an alarming rate worldwide. In the context of this study and considering the rational management of wetlands and the inevitable impact of climate change, a wetland, spatiotemporal monitoring system is proposed, implemented in the karst wetland of Almyros Stream (Heraklion, Crete, Greece). The implementation of this system is based on robust techniques from the allied fields of chemistry, earth and ecology assisted by GIS techniques. Our results indicate that this Mediterranean karst wetland of great ecological importance is under pressure because of pollution, climate change and land change. This argument is supported by (a) the high concentrations of water photosynthetic pigments and nutrients at certain times of the year, both provided by chemical analysis and partially verified by geophysical monitoring (spectral induced polarization) and (b) the high values of soil magnetic susceptibility at sites close to human infrastructures that is an indicator of heavy metals concentrations.

"In May 2022, rot symptoms were observed 5 days after storage on fresh avocado fruits cv ""Lamb Hass"" harvested from a 3.4 ha organic orchard in Chania, Crete exhibiting 30% symptom incidence. Brownish-green sunken lesions and soft rot with dark brown lesions covering up to 50% of the mesocarp on fruits and blackish soft lesions on fruit stem ends were observed. To isolate the pathogens, fruits were surface sterilized using 1% NaOCl for 1 min, placed in 70% ethanol for 30 s and washed twice with sterile distilled water. Then, small pieces were excised from the fruit rot margins and transferred on PDA amended with 0.015% streptomycin-sulfate. Single-spore isolates were incubated on PDA for 10 days and subjected to morphological examination. Two distinct pathogenic fungal isolates were obtained, and their symptoms were re-examined on avocado fruits. The first isolate (A1) obtained from the fruit stem end, initially produced hyaline dense aerial mycelia, being gray and black on the upper and lower surface of the Petri dishes, respectively. The second isolate (A2) obtained from the main body of the fruit, formed round, grayish colonies, with orange conidial aggregates. Based on morphological characteristics (Phillips et al.,2013; Weir et al., 2012), isolates were preliminary identified as Neofusicoccum sp. (A1) and Colletotrichum sp. (A2). Isolates were molecularly identified by sequencing of the ITS-5.8S rRNA, translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) and beta-tubulin (tub2) genes. PCRs were conducted using primer pairs ITS4/ITS5, EF1-728F/EF1986R and Bt2a/Bt2b as well as ITS4/ITS5 and 5'-tef1/3'-tef1 and Bt2a/Bt2b for isolates A1 and A2, respectively (Carbone &amp; Kohn, 1999; Glass &amp; Donaldson, 1995; Rojas et al., 2010; Weir et al., 2012; White et al., 1990). The sequences were deposited into GenBank under the accession numbers OQ852465, OQ867962, OQ867965 for N. luteum and, OQ852466, OQ867963 and OQ867964 for C. gloeosporioides. Based on Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), a phylogenetic tree was constructed using concatenated sequences, following Kimura's two parameter model (1980), which confirmed their identity as N luteum and C. gloeosporioides strains. Mature avocado fruits (cv. Hass) were surface sterilized and dried. Consequently, incised fruits were inoculated with mycelial agar plugs (5 mm in diameter) cut from the edge of rapidly growing colonies of N. luteum and C. gloeosporioides strains. Fruits incubated in moist chambers and at 25°C for 5 days in the dark. Fruit bodies and stems were inoculated with the respective isolates and sterile agar plugs in the case of the control. Five fruits were used for each pathogenic trial per fungal isolate, which was repeated twice. After symptom occurrence, these pathogenic isolates were re-isolated successfully and molecularly identified, while exhibiting similar to original symptoms confirming Koch's postulates. While other reports exist on the presence of these pathogens in different countries worldwide, this is the first report of C. gloeosporioides and N. luteum as post-harvest pathogens of avocado, which is an economically important crop of Crete, in Greece (Akgül et al., 2016). This study provides the means for the accurate identification of these fungal pathogens causing avocado fruit rots and taking into consideration the available treatment options can contribute to establishing effective management strategies."

Several important habitats have become threatened in the last few centuries in the Mediterranean Basin due to major changes adopted in land-use practices. The consequent loss of natural and seminatural orchid habitats leads to the appreciation of small anthropogenic habitats, such as cemeteries and roadside verges. Colonization of cemeteries and roadside verges by orchids has long been known, but no study to date compared the suitability of these two anthropogenic habitats for orchids. Therefore, in this paper our aim was to survey cemeteries and roadside verges and to compare these two habitats regarding their role in conserving Mediterranean terrestrial orchids. We conducted field surveys in three Mediterranean islands, Cyprus, Crete, and Lesbos, where both cemeteries and roadside verges were sampled on a geographically representative scale. We found a total of almost 7,000 orchid individuals, belonging to 77 species in the two anthropogenic habitat types. Roadside verges hosted significantly more individuals than cemeteries in Crete and Lesbos, and significantly more species across all three islands. Our results suggest that although cemeteries have a great potential conservation value in other parts of the world, intensive maintenance practices that characterized cemeteries in these three islands renders them unable to sustain valuable plant communities.
