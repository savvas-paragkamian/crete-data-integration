"Hemoglobin Crete, beta129 (h7)ala leads to pro, is a new mutant hemoglobin (Hb) with high oxygen affinity that was discovered in a Greek family in various combinations with beta- and deltabeta-thalassemia. The propositus, who presented an unusual clinical picture of an ""overcompensated"" hemolytic state, with erythrocytosis, splenomegaly, abnormal red cell morphology, and marked erythroid hyperplasia, appeared doubly heterozygous for Hb Crete and deltabeta-thalassemia. His red cells contained 67% Hb Crete and 30% Hb F, and the combination of these two hemoglobins resulted in a blood P50O2 of 11.2 mm Hg. A brother with Hb Crete trait (38% Hb Crete, 56% Hb A, blood P50O2 23.0 mm Hg) did not have significant erythrocytosis. Purified Hb Crete was heat-unstable and exhibited a high oxygen affinity, and a normal Bohr effect. We postulate that the beta 129 proline substitution disrupts the H helix, perturbing nearby residues involved in alpha 1 beta 1 contact sites of the Hb tetramer."

Two children born on Crete of consanguinous parents presented the following manifestations of the ocular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS): blue sclerae, keratoglobus and rupture of cornea following minor trauma. In cultivated fibroblasts of one of the patients there was no evidence of defective lysine hydroxylation. The possible relation of our case to a recent similar report by Judisch et al. (1976) is discussed. The ocular type of EDS may be genetically heterogenous. Provisionally, we propose for cases with normal lysyl hydroxylation in vitro the term 'type VIII of EDS'.

Using ultrasonic A and B-mode equipment (Kreta-Technik, gray-scale) 80 time-position scans of active embryonal movements were recorded in 60 pregnancies between 8 and 14 weeks of amenorrhea. The quantitative analysis of the echograms comprised 14 parameters of embryonal motility. The extent and the velocity of body excursions within the amniotic cavity increased significantly with gestational age. Determinations of embryonal size by measurement of the thoracic diameter made possible an evaluation of energetic development in early pregnancy.

It is less rare than usually thought, but those afflicted frequently to to the physical specialties, whose treatment does not benefit them. It is important to recognize the illness, since there is tentative evidence that it may respond to treatment with pimozide.

"Polarcardiograms (PCG) derived from xyz leads of the Frank electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded in the supine position in 1264 initially healthy middle-aged Chinese men who had been under continuing medical surveillance and were re-examined seven years later. Polarcardiographic criteria for myocardial infarction (MI) were demonstrated in 97 men (7.7%), but only 15 of them showed diagnostic Q waves in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Polarcardiographic criteria for MI were independent of age, but ranged from 4.3% in 464 apparently normal men to 38% in 21 men with manifestations of ischemic heart disease. The possible association of polarcardiographic criteria and a history of smoking was limited to those with clinical evidence of heart disease. The ""false positive"" rate of 4.3% in clinically normal men was similar to that reported in younger Canadians and in Cretan population samples."

For brachytherapy the total dose was 24 to 32 Gy at a dose rate of 1.4 to 2.2 Gy per hour. Complication were correlated with total CRE values for point A (CRE TA) and for rectum CRE TR. Correlations of CRE TA with overall complication rate (p value &lt; 0.05) and rectal complication rate (p value &lt; 0.01) were excellent. Lack of correlation was observed between CRETR and overall complication rate (p value &gt; 0.1) as well as rectal complication rate (p value &gt; 0.1). In order to limit Grade II and III rectal and bladder complications to acceptable level, in combined external and intracavitary treatments, CRETA value of less than 2500 reu is suggested."

A tool for planning and assessment of primary health care. 	"Primary Health Care (PHC) in Crete is in a state of rapid development. The strategy for introducing PHC involves an orientation towards the population and the creation of possibilities for evaluation. A case records system, ""Egino"", was installed in the University of Heraklion and at the Health Centre in Spili in 1988, and was further developed according to local needs during 1989, when also a Greek version of the statistical system, ""DoIt"", was installed. The main reasons for establishing a computerized medical information system were (i) to assess the health needs in Crete, (ii) to monitor activities of the primary health care organizations, and (iii) to introduce epidemiological research into primary health care in Greece. The information system was based on specially assigned patient numbers containing several pieces of information about the individual; the system was developed at the Dalby Health Sciences Centre in Sweden. Each month, data were extracted in Spili Health Centre, and these data were regularly used to present incidence and prevalence indices. Some of the data extracted were reported to the health authorities in Greece. ""EginO"" and ""DoIt"" gave possibilities to evaluate health services by following the morbidity, while also making it possible to describe and analyse health needs in the population of Spili and other primary health care catchment areas in Greece."

"In Crete, 459 patients with a hip fracture were treated during 1986 and studied prospectively. The female/male and trochanteric/cervical fractures ratios were both 2. The majority of the patients (96 percent) were 50 years of age and over. The incidence was found to be 10 per 10,000 inhabitants for the whole population, whereas in the age group of 50 years and over, it was 30; and in the age group of 80 years and over, 140 per 10,000. From 1982 to 1986, the annual number of patients with a hip fracture increased by 20 percent, while the population 50 years and over remained practically unchanged. Compared with Scandinavia, the number of fractures in Crete is lower, and the proportion of trochanteric fractures is higher."

A cross-sectional study of men and women living in the village of Spili in Crete. 	"We have established a research project in primary health care in Crete with the aim of surveying the cardiovascular risk profile of a defined 'low-risk' population. The study population comprised all men and women aged 15-79 years in the village of Spili (n = 445); the overall attendance rate was 77% (greater than or equal to 82% in those aged 45 years and above). In this cross-sectional study we found a high (44%) prevalence of smoking in men aged 45-64 years as well as a high alcohol intake (48% drank greater than or equal to 210 g of pure alcohol every week). Furthermore, there was a high cholesterol level (6.2 mmol.l-1), and a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes. Against this background it is somewhat surprising that we did not find any signs of post-myocardial infarction in Spili men aged 63 and under. It is possible that positive factors, i.e. the closely knit social networks, the low unemployment rate, the hard water, and some of the dietary habits, e.g. the high consumption of olive oil, may counter-balance the negative factors mentioned above. It is also possible that the low risk factors in the past explain the low incidence of myocardial infarction today, and that this will change in the years to come."

A retrospective analysis of 291 patients with cancer of the uterine cervix treated with a combination of external and intracavitary radiotherapy was carried out. Patients were treated with an external radiotherapy dose of 45 Gy in 20 fractions, 5 fractions per week, or 42 Gy in 14 fractions, 3 fractions per week. For brachytherapy the total dose was 24 to 32 Gy at a dose rate of 1.4 to 2.2 Gy per hour. Treatment results in terms of survival, local disease-free survival and complication rates were compared with cumulative radiation effect (CRE) and extrapolated response dose (ERD) values for point A (CRETA and ERDTA respectively) and for rectum (CRETr and ERDTr respectively). CRETA and ERDTA values did not significantly correlate with local disease-free and survival rates. Correlations of CRETA and ERDTA with overall complication rate and with rectal complication rate (p-value less than 0.025) were good. No significant correlation was observed between CRETr or ERDTr and overall complication rate and rectal complication rate. In order to limit grades II and III rectal complications to acceptable level, in combined external and intracavitary treatment, CRETA and ERDTA values of less than 2,500 and 93 respectively are suggested.

"We have studied hypertension, obesity, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia in those aged 45-79 years in the Cretan low risk population of Spili (n = 249; attendance 82%) to see if these conditions interacted in the same way as previously described for high risk populations. Hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolaemia were found to be at least as prevalent in Spili as in Sweden. Furthermore, the previously described 'Metabolic Syndrome X', with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia as a common denominator also seemed to exist in the Spili population where patients with these conditions had higher insulin and C-peptide levels than normals. Our finding should be viewed against the low prevalence of past myocardial infarction in Cretan men from Spili reported by us and confirming the results of the Seven Countries Study."

An educational intervention program for the prevention of cardiovascular disease among 171 Cretan school students (13- and 14-year-olds) is assessed. Three schools from the province of Agios Vassilios acted as the intervention group while two schools from a neighboring province (Amari) formed the control group. Variables measured included: systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index, triceps skinfold thickness, serum total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and smoking habits. The intervention, based upon social learning theory, consisted of 10 sessions of theoretical and practical instruction on health issues in the classroom, supplemented with discussion, in the classroom, of the issues raised by different sessions. At the end of 1 academic year of intervention the results showed, after adjusting for age, sex, baseline value, height, and weight, an increase in total serum cholesterol of 0.70 mg/dl in the intervention group and 17.91 mg/dl in the control group (P less than 0.0001). Diastolic blood pressure (fourth phase) decreased by 2.95 mm Hg in the intervention group and by 0.48 mm Hg in the control group (P less than 0.05). Similar changes were observed in the body mass index (P less than 0.05). The proportion of school children starting smoking was significantly lower in the intervention group (6%) than in the control (20%) (P less than 0.01). The results indicate that this health education program in schools is effective in decreasing some of the major CVD risk factors. The long-term effect remains to be evaluated.

A computerized medical record system was introduced in Greek primary health care (PHC) in the village of Spili in Crete. The present study was carried out to study similarities and differences in the pattern of PHC use in Dalby Health Centre, Sweden (DHC), and Spili Health Centre, Greece (SHC). In both Dalby and Spili more than half the population contacted their respective health centre during 1989. Patients contacted DHC more often than SHC, 3.33 vs 2.30 times. Relatively more females than males used the health services in Dalby (64% vs 50%) but not in Spili (57% vs 55%). More visits were made by appointment at DHC than SHC (36.0% vs 12.6%). There were great similarities in the two areas in the ten most common diagnoses, analysed in four age-groups. In both areas, acute upper respiratory infections dominated in the youngest age-groups, and hypertension and diabetes in those aged 45 years and above.
PMID:1800198	Fioretos M, Scherstén B	Fam Pract. 8(4):347-9	1991	Establishment of research in primary health care in Greece. Experiences of Greek-Swedish collaboration. 	The last few decades have seen great changes in health care and medical care in Greece, as well as in the Greek university system. A new law on health care and medical care has come into force, a new university hospital and new health centres have been built, and a faculty of medicine has been established at Heraklion in Crete. People are speaking of a change of paradigm. Simultaneous with the introduction of the new national health care system, the Department of Family and Social Medicine (DFSM) in Crete started a major project on public health, known as the Primary Health Care and Nutrition Programs (abbreviated as PPD). The purpose was to chart the state of health and living conditions of the Cretan population in the period 1986-1990. Cooperation in research and training began between DFSM and the Dalby Health Sciences Centre, Lund University in 1987. This was natural since there was a shared interest in research into family medicine and social medicine. In addition, a new Health Care Act had come into force in Sweden in 1982. The establishment phase of primary health care started in Sweden at the end of the 1960s. In the 1970s health centres were established, along with research and training in family medicine, in a way that is comparable in many respects to the situation in which Crete found itself a decade later. This paper concerns the organization and implementation of PPD and the research cooperation between Greek and Swedish institutions. This can be seen as an expression of the internationalization of research for which the two universities have striven.
PMID:1802189	Labadarios D, Kafatos A	Nutrition. 7(1):61-3	1991	Teaching of clinical nutrition at the University of Crete, School of Medicine, Greece. 	The prevalence of malnutrition in hospitalized patients is reported to be unacceptably high, and lack of nutrition awareness among physicians/surgeons and medical students is considered an important contributory factor. We report our experience with the recently instituted clinical nutrition course at the medical school of the University of Crete, Greece. The course was designed with a bias in favor of the clinical application of nutrition at the patient and community level rather than in the format of formalized lectures. The students' answers to a questionnaire regarding the course indicated that 90% enjoyed it in terms of learning, 97% benefited from it, and 79% would like to see it adopted as the mode of teaching in the future. It is suggested that, in keeping with emerging evidence, such courses may have an important role in the teaching, application, and increased awareness of nutrition among medical students and practicing physicians.

"The traditional Cretan diet has been associated with low coronary-heart-disease (CHD) mortality rates. This study reports on the prevalence of CHD risk factors among 387 Cretan bank employees. Mean cholesterol concentration has risen by 36% over 26-y; dietary intake has changed: consumption of meat, fish, and cheese has increased and consumption of bread, fruit, and potatoes has decreased. Although the percentage contribution of fat to total energy intake has decreased from 40% to 36%, there has been a reduction in monounsaturated fatty acid consumption and an increase in the consumption of saturated fatty acids whereas the consumption of polyunsaturates has not been altered. Exception for diminished physical activity, the prevalence of other risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, and body mass index) remained relatively stable over this period. These changes in the CHD risk-factor status of the Cretan urban population occurred over a period in which CHD mortality rates are reported to have increased."

Current concepts with regard to the social integration of the thalassemia patient worldwide require further evaluation. In this work we have investigated the concepts of the average citizen of continental Greece and Crete about the problem of thalassemia, his awareness of the basic characteristics of the disease and his attitudes towards some 'life-style' parameters of the thalassemic sufferer. We used the method of stratified random sampling and interviewed 3500 people aged 15-65 years. We carried out multivariate statistical analysis of responses to the items on thalassemia in relation to sex, age, educational level, place of residence and marital status. The results of this survey show that education was the factor with the greatest influence on the likelihood of being aware of thalassemia and of having accurate knowledge of the basic features of the disease. There was also a general effect of age with the highest awareness and the best knowledge being found in those aged 21-44 years, while place of residence was a significant factor for two items. The features known best were that thalassemia is non-infectious, that it calls for blood transfusion, and is inherited. Education had the strongest influence on the probability that a person holds the attitude that the sufferer from thalassemia can play a normal role in society as regards working and having a family, as well as generally living a normal life and, in the case of thalassemic children, playing and going to school. The attitude that thalassemics should work instead of receiving a state benefit depended on education, age and place of residence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The seroprevalence of HIV-2 was evaluated in 20,407 consecutive normal blood donors, 100 homo- and/or bisexuals, and 7,020 heterosexuals presenting for an HIV test using an EIA test. Sixty-seven sera were revealed to be repeatedly positive. Analysis by Western blot confirmed the infection in four cases, an indeterminate (antibodies against only the gag-encoded proteins) pattern was revealed in 25 cases, whereas 38 sera were negative. Three of the four HIV-2-positive sera also reacted with two distinct, but close, synthetic peptides homologous to viral gp36. The fourth serum, which did not display antibodies against gp36 on Western blot, did not react with gp36-derived synthetic peptides. None of these sera reacted with native HIV-1 antigens or synthetic peptides homologous to gp41. Sera with an indeterminate HIV-2 Western blot did not react with gp36-derived synthetic peptides. Although 10 of them also displayed an indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot, no serum sample reacted with two gp41-derived synthetic peptides or proved to be positive when they tested for p24 antigen. One bisexual and one heterosexual HIV-2 positive subject reported sexual contacts with West Africans, whereas two other heterosexuals had had multiple sexual partners from different countries.

PMID:2557203	Mensink RP, Katan MB	Eur J Clin Nutr. 43 Suppl 2:43-8	1989	An epidemiological and an experimental study on the effect of olive oil on total serum and HDL cholesterol in healthy volunteers. 	We have studied the effects of olive oil on serum lipids in a dietary experiment with 48 healthy adult Dutch volunteers and in 76 boys 8-10 years of age from rural Crete. The dietary trial was carried out with normolipidaemic subjects, and it compared the effects of an olive-oil-rich and a carbohydrate-rich, high-fibre diet on serum lipids. Replacement of 12% of energy (en%) from saturated fatty acids by either monounsaturates or complex carbohydrates caused the same fall in serum total cholesterol of 0.45 mmol 1(-1). HDL cholesterol levels fell by 0.19 mmol 1(-1) on the carbohydrate-rich diet, but remained virtually unchanged on the olive-oil-rich diet. This was in agreement with our hypothesis that the total amount of fat in the diet is a determinant of HDL cholesterol. The diet of the Cretan boys contained 10 en% saturated fat, but 27 en% monounsaturated fat due to the liberal use of olive oil. Serum-lipid levels of the Cretan boys were not different from those of their counterparts from western European Countries. The mean body mass index of the Cretan boys was about 2 kg m-2 higher than those of boys in the other countries, which might have confounded comparisons. Whatever the explanation, the present-day lifestyle and diet in Crete do not produce a particularly favourable HDL to LDL cholesterol ratio in the blood, even though olive oil intake is high.

B) The average menarcheal age is higher for the students whose birth weight was less than 2.500 gr. C) The higher the father's educational level results in lower average menarcheal age and higher I.Q. level for the student. D) Comparing the average menarcheal ages of mothers and their daughters we conclude that the daughters had their menstruation 11.5 months earlier than their mothers, while that difference was 11 months in Thrace.

A high intake of olive oil has produced high levels of high-density and low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in short-term dietary trials. To investigate long-term effects of olive oil we have studied the diet and serum lipids of boys in Crete, where a high olive oil consumption is the norm. Seventy-six healthy rural Cretan boys aged 7-9 years were studied. The diet was assessed by a 2-day dietary recall. Blood was collected according to a standardized protocol and sera were analyzed in a rigidly standardized laboratory. The mean daily intake of energy was 11.0 MJ (2629 kcal). The intake of fat (45.0% of energy) and oleic acid (27.2% of energy) was high, and that of saturated fat low (10.0% of energy), reflecting a high consumption of olive oil. The high consumption of olive oil was confirmed by a high proportion of oleic-acid (27.1%) in serum cholesteryl fatty acids. Mean concentration of serum total cholesterol was 4.42 mmol l-1 (171 mg dl-1), of HDL-cholesterol 1.40 mmol l-1 (54 mg dl-1), of serum triglycerides 0.59 mmol l-1 (52 mg dl-1), of apo-AI 1210 mg l-1 and of LDL apo-B 798 mg l-1. The body mass index of the Cretan boys (18.2 kg m-2) was on average 2 kg m-2 higher than that of boys from other countries. Contrary to our expectation, the Cretan boys did not show a more favourable serum lipoprotein pattern than boys from more westernized countries studied previously using the same protocol. Our hypothesis that a typical, olive-oil-rich Cretan diet causes a relatively high HDL- to total cholesterol ratio is not supported by the present findings.

Risk factors for coronary heart disease were studied in healthy middle-aged Cretan men in order to compare them with the middle-aged men of a previous generation studied in 1960 as the Cretan cohort of the Seven Countries Study (1960). In the present cohort mean values for total cholesterol were 5.48 mmol/L, for HDL-cholesterol 1.26 mmol/L, for triglycerides 1.41 mmol/L, for systolic blood pressure 128 mmHg, and for diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Serum cholesterol was higher and blood pressure slightly lower than the values observed in 1960. However, it is uncertain whether these changes were real or caused by changes in methodology. The mean body mass index has increased from 22.6 in 1960 to 26.9 kg/m2 in 1982, due to an increase in fatness. The percentage of smokers had increased from 57.4% to 74.1%. Upon multiple regression analysis the body mass index, the subscapular to triceps skinfold ratio and smoking were negatively and independently related with HDL-cholesterol. Body mass index correlated positively with serum triglycerides. Although the incidence of coronary heart disease is still low in Crete, it is concluded that there is nothing in the risk profile of these middle-aged men to suggest that they are at a low risk for coronary heart disease.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania infantum may have occurred in Crete in the 18th century. Artificial transmission was effected in Algeria and Aleppo in the 18th century.

Andrade's disease, which is a type of familial amyloidosis, is not common in Greece and seems to be restricted to the region of Heraklion, Crete. The authors describe a case of Andrade's disease which began with ocular symptoms when the patient was 29. After two years the full clinical picture of the disease developed. The ocular symptoms are often the first manifestations of this fatal disease. The paper includes the family tree of the patient, proving the hereditary origin of the disease.
PMID:3684969	Khong TY, Robertson WB	Placenta. 8(4):399-409	1987	Placenta creta and placenta praevia creta. 	The placental bed in placenta creta and placenta praevia creta was studied from pregnancy or immediate postpartum hysterectomy specimens. In all cases placental villi were seen in direct contact with myometrium, the sine qua non of placenta creta, but was focal in some cases. There was no apparent diminution of decidua parietalis or, in cases of focal accreta, of adjacent basalis. In all cases the extravillous trophoblast was mainly uninuclear or binuclear, in contrast to the placental bed syncytial giant cells seen in late normal placentation. There was an apparent proliferation of interstitial trophoblast at the junction of placenta with myometrium, but the density of interstitial trophoblast deeper in the myometrium was lower than it is in normal placentation. An unusual uteroplacental vasculature was seen in which physiological changes were present in large arteries of the radial/arcuate system deep in the myometrium, while there were also spiral arteries more superficially without physiological changes. These findings suggest that in placenta creta there is defective interaction between maternal tissues, particularly decidua, and migratory trophoblast in the early stages of placentation resulting in undue adherence of the placenta or penetration into the uterus coupled with the development of an abnormal uteroplacental circulation.

Blood pressures (BP) were determined in 1409 boys aged 8-16 years at three one-year intervals in New York City (NYC) and in Greece, areas of high and low incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), respectively. Non-Greek American boys had significantly lower systolic and diastolic BP than all the Greek boys from NYC and from Greece. The boys residing in Crete and in Athens had higher BP than all other cohorts. After covariance adjustment for height, ponderal index and age, significant differences among the cohorts showed the non-Greek American cohort to have the lowest and the Cretan cohorts the highest BP levels. The Cretans lead a lifestyle noted for the absence of other risk factors for CHD. Thus, while the incremental increase in blood pressure might have a corresponding increase in CHD risk among individuals, there are fewer individuals in Crete at elevated risk overall based on the CHD experience of the U.S. and Greece.

Sixty symptomatic and 42 asymptomatic cases of hepatitis A detected during two epidemics on the Greek island of Crete in autumn-winter, 1978-1979 were tested for serum total and immunoglobulin M (IgM) specific antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV and IgM anti-HAV) by commercially available solid phase radioimmunoassays. All cases of symptomatic hepatitis A tested during the first eight weeks from onset were IgM anti-HAV positive with a geometric mean titer of 1:3,575 at 0-28 days from onset. The probability of positivity declined progressively thereafter: a 50% level was reached on the 128th day from onset and the geometric mean titer dropped to 1:317 in samples obtained after the 85th day from onset. Asymptomatic patients had a significantly shorter duration of IgM response than symptomatic ones and three months from onset the prevalence of IgM anti-HAV was only 33% in the former compared to 95% in the latter (p less than 0.0001). A significantly higher prevalence of IgM anti-HAV and higher titers of total and IgM specific anti-HAV was observed in females than in males. IgM anti-HAV was positive in 12 (57%) of 21 samples from females compared to three (12.5%) of 24 samples from males, collected after the 85th day from onset (p less than 0.01). Five months from onset, the cumulative probability of IgM anti-HAV positivity in females was 38% compared to 0% in males (p less than 0.05).

"According to calculations made by the well-known hygienist Max Rubner in 1890, the annual quantity of waste made up of excreta, urine, kitchen refuse, ashes and water for general use than ran to 7,300 kgs. Thus it appears quite obvious that as early as in the ancient high cultures special waste disposal plants existed. In the Old Testament cesspools were in use, in Ancient Egypt sliding boxes served the same purpose, the Cretan palace of Knossos was provided with a really sophisticated water closet system and there is evidence that a similar facility existed in Mesopotamia. The Roman Cloaca maxima which functioned as a sanitary system for the entire capital, has never ceased to impress. With the advent of the so-called ""miasma theory"", public health legislations also started to take care of waste disposal, and as a result, various lavatories, slaughter-house and waste water facilities were created. When bacteriology began to establish itself, close attention was devoted to the ground water and the rivers. The ""squatting closet"" in Roman countries contrasted with the flush closet in England. For waste disposal, the so-called ""Heidelberg barrel system"" or the ""Kiel exchange bucket system"" were introduced. Of more recent date are the digestion chambers, the flow settling tanks and the ""trickling or oxydation system"" on the sprinkling fields."

Forced vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume at 0.75 s (FEV) were measured in 592 Cretan island men aged 25 to 74 in 1960, 1965, and 1970. Vital capacity and FEV were directly correlated with height, but percentage changes were unrelated to height. A prominent accelerating decrease with age was also observed, the longitudinal decrement becoming more marked with advancing age. Chronic obstructive lung disease at entry significantly accelerated the loss of lung capacity, more so for emphysema than for chronic bronchitis. Among heavier men, body weight gains intensified the age-dependent loss of vital capacity and FEV. Borderline statistically significant differences in FEV decreases (adjusted for age, height and entry FEV) were seen between cigarette smoking groups. Heavy smokers had more diagnoses of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Modifiable factors in minimizing the decrease of lung capacity with age include obesity, obstructive lung disease, and smoking, the last through development of chronic obstructive lung disease.

The main conclusion from this experimental work is that the new, hidden, heat sensitive polymorphism does not belong solely to the tested locus, but is the result of interaction between the enzymatic products of different loci. The evidence for this is (1) that nonrepeatable heat-sensitive phenotypes within some tested strains exist, (2) The heat-sensitive phenotypes in F1 crosses did not give one pattern in most of the tested cases, and (3) in single testcrosses using null strains and single fly analysis, we did not observe one-locus Mendelian segregation within the offspring."

A retrospective study was undertaken in Crete, Greece, to investigate the epidemiologic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of Q fever. Over a period of 5 years (1989-1993), 1,298 patients were examined and 98 cases were identified. Individuals who were aged 20-29 years and 30-39 years appeared to have an increased risk of infection. Contact with animals was found to be a major risk factor for acquisition of Q fever. The predominant clinical manifestations of the infection were fever (91.7% of patients) and respiratory disease (88.5%), whereas hepatitis was the dominant feature in only a minority (7.1%) of patients. Chest radiographs frequently revealed pulmonary interstitial changes (36.4% of patients) and alveolar changes (34.4%). Abnormal echocardiographic findings were also observed. There was no difference in the duration of fever whether the patient received therapy with tetracycline or erythromycin, a finding that may be explained by the delay in initiating tetracycline therapy.

"As a result of the Seven Countries Study, the Mediterranean diet has been popularized as a healthy diet. Nevertheless, it has not replaced the prudent diet commonly prescribed to coronary patients. Recently, we completed a secondary, randomized, prospective prevention trial in 605 patients recovering from myocardial infarction in which we compared an adaptation of the Cretan Mediterranean diet with the usual prescribed diet. After a mean follow-up period of 27 mo, recurrent myocardial infarction, all cardiovascular events, and cardiac and total death were significantly decreased by &gt; 70% in the group consuming the Mediterranean diet. These protective effects were not related to serum concentrations of total, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL), or high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. In contrast, protective effects were related to changes observed in plasma fatty acids: an increase in n-3 fatty acids and oleic acid and a decrease in linoleic acid that resulted from higher intakes of linolenic and oleic acids, but lower intakes of saturated fatty acids and linoleic acid. In addition, higher plasma concentrations of antioxidant vitamins C and E were observed. We conclude that a Cretan Mediterranean diet adapted to a Western population protected against coronary heart disease much more efficiently than did the prudent diet. Thus, it appears that the favorable life expectancy of the Cretans could be largely due to their diet."

"We present a food pyramid that reflects Mediterranean dietary traditions, which historically have been associated with good health. This Mediterranean diet pyramid is based on food patterns typical of Crete, much of the rest of Greece, and southern Italy in the early 1960s, where adult life expectancy was among the highest in the world and rates of coronary heart disease, certain cancers, and other diet-related chronic diseases were among the lowest. Work in the field or kitchen resulted in a lifestyle that included regular physical activity and was associated with low rates of obesity. The diet is characterized by abundant plant foods (fruit, vegetables, breads, other forms of cereals, potatoes, beans, nuts, and seeds), fresh fruit as the typical daily dessert, olive oil as the principal source of fat, dairy products (principally cheese and yogurt), and fish and poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts, zero to four eggs consumed weekly, red meat consumed in low amounts, and wine consumed in low to moderate amounts, normally with meals. This diet is low in saturated fat (&lt; or = 7-8% of energy), with total fat ranging from &lt; 25% to &gt; 35% of energy throughout the region. The pyramid describes a dietary pattern that is attractive for its famous palatability as well as for its health benefits."

We assessed the incidence of hip fracture and ecological correlates in residents of 14 communities in six countries of Southern Europe. Hip fracture cases were recorded prospectively in defined catchment areas over a 1-year interval. A retrospective questionnaire was used to assess ecological differences between communities. During a 1-year period of observation a total of 3629 men and women over the age of 50 years were identified with hip fracture from a catchment of 3 million. In all communities the fracture rate increased exponentially with age. There were large and significant differences between centres in the doubling time for hip fracture risk with age and in crude and age-standardized rates. Greater than 4-fold and 13-fold differences in age-standardized risk were found amongst men and women respectively. The lowest rates were observed from Turkey and the highest from Seville, Crete and Porto. Fractures were significantly more frequent among women than men with the exception of three rural Turkish centres. Indeed, in rural Turkey the normal female/male ratio was reserved. Variations in incidence between regions were greater than the differences within centres between sexes, and there was a close and significant correlation between incidence rates for men and those for women in the regions studied. Excess female morbidity increased progressively from the age of 50 years but attained a plateau after the age of 80 years, suggesting a finite duration of the effect of the menopause. The retrospective questionnaire completed by 80% of cases suggested that differences in incidence between the communities studied could not be explained by differences in gonadal status in women. In both men and women cross-cultural associations were found with factors related to age or socioeconomic prosperity, the majority of which disappeared after adjustment for age. We conclude that there are marked and sizeable differences in the incidence rates of hip fracture throughout Southern Europe. The reasons for these differences are not known but affect both men and women, and are likely to be related to lifestyle or genetic factors rather than to differences in endocrine status.

The differences observed concern mainly the frequency of cancers of the lung, prostate, bladder and large bowel among men and breast and large bowel among women. These findings could to a great extent be explained by life-style and environmental differences between the two areas and are consistent with data concerning the cancer mortality in the two countries. 
PMID:7979164	Heyden S	Ann Nutr Metab. 38(3):117-22	1994	Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the diet to prevent coronary heart disease via cholesterol reduction. 	For over 30 years the American Heart Association recommended to limit the fat intake to 30 energy % (E%) of total calories with 10 E% derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), 10 E% from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and 10 E% from saturated fatty acids (SFA). In 1988 and subsequent years, the National Cholesterol Education Program has changed this advise in favor of an increase of 15 E% MUFA and a reduction to 5 E% PUFA. This dramatic change was based largely on short-term dietary experiments, with formula diets with small numbers of subjects, and anecdotal epidemiological evidence from the population of Crete. The assertion that oleic acid may lower cholesterol and LDL remains unproven. However, isocaloric substitution of linoleic acid for oleic acid lowers cholesterol and LDL. Oleic acid has little or no effect on lipids and lipoproteins except as it replaces SFA. Large dietary feeding experiments in the 1950s and 1960s with persons with hypercholesterolemia and with patients after myocardial infarction were conducted with PUFA-enriched diets and proved effective in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. No such studies exist with MUFA-enriched diets. Therefore, the original recommendations remain the standard of dietary advise to healthy persons and patients after myocardial infarction.

Adipose tissue samples were collected by aspiration and data concerning general health habits were obtained. Food intake was estimated by a 24-hour dietary recall, while Type A profile was assessed with a Greek translation of the Bortner scale. Factors associated with Type A profile are adipose tissue linoleic acid (p &lt; 0.0004), annual income (p &lt; 0.001), total serum cholesterol (p &lt; 0.009), and adipose fat myristoleic acid (p &lt; 0.02).

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure), after which the remnant of the pancreatic duct was not anastomosed to the jejunum but drained externally through a soft polyethylene tube. All patients received total enteral or parenteral nutrition, plus somatostatin. Avoidance of the high morbidity associated with pancreaticoduodenectomy, in particular pancreatic fistula secondary to leakage from the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. There was no immediate postoperative mortality or morbidity. The output from the pancreatic remnant decreased progressively, and had ceased in all cases within 20 days; the tube was removed when drainage ceased. Median hospital stay was 24 days (range 20-28). Two patients died after 9 and 11 months, respectively, and the remainder were alive at a median of 26.5 months (range 7-38). Blood glucose concentrations remained within the reference range throughout. The technique of external drainage of the pancreatic remnant can safely be combined with a Whipple procedure, ameliorating the risk of postoperative complications and at the same time preserving pancreatic endocrine function."

Based on epidemiologic and environmental findings, it was concluded that the transmission of shigellosis was waterborne. Shigella were not isolated from water, but one of the three village springs was found to be contaminated with faecal coliforms. This spring was probably contaminated by sewage material, due to its proximity to a source of untreated sewage effluent. Implementation of environmental and control measures brought the epidemic to an end."

This study investigated the prevalence of ECG abnormalities in the population of five villages and compared the prevalence of hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia in those with and without ECG signs of IHD. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a group from 15 to 79 years of age (n = 1218); overall attendance was 926 (76%). Studies included case history, clinical status, laboratory variables, and 12-lead ECG. Technically acceptable ECGs were read and coded blindly for 895 subjects (97%). Minnesota codes suggesting ""Probable IHD"" were recorded in 3.3% of the women and 3.5% of the men from 45 to 79 years of age. Hypertension was more common in subjects with than in those without ""Probable IHD."" This also tended to be the case for diabetes. Cholesterol and body mass index were relatively high in both groups. The present prevalence of ""Probable IHD"" in Cretans appears to be very similar to that observed in other population surveys. Also, the contemporary cardiovascular risk factor profile in the population was quite unfavorable, with a relatively high prevalence of smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. The prevalence of ""Probable IHD"" was lowest in the village where the health center was situated (1% vs 4.5%), and this difference was also reflected in differences among the villages of some important risk factors for IHD as well as in the way patients with hypertension and other diseases were cared for. Thus, it seems IHD is becoming more prevalent in the ""low risk"" population of Crete. This may very well be a result of a more unfavorable lifestyle and a higher rate of risk factors than before."

The percentage of smokers and the average body mass index did not differ between the Cretan and Zutphen men, but the percentage of severely overweight men was three times higher in the Cretan cohort. Among men in Zutphen the oleic acid content of the cholesteryl esters was positively associated with the HDL cholesterol level, independent of the effects of age, body mass index, cigarette smoking and alcohol intake. However, the difference in HDL cholesterol level between Zutphen and Crete could be explained to only a minor extent by differences in serum cholesteryl oleic acid, smoking, or obesity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

"In order to identify socioeconomic factors affecting parents' alcohol and cigarette consumption and father's aggressiveness toward other family members, 87 low-income and 92 medium-income Greek families were tested. Father's alcohol consumption correlated positively with his smoking (p &lt; .0008) and aggressive behavior (p &lt; .00005), while mother's alcohol correlated positively with her smoking (p &lt; .0001) and number of marriages (p &lt; .01), and negatively with the family's overcrowding index (p &lt; .006). Furthermore, father's smoking correlated positively with his alcohol (p &lt; .01), and mother's smoking with her alcohol (p &lt; .0004) and tenancy (p &lt; .01). Finally, father's aggressiveness was found to be positively related to his alcohol consumption and negatively to his work and level of education."

"We have compared the use of primary health care and the diagnoses at visits to doctors in the Spili Health Centre (SHC) in Crete and the Dalby Health Centre (DHC) in Sweden. In DHC more patients per 1000 population visited the doctors than in SHC. This was so regardless of age-group and sex, in fact more or less regardless of diagnosis. Other differences between the populations were: The diagnosis acute otitis media was more frequent in the Dalby children than in the Spili ones. The opposite was true of ""head injuries"" which were more frequent in the Spili boys. Visits to doctors for bronchitis was more frequent in the Spili men, maybe because of the extensive smoking habits of Cretan men. Visits for diseases of the musculoskeletal system were more frequent in DHC than in SHC. A hypothesis worth testing is that this was influenced by differences in the health insurance and sick benefit systems. Angina pectoris was fairly frequent in both areas but cardiosclerosis (including healed myocardial infarction) was more common in DHC than in SHC. Use of primary health care may be influenced by the need for health care in the population, the accessibility of the health care facilities, the costs for the patients, the quality of care as perceived by the patients and by other sociocultural factors. Comparative studies, even though fairly uncommon today, may be of use in generating hypotheses about the impact of different factors on the use of health care."

"This study compares the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD), risk factors (RF), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among Cretan men from a rural area examined in 1960 and 1991. The study population consisted of 148 men in 1960 and 42 men in 1991 of the same age group (fifty-five to fifty-nine years old) and from the same rural area. All men had a complete examination of the cardiovascular system and a resting electrocardiogram (ECG). Systolic BP (SBP) &gt; or = 140 mmHg was found in 42.6% of the subjects in 1960 and in 45.2% in 1991 (NS). Diastolic BP &gt; or = 95 mmHG was found in 14.9% of the subjects in 1960 as opposed to 33.3% in 1991 (P &lt; 0.02). Total serum cholesterol (TSCH) &gt; or = 260 mg/dL approximately 6.7 mmol/L) was found in 12.8% of the subjects in 1960 and in 28.6% in 1991 (P &lt; 0.01). Heavy smokers ( &gt; or = 20 cigarettes/daily) were 27.0% in 1960 as compared with 35.7% in 1991 (:NS); 5.4% of the subjects in 1960 had light physical activity (PA) as compared with 14.3% in 1991 (P &lt; 0.01); 74.7% of the subjects were farmers in 1960 as compared with 43.6% in 1991 (P &lt; 0.1). The prevalence of CHD was 0.7% in 1960 as compared with 9.5% in 1991 (P &lt; 0.001). Hypertensive heart disease was found in 3.4% of the subjects in 1960 and 4.8% in 1991 (NS). The prevalence of all major CVD was much higher in 1991 (19.1%) as compared with 1960 (8.8%) (P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, the prevalence of CHD RF and CVD was much higher in 1991 than in 1960 for Cretan men of the same age group. This higher prevalence seems to be related to dietary and life-style changes that have taken place in Crete during the last thirty years."

The serum conversion incidence of each infectious agent was determined by testing 2 blood samples, collected in 1985 and in 1987. The surveillance was conducted using detailed transparent maps of the 2 villages studied, on which epidemiological data were interrelated to the results obtained from the serological tests. Thus the importance and spread of each infection were visualized. C. burnetii, Toxoplasma sp., R. conorii, and E. granulosus, were the most common infectious agents encountered during this study.

In Crete, in southern Greece, a number of fatal carbamate poisonings were investigated over a period of 2 years, from 1991 to 1993. Five cases are reported, involving the fatal ingestion of methomyl (Lannate), a cholinesterase-inhibiting carbamate insecticide. Analysis of samples of blood plasma and serum showed more than 90% inhibition of cholinesterase. The blood methomyl concentrations had a mean value of 26.7 mg/l, and a range of 5.6-57.0 mg/l. These values are much higher than those previously reporter in similar cases (0.57-1.4 mg/l). Methomyl concentrations in organs and tissues were found to be significantly lower than those in blood and vitreous humour.

Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant disorder of mid-life onset characterized by chorea, dementia, and oculomotor disturbances. Anticipation is commonly seen in HD families, particularly when the disease is inherited through the father. The disorder is associated with an expanded (CAG)n repeat in the IT15 gene that is unstable and tends to increase in size during meiotic transmissions, particularly of paternal origin. We have detected an unusual form of HD on the island of Crete which has distinctly different characteristics. Data from eight families encompassing 48 HD patients, showed a median age at onset 15-20 years later than that for HD occurring worldwide. There is no juvenile cases and no anticipation. DNA analysis in 12 HD patients showed expansion of the (CAG)n repeat the size of which was identical among members of each family or varied by only one unit. The elongated DNA segment was passed stably or contracted during both paternal and maternal transmissions thus indicating that unique molecular mechanisms may be operational in this form of HD.

"Diabetes mellitus is a common disease in developed countries, but in Greece national figures on its prevalence are lacking. The aim of this study was to identify the burden of known diabetes mellitus through its estimation in the area of responsibility of the Spili Health Centre, based on the health information system that had been established in Primary Health Care in rural Crete. The diagnosis of diabetes was retrospectively documented by reviewing all medical records (n = 47151) at the Spili Health Centre and its five regional outposts during the period 1/6/1988-1/7/1993. The diagnostic criteria of WHO were used to establish the diagnosis. After excluding the patients who had died, we found 210 patients with diabetes mellitus. Thirty cases were evaluated with OGTT because of mild but not diagnostic elevations of fasting plasma glucose, on more than one occasion. The prevalence of diabetes after age and sex standardization of that for the European population was estimated at 1.52% (1.31% in males and 1.68 in females). Our study shows that: 1) the role of the GPs and one appropriate information system in measuring the prevalence of known diabetes mellitus are now considered important within the Greek context; 2) diabetes mellitus seems not to be a rare disease in rural Crete. The estimated prevalence appears to be similar to the prevalence rates reported in other areas of rural Greece."

Nine human acute poisonings due to intentional ingestion of organophosphorous pesticides are presented. Six of the victims died. Six patients were treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from 34 h to 45 d, while 3 were found dead by relatives. Two of the patients treated in the ICU fully recovered after 15 and 24 d while the third survivor developed delayed neuropathy. Organophosphate blood levels were determined on admission and during therapy, and in 1 case atropine and pralidoxime levels were also detected. Significant fluctuations of the plasma cholinesterase activity were observed during therapy. Postmortem analysis revealed higher levels of pesticides in organs (eg 23.1 micrograms fenthion/g kidney) and in fat (135.2 micrograms fenthion/g) than in blood (eg 4.8 micrograms fenthion/ml) and vitreous humor. Considerable pesticide was measured in testis (eg 5.8 micrograms fenthion/g, 0.8 micrograms methidathion/g) and uterus (170.5 micrograms malathion/g). Extracorporeal decontamination to enhance pesticide elimination is a therapeutic challenge.
PMID:8693685	Tsatsakis AM, Perakis K, Koumantakis E	Vet Hum Toxicol. 38(2):113-7	1996	Experience with acute paraquat poisoning in Crete. 	Ten cases of acute paraquat poisonings with lethal (n = 5) and non-lethal (n = 5) outcomes are presented. Paraquat plasma and urine levels of the patients on admission (from 2 to 41 h after ingestion) at the peripheral hospitals varied from 0.4 to 6.0 and 0.5 to 12.8 micrograms/ml, respectively. Besides standard supportive treatment, hemoperfusion/hemodialysis and/or plasmapheresis were performed for therapy, which in 1 case lasted for 28 d. The pharmacokinetic data from patient paraquat elimination confirmed considerable paraquat rebound from tissues to blood circulation and marked the need for continued therapy even with undetectable paraquat plasma levels. Postmortem analysis showed that while paraquat was mainly distributed in kidney (807 micrograms/g), lung (479 micrograms/g) and liver (206 micrograms/g), amounts were also detected in thyroid (64 micrograms/g), testis (21 micrograms/g), vitreous humor (45 micrograms/ml) and cerebrospinal fluid (7.4 micrograms/ml). Paraquat crossed the placenta and concentrated there to higher levels than in the mother's blood. The fetus seemed to tolerate the mother's paraquat intoxication while dependent on placental circulation.

Since the discovery of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations of Crete and Greek mainland, a systematic understanding has been gained of their material culture and social structures. Nevertheless, because of the absence of textual and pictorial evidence of medicine of the kind which exists in the contemporary societies of Egypt and the Near East, little work has been produced on the subject of disease and the practice of medicine in the period. However, new pathological evidence throws much light on this hitherto largely unknown aspect of their civilization.

Incidence over a 5-year period.	There has been an impression from published work that Crohn's disease is less common in southern than in northern Europe. A low incidence of Crohn's disease has been observed in Greece, but conclusive data are still lacking. A 5-year prospective and population-based epidemiologic study of Crohn's disease was carried out in a well-defined area of Crete. The mean annual incidence of the disease for the years 1990-94 was 3.0 per 10(5) inhabitants. During the study period the incidence increased from 1.9/10(5) in 1990 to 3.8/10(5) in 1994. The male to female ratio was 2.4:1. The age group 25-34 years had the highest age-adjusted incidence (6.3/10(5)). The incidence of Crohn's disease was also found to be higher in smokers, in urban areas, and in people with high educational level. Crohn's disease is common in Heraklion, Crete. The findings of the study are discussed in relation to those of other European countries.

The morphological comparison showed marked differences in the lengths of parts of the male genitalia, female pharynx, and spermathecae. The isoenzyme study revealed characteristic monomorphic phenotypes for glucose phosphate isomerase, hexokinase, and phosphoglucomutase in the Canarian specimens as compared with the Cretan population. These results confirm the heterogeneity of P. sergenti and indicate the utility of a systematic double approach for a revision of this taxon.

Vitamin E is a very important nutrient in the human diet mainly due to its antioxidant properties. In this study an attempt was made to measure and evaluate vitamin E intake and to determine plasma tocopherol levels in a group of adolescents in Spili, Crete, Greece. It is known that Crete is an area with a high consumption of olive oil. It has been shown in this study that the mean olive oil consumption of these adolescents was 70.7 +/- 15.4 g/day. Vitamin E intake was 11.7 +/- 2.3 mg/day and olive oil provided 67% of this intake. Furthermore the vitamin E/PUFA ratio in food intake was 1.5 mg/g a value higher than reported by other investigators for populations with a high consumption of seed oils. The mean serum a-tocopherol levels in the selected 12 adolescents was 0.79 mg/dl (range 0.7-1.02).

The aim of this study was to make a systematic registration of a group of 354 social care indigent patients in relation to: their pharmaceutical needs: the conditions for which it was prescribed, its cost, and details of prescriptions. In addition patients' eating patterns relating to and knowledge of how to use their medication was assessed. They were compared to a control group of 153 Social Security patients. The Social Care indigent patients were of low income, consisting of groups as unmarried mothers with their children and Greeks emigrants coming back home from other countries (Albania, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Romania etc.). The socio-demographic profiles of this group reveal an unemployment rate of 74% and an illiteracy rate of 18%. As regards marital status, 20% are bachelors and 12% divorcees. The results of the study indicated no significant difference between the two groups in the mean cost of prescription (40 ECU for Social Care patients vs 32 ECU for Social Security patients), in the mean number of medication per prescription (2.6 vs 2.6 respectively), in the percentages of the Daily Defined Doses and the cost of the various categories of drugs. For both groups, the most common drugs were those of the Cardiovascular system (30% vs 26%), Gastrointestinal system (17% vs 27%) and Nervous system (16% vs 18%). The most common diagnosis was Hypertension (10% vs 8%) and the most common drugs were Ranitidine (3% vs 2%), Diclofenac (3% vs 3%), Salbutamol (3% vs 3%) and Paracetamol (2% vs 2%). Significant differences between Social Care patients to Social Security patients respectively were found regarding: knowing how to take their medication correctly (47% vs 77%), knowing for how long treatment needed to be taken (21% vs 43%), requesting information from the pharmacist (39% vs 68%) knowledge of dietary instructions regarding medication (17% vs 41%) and in smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day (15% vs 3%). The results indicated that the Social Care patients, in comparison with the patients of the Social Security, need more education and more help in the area of the proper use of drugs and in the personal contact that this procedure involves.

This paper compares the learning performance of alternative ML systems with each other and with respect to a novel approach using logic minimization, called LML, to learn from data. Patient cases were taken from the archives of the Paediatric Surgery Clinic of the University Hospital of Crete, Heraklion, Greece. Comparison of ML system performance is based both on classification accuracy and on informal expert assessment of learned knowledge.

Operational flight surgeons are often responsible for determining aeromedical readiness of aircrew members whose accumulated flight time exceeds standard limitations. Realizing that operational reports of excessive flight time in aircrew are limited, we used Rayman's 1975 study of fatigue during Cambodian airlift missions as a model to evaluate 42 U.S. Navy EP-3E aircrew members flying reconnaissance missions from Souda Bay, Crete, Greece. Measured parameters focused on information accessible to operational flight surgeons. Hoping to identify early indices of fatigue, the aircrews were monitored using anonymous questionnaires, physiologic data (mean arterial pressure, pulse, pulse pressure), and hematologic measurements (CBC, sedimentation rate). As suspected, no physiologic parameter indicated early fatigue. However, some aircrew demonstrated small changes in measured visual phorias as compared to prior evaluations. Anonymous questionnaires and subjective evaluation of crewmembers appeared most valuable in assessing fatigue. Incorporating previously reported recommendations for fatigue surveillance, the Souda Bay experience is an example of successful fatigue monitoring in aircrews who accumulate flight time beyond standard restrictions.

A seroepidemiological study was carried out in a geographically well-defined area in rural Crete in order to determine the prevalence of A, B and C hepatitis markers in the local population. Serum samples were obtained from 257 subjects (94 males, 163 females), aged 15 years and over, who visited the primary health care services of the Spili Health Centre between July 1993 and March 1994, and from 164 subjects (83 males, 81 females) randomly selected from households in three neighbouring villages of the study area. In samples obtained from the Spili Health Centre, antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) were detected in 234/244 (95.9%) subjects, antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAb) were detected in 63/257 (24.5%) subjects and antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were detected in 28/257 (10.9%) subjects. The corresponding figures for those randomly selected from the villages were 135/154 (87.7%), 16/164 (9.8%) and 5/164 (3%) respectively. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was positive in three (1.2%) subjects from the first group, while none of those recruited from the villages were positive for HBsAg. Interestingly, hepatitis markers were closely associated with age. No subjects under the age of 15 years showed evidence of prior hepatitis A infection and approximately 20% of those between 15 and 44 years of age were also negative. By contrast, practically all subjects older than 44 years were anti-HAV positive. Similarly, the majority of all those who were anti-HCV positive were older subjects. Seroepidemiology of hepatitis in this well-defined population seems to be different from other parts of Greece, at least for hepatitis B and C viruses. There is a very low prevalence of HBsAg and a very high incidence of anti-HCV. Low exposure to HAV, as found in other parts of the country, was also found in the younger generation in this rural area of Crete.

Vaginal culture, cytology, and vaginoscopy. Vulvovaginitis was encountered in 61.8% of the gynecological problems seen during childhood and adolescence. Infections were usually located in both the vulva and the vagina (56.9%). The main symptoms were vaginal discharge (53%), erythema (33%), and pruritus (27%). Candida spp (23.0%), beta-hemolytic Streptococci group B (15.0%), and Enterococci spp (10.0%) were the most frequent pathogens involved in the disease. Vulvovaginitis is a common disease during childhood and adolescence. Effective treatment, reassurance, and appropriate consultation based on the prevention of relapses are the most important steps for the management of the disease.

The female gender.	Modern health system research emphasises the transition from mortality statistics via morbidity and risk factors observations to comparative site explorations in defined areas. The health of women from the perspective of their gender has become a priority in medical research over the last decade. Studies of morbidity have been called for as necessary intermediary stage for hypothesis generation, and the formulation and inception of epidemiological projects which are recognized as essential for attaining knowledge on the factors and circumstances that determine diseases and wellbeing in the general population. This applies especially to cancer, where the importance of seeing disease, from a ecological, cultural as well as gender context is evident. We made a comparative analysis of the hospitalization for somatic diseases during 1986-1987 at the Heraklion University Hospital on Crete, and the commensurable Linköping University Hospital in the country of Ostergötland, Sweden. They are representative of their complementary Europian situations and comprise the total hospital admissions in their regions. Large differences were found, notably regarding both cardiovascular diseases and cancer, with lower morbidity in the more 'arcadian', rural circumstances. The results provide unique data on traits and patterns intermediate to the pioneering observations of the Seven Countries survey on the rapidly changing European scene. In the field of cancer the data are effectively unmatched both as raw data and as a platform for further investigation, which we are presently pursuing under the emblem of 'Ariadne's thread'. From a salutogenetic point of view the elderly rural women on Crete, and from a pathogenetic point of view the elderly urban women in Linköping warrant particular attention.

Some recent studies have found a relation between the number of siblings 3-4-year-old children have and their performance on false belief tasks. 2 experiments reported here examine a variety of factors in children's social environments, including daily contact with peers and adults as well as the numbers of their siblings, on a battery of false belief tests. In Experiment 1, 82 preschoolers were studied in Rethymnon, Crete, in order to obtain a range of extended kin available as a resource for the child. In Experiment 2, 75 Cypriot preschoolers were studied in Nicosia in order to examine the influences of each child's daily social contacts, as measured by maternal questionnaire. Logistic regression revealed that the factors which account for most of the predicted variance on the theory of mind tests were (a) the number of adult kin available (Experiment 1) or adults interacted with daily (Experiment 2), (b) the child's age, (c) the number of older siblings a child has, and (d) the number of older children interacted with daily. The results suggested that theory of mind is not simply passed from one sibling to another in a process of social influence. It seems more likely that a variety of knowledgeable members of her or his culture influence the apprentice theoretician of mind.

The Draeger's rotor microkeratome was used to create a 150 microns thick 8.5 x 9.5 mm corneal flap, and the stromal bed was ablated for the myopic correction using the Munnerlynn photorefractive keratectomy algorithm. The preoperative spherical equivalent ranged from -8.50 to -25.87 diopters (D). Attempted correction ranged from 8.00 to 16.00 D. Four eyes developed complications (i.e., anterior chamber perforation and keratoconus, intrastromal epithelial cells, macular lacquer cracks, and transient endothelial decompensation) and were excluded from the study. The remaining 39 eyes were retrospectively divided into two groups--A (21 eyes) and B (18 eyes)--according to the preoperative spherical equivalent (higher or lower than -14.00 D, respectively). Refraction and corneal topography stabilized between 4 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was within one Snellen line in all eyes. At 24 months, 19 eyes (79.2%) were within 2.00 D of intended correction. Attempted correction (12.20 D +/- 2.30 [SD]) was very close to mean achieved correction at 12 and 24 months (11.60 +/- 2.65 D). Mean postoperative astigmatism at 24 months (1.41 +/- 0.87 D; range 0 to 3.50 D) was close to the mean preoperative value (1.52 +/- 1.08 D; range 0 to 4.00 D). An average 2.43% endothelial cell loss was observed at 24 months. With limitations, LASIK could be considered as a treatment for moderate and high myopia."

After 6 to 12 months, the mean corneal sensation following PRK was 39.2 mm (range 30 to 55 mm) (mean 9.5 months) and after LASIK, 53.6 mm (range 40 to 60 mm) (mean 9.3 months). The mean correction attempted for PRK was 7.05 diopters (D) (range 2.5 to 12.0 D) and for LASIK, 11.71 D (range 6.0 to 20.0 D). In this group of patients, with correction of primarily severe myopia, corneal sensation was significantly greater after LASIK than after PRK."

A follow-up study was conducted to identify the heart disease risk-factor status and dietary changes of surviving elderly subjects in Crete who took part in the Seven Countries Study in 1960. In 1991, data were obtained from 245 of the 686 original male participants (169 of the original 40-49-y age group and 76 men 50-59 y age group). In 1991, the men were 70-79 and 80-89 y old. There was a significant (11.5%) increase in serum total cholesterol concentrations between 1960 and 1991. Body mass index and systolic and diastolic blood pressures also increased significantly, and all age groups were characterized by central obesity. A representative subsample of 21 men took part in a 3-d weighed food record study. Dietary data indicated increases in the intake of saturated fat and decreases in monounsaturated fat over the 30-y period. Comparison with a 1962 representative Cretan sample indicated a significantly increased concentration of adipose palmitic acid (16:0) in our surviving sample. The observed changes occurred during a period when many developed countries were observing a decline in most heart disease risk factors.

II. The male gender.	The conception of new, 'avoidable' life style diseases in affluent Western societies is largely based upon observations in groups of middle-aged urban males with mortality as the major end-point. This applies to cancer, too, and studies of morbidity, where cancer is put within the overall disease spectrum, are called for as a necessary intermediary stage for hypothesis generation and initiation of evaluative and interventive epidemiological projects in the community. Here also the conditions and circumstances that determine health and well being, that is, salutogenetic factors, come increasingly into focus. We made a comparative analysis of the total hospitalization for somatic diseases during 1986-1987 at the Linköping University Hospital in the county of Ostergötland, Sweden and the both complementary and commensurable Heraklion University Hospital on Crete. They are representative of their respective European situations, and are the only somatic hospitals in their regions. Large differences were found with lower morbidity in the more 'Arcadian', rural settings. The results provide valuable data on traits and patterns between earlier surveys such as the Seven Countries study and today. We have earlier reported on the findings from the female group of the two populations, and here wish to concentrate on the males. In particular, cancer is compared with the both prominent and 'archetypical' forms of male ill-health that are comprised by cardiovascular diseases and accidents. We discuss some of the salutogenetic as well as pathogenetic factors that call for closer study in the next stage of our project, whose emblem of Ariadne's thread we feel also has a strong bearing on the masculine gender.

To determine the prevalence of hepatitis A, B, and C markers in children who were attending junior and senior high schools in a high risk area in rural Crete, Greece. Three-hundred and thirty-four children who attended the three junior schools and one senior high school in the Agios Vassilios province of Southern Crete were invited to participate in the study. Three hundred and four of them were tested for hepatitis A, B, and C markers. Hepatitis B (HBV) markers (HBsAg and anti-HBc) as well as hepatitis A (anti-HAV) and hepatitis (anti-HCV) antibodies were tested with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Six of the 304 children (1.97%) were found to be positive for anti-HAV, 1 (0.33%) to HBsAg, 7 (2.30%) to anti-HBc and none were found positive for anti-HCV. No significant differences were seen between the prevalence of anti-HAV antibodies in males (2%) and females (1.95%), and of anti-HBc antibodies in males (3.33%) and females (1.30%). The very low prevalence of anti-HAV is obviously due to the improved conditions of hygiene and it raises the question of the possible emergence of this disease at an older age and therefore appropriate preventative strategies should be considered. The low endemicity of hepatitis B in Crete in contrast to other areas of Greece also calls for a vaccination policy probably during adolescence. The absence of hepatitis C markers in the children in contrast to the observed higher prevalence of HCV-infected people in the adult population in the same rural area raises questions regarding possible sources of transmission of hepatitis C during the preceding years.

The Biomed CF Mutation Analysis Consortium.	"The geographic distribution of 272 cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations has been studied by assessing the origin of 27,177 CF chromosomes from 29 European countries and three countries from the North of Africa. The most common mutations are delta F308 (66.8%), G542X (2.6%), N1303K (1.6%), G551D (1.5%) and W1282X (1.0%). The delta F508 mutation has the highest frequency in Denmark (87.2%) and the lowest in Algeria (26.3%). Mutation G542X is common in the Mediterranean countries, with a mean frequency of 6.1%. N1303K is found in most of the western and Mediterranean countries and has the highest frequency in Tunisia (17.2%). The wide distribution of these mutations suggests an ancient origin. G551D is common in north-west and central Europe, but is uncommon in other parts of Europe. W1282X has the highest frequency in Israel (36.2%), being also common in most Mediterranean countries and north Africa. Seventeen mutation have frequencies between 0.1 and 0.9%, 1717-1G--&gt;A (0.83%), R553X (0.75%), R1162X (0.51%), 621 + 1G--&gt;T (0.54%) and 2183AA--&gt;G (0.36%), being the most common ones. Some mutations reach relatively high frequencies in some extended geographic regions, such as mutation 394delTT in northern Europe (1.1-28.8%), R117H in northwestern Europe (1.3-3.0%), R553X in central Europe (1.1-24.4%), 1717-1G--&gt;A in Belgium and France (1.1-5.3%), and 2183AA--&gt;G in Italy and Greece (3.2%). Other mutations are only common in small regions: T338I (Sardinia), 711 + 1G--&gt;T (Tunisia), R1162X (Algeria and north of Italy), 1609delCA (east of Spain), 1811 + 1.6kbA--&gt;G (southeastern Spain), R1066C (Portugal), S549R (Algeria), R334W (Crete), 621 + 1G--&gt;T (Central Greece), 3849 + 10kbC--&gt;T (Israel), 2789 + 5G--&gt;A (south of Greece), 451 + 1G--A (Israel), R347P (south of Bulgaria), 1677delTA (south of Bulgaria and Turkey), G85E (south of Greece), R347H (Turkey), 3905insT (Switzerland), 1078delT (Brittany), 1898 + 1G--&gt;A (Wales), A455E (The Netherlands), delta I507 (Brittany), 3659delC (Sweden) and R560T (northern Ireland). Most of these mutations must have an origin and diffusion in the specific European population subgroup. Overall 55 mutations are common in one or several countries or regions of Europe and 217 mutations are rare with relative frequencies of lower than 1% in any of these regions and countries. This information might facilitate mutation analysis of CF in the different regions of Europe."

Implications for primary and secondary prevention. 	"Patients with coronary artery disease are advised to augment their dietary linoleic acid intakes at the expense of saturated fatty acids. We investigated whether the dietary linoleic acid intake of 57 patients with coronary artery disease (47 males, 10 females; ages 61 +/- 10 years) in Curaçao is higher as compared with 77 controls (51 males, 26 females; ages 56 +/- 7 years). For this, we measured plasma cholesterol ester fatty acids, which reflect the dietary fatty acid composition of the preceding weeks. Patients with coronary artery disease and controls had minor differences in cholesterol ester fatty acids. Their cholesterol ester linoleic acid content suggests that the dietary polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio is far below 1. Comparison with data reported for The Netherlands, Greenland and Crete showed that the dietary fatty acid composition in Curaçao is typically Western with a high intake of saturated fatty acids, a low intake of monounsaturated fatty acids and the consumption of linoleic acid as the predominant polyunsaturated fatty acid. Intake of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids from fatty fish is low. Reduction of dietary saturated fatty acids, augmentation of fish consumption, and an increase of the alpha-linolenic/linoleic acid ratio are likely to be of benefit to both primary and secondary prevention from coronary artery disease in Curaçao."

Murine typhus, caused by Rickettsia typhi, is an important zoonosis in all parts of the world. The disease is transmitted from rodents to humans by fleas. In this article we describe the first three cases of serologically proven murine typhus imported into Norway during the 1990s. The patients were Norwegian tourists who had visited respectively Guinea-Bissau, Crete and Thailand. They all became acutely ill with fever, chills and severe headache 1-10 days after return to Norway. None of them had a rash. Two patients were admitted to hospital, and one was treated with ciprofloxacin for suspected typhoid fever. All the patients recovered without sequelae. The diagnosis of murine typhus was based on detection of IgM-anti-bodies against R typhi in serum samples during reconvalescence.

"During the six-month period April to September 1995, all 730 road traffic injury victims who contacted any of the three hospitals of the Heraklion District in the island of Crete, directly or through the Medical Emergency Transportation Network, were recorded. A special form was completed containing information about selected characteristics of the victims, nature of the injuries and conditions of the accident. All 39 fatalities owing to road traffic accidents were also registered. In the absence of data concerning the person-time at risk only proportional analyses could be performed. On the basis of Greek hospital discharge statistics in Heraklion District during 1992, one foreigner visitor was discharged owing to injuries of any type for every 18 Greeks. The corresponding ratio for road traffic accidents is close to 1:3, underlying the importance of road traffic accidents as the major health hazard during pleasure travelling. Left-side driving country nationals were at an increased risk for traffic accident when they drove a rented rather than an owned vehicle (p = 0.02), possibly on account of maladaptation during the adjustment period in the country of visit. Moreover, road traffic victims from left-side driving countries compared with foreigners from right-side driving countries were involved 2.5 times more frequently in accidents in which overpassing or other driving maneuvers require reflexes conditioned on reverse directionality (p = 0.02). Alcohol abuse was reported as a primary cause of accident in a significantly higher proportion of foreign nationals (p &lt; 10(-6)) reflecting the fact that the latter group was on vacation. Alcohol intoxication was more common among Eastern European victims than among victims from European Union countries (p &lt; 10(-5)). The likelihood of death following hospitalization ranged from 0% among those with a Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or higher, to 90% among those with GCS less than 8. After adjustment for exact GCS score there was no difference in the probability of death or the likelihood for admission to intensive care unit between Greek and foreign nationals. Road traffic accidents are a major hazard during pleasure travelling and victims of such accidents among travellers have a distinct epidemiologic profile compared with accidents of a similar nature among locals."

To estimate the frequency of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and Coombs positivity without overt hemolysis in ulcerative colitis, to determine possible subsets of patients with ulcerative colitis susceptible to this complication, and to assess the efficacy of the applied therapeutic modalities. Three hundred and two patients with ulcerative colitis treated at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, over a 6-yr period were included. Within this group, a subgroup of 152 patients were studied prospectively for the presence of a positive direct Coombs test. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia was diagnosed in five of 302 patients with ulcerative colitis (1.7%). One more patient developed Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, attributed to sulfasalazine. A positive Coombs test without evidence of hemolysis was found in three of 152 patients (2%). The mean age of all Coombs-positive patients was 50.5 yr, and there was a definitive male preponderance (male: female, 2:1). Autoimmune hemolytic anemia occurred during active colitis in all cases. The mean time between the onset of colitis and the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia was 17 months. Three of five patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (60%) and seven of nine of all Coombs-positive patients (77.7%) had total colitis. All patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia were treated initially with large doses of corticosteroids. Three of five (60%) had good hematological responses. One patient responded to the addition of azathioprine, and one underwent splenectomy and proctocolectomy. In this study, the frequency with which autoimmune hemolytic anemia was associated with ulcerative colitis was higher than in previous reports. The complication occurred early in the course of colitis and was related to activity and extent of the disease. In contrast to others studies, we found a preponderance of males. Although corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive therapy was successful in most of our cases, one patient required surgery.

Stool specimens from 3,600 diarrhoeal patients from the island of Crete, Greece, were examined for bacterial pathogens, during a three-year period (1992-1994). One or more pathogens were identified in 826 patients (22.9%), more often from children. Salmonella spp. were the most frequently isolated organisms in 13.6% of the patients, followed by Campylobacter in 4.7%, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) in 3.9%. Yersinia enterocolitica was found in 0.7%, Shigella spp. in 0.7% and Aeromonas hydrophila in 0.05%. Vibrio spp. and enterohaemorragic E. coli were not identified in the stools tested. Resistance to ampicillin was observed in 36% of the Salmonella, 62% of the Shigella, and 27% of the EPEC isolates. Cotrimoxazole resistance was observed in 42% of the Shigella and 12% of the EPEC isolates, while tetracycline and the quinolones were inactive against almost half and erythromycin against 20% of the Campylobacter isolates. This is the first study investigating bacterial pathogens associated with diarrhoea on the island of Crete.

Association with hepatitis C virus. 	To investigate the clinical characteristics of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Crete and to analyse the natural course of the untreated disease. Seventy-three patients (62 men) were enrolled in a prospective 4-year study. Clinical and virological parameters were recorded. Diagnosis was based on either ultrasound guided liver biopsy or a pathognomonic increase in alpha-fetoprotein plus compatible imaging. Statistical analysis was performed using histograms, contingency tables and one-way analyses of variance to analyse the characteristics of the disease. For survival analysis Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox's proportional hazards models were constructed. HCC in Crete is a mostly male disease (7:1 male:female ratio) and unlike in mainland Greece, it is mostly a hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related disease (54% HCV positive as opposed to only 13% in mainland Greece). Prognosis was associated with Okuda classification (Okuda stage III patients have a relative risk of dying that is seven to nine times higher than for Okuda stage I), the presence or absence of hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). By contrast the presence of anti-HCV was not associated with a worse prognosis. A unit increase of albumin concentration was associated with an 11% decrease in the hazard rate. In general, Crete, despite the extremely similar population to the rest of Greece, resembles more closely the situation in Spain or Italy rather than mainland Greece.
PMID:9430390	Renaud SC	Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 57(4-5):423-7	1997	Dietary management of cardiovascular diseases. 	Since cholesterol was discovered in atherosclerotic plaques and was able, when given in diet, to induce the same type of lesions in animals, the aim of previous dietary changes was to reduce serum cholesterol as much as possible. For this purpose, the intake of saturated fats was decreased and replaced by linoleic acid, the main fatty acid lowering cholesterol. Nevertheless, this type of diet in primary or secondary prevention did not succeed in reducing satisfactorily cardiovascular and total mortality unless the intake of fish (DART and Hjermann trials) i.e. of n-3 fatty acids, was increased. On the other hand, the diet with the greatest life expectancy in the western world is that of Crete, largely vegetarian with a high intake of alpha-linolenic acid. Such a diet, compared to the usual prudent diet in 600 patients after a first myocardial infarction, reduced within a few months all cause mortality and cardiovascular events by more than 70%. Thus a highly palatable diet adapted from Crete seems to be much more efficient to prevent recurrences and death after a first myocardial infarction than the hypocholesterolemic diet presently advised.

Among 1685 patients who sustained a hip fracture at the island of Crete (Greece) in a 4-year period we found 106 patients with bilateral noncontemporary hip fractures. Pathologic hip fractures and fractures that emerged from high energy trauma were excluded. To investigate the possible factors predisposing to the later fracture in the sound hip, we studied these 106 patients and compared them with the 1579 patients who sustained a single hip fracture (control group). There was no significant difference between the mean age of the bilateral group at the time of the first hip fracture (78.3 +/- 7.4 years, range 52-94 years) and the mean age of the control group (77.3 +/- 11.9 years, range 50-101 years). We found no significant difference in the bone status between the two groups, using both lumbar spine dual photon absorptiometry (DXA) and calcaneus broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA). Falls, which were the main cause of all the hip fractures, were much more common in the bilateral group. The second hip fracture was of the same location (trochanteric or cervical) in 92% of the trochanteric and 68% of cervical fractures and a tendency to greater displacement or instability was observed. Of the second hip fractures 75% happened in the first 48 months after the first one. The mean interval time was much longer (160 months) when a neck fracture was followed by a trochanteric one.

Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital and Laboratory of Clinical Virology, Medical School, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Abortion material from 102 cases of women with spontaneous abortion was analysed for the presence of HSV DNA applying the PCR technique. Serological assays were used for the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies in the maternal sera of 90 pregnant women with successful outcome of their pregnancy while 70 non-pregnant women at reproductive age were also examined as control. The HSV genome was detected by PCR amplification in 3 cases of spontaneous abortion, 2 of them exhibited serological markers of virus reactivation while the 3rd showed a past infection. There were no obvious clinical manifestations indicating a current herpes infection. Both groups of pregnant women, either with spontaneous abortion or with a successful outcome of pregnancy, displayed serological markers of HSV reactivation at higher rates compared with non-pregnant women (chi2, p &lt; 0.05). Using the PCR technique we were able to detect the HSV genome in gestational tissues of spontaneous abortions, even in cases without any clinical symptoms or seropositivity for a primary infection. Serological assays were not very useful for the elucidation of the role of HSV in inducing spontaneous abortions, although they indicate that the state of pregnancy predisposes to HSV reactivation. However, the detection of HSV in 3 out of a total number of 102 cases does not support HSV infection as a major abortion-related factor."

"Modern health systems research and development emphasize the transition from hospital to primary health care. Importantly, this transition is projected to be coordinated and interactive, as facilitated, e.g., by improved information systems and collaboration between the involved parties, including Universities and health authorities. An ideal combination of this might accordingly be offered by a synthesis of a basic hospital and primary health care center in an area of suitable site, size, and structure. We believe that our institution, Nosokomion Neapolis, in; the moderate-size Cretan township of Neapolis (New-city) offers an interesting model example of this, because of its affiliation with the University of Heraklion and its international and EU-supported project status. In the present report we want to emphasize the elements that are particularly well suited and manageable and in many ways both opportunistic and conscientious ""back to the future"" instances of a successful Hospital/Primary Health Care integration.

"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relation state and trait anxiety and adipose tissue essential fatty acid precursors for prostaglandins E1 and E2. The sample consisted of 144 male and female Cretan adults, 23 to 69 years of age. Anthropometric and arterial blood pressure measurements were taken, and adipose tissue samples as well as data concerning general health habits were collected. Dietary data were collected using the weekly food frequency questionnaire and the 24-hour dietary recall method, while state and trait anxiety was assessed through the use of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Zung anxiety scale. State anxiety (STAI) related positively with sex (p &lt; 0.0003) and negatively with adipose fat myristic acid (C14:0) (p &lt; 0.004). Similarly, Zung trait anxiety related positively with sex (p &lt; 0.0001) and negatively with adipose tissue myristic acid (C14:0) (p &lt; 0.04). Spielberger trait anxiety related positively with adipose (LA + ALA)/(AA + EPA) ratio (p &lt; 0.0002) and negatively with (C14:0) (p &lt; 0.02) and dietary monounsaturated fat (p &lt; 0.03). It appears that the positive relation between trait anxiety and adipose (LA + ALA)/(AA + EPA) ratio may stem from the inhibiting role of catecholamines on delta 6 and delta 5 desaturases."

"The causative organisms, clinical manifestations, factors influencing prognosis, and other epidemiological characteristics of 81 episodes of bacteremia due to gram-negative organisms, in non-neutropenic patients, were studied retrospectively during a 3-year period (1992-1994) at the Department of Internal Medicine of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. The gram-negative bacteremia incidence was 2% and the overall mortality 12%. All 81 patients had fever; Escherichia coli was the most frequent organism isolated (from 47 patients--58%) and was associated with shock (9/47), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (8/47), anuria (5/47), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (3/47), and pneumonia (1/47). Other less frequent gram-negative microorganisms were Klebsiella spp. (ten patients; 12%), Pseudomonas spp. (7; 7%), Salmonella spp. (5; 6%), Enterobacter spp. (5; 6%), Proteus spp. (3; 3.4%), Stenotrophomonas spp. (3; 3.4%), and Acinetobacter spp. (1; 1.2%). ARDS. shock, DIC, anuria, presence of central venous catheter, urinary catheter, unknown origin of infection and inappropriate treatment were significantly associated with a higher death rate. Early initiation of appropriate therapy was the most important intervention that favorably affected the outcome of gram-negative bacteremias in this patient population."

Over a period of 6 years (1989 to 1995), serum samples from 3,300 patients suspected to be infected by Coxiella burnetii were assayed for the presence of antibodies against antigen phase II of the microorganism by the indirect immunofluorescence antibody technique (IFAT). One hundred fifty-two cases were recorded, and blood samples from 17 patients were cultured for the isolation of the pathogen. By a centrifugation shell vial technique, eight strains were isolated from patients suffering from acute Q fever. The microorganism was detected in the cultures by IFAT, by Gimenez staining, and by the cytopathogenic effect on Vero and human embryonic lung (HEL) cells. PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to confirm the diagnosis and identify the Coxiella burnetii strains within the cell cultures as well as to compare them with reference strains. In order to avoid time-consuming cultures, to achieve direct detection of Coxiella burnetii in clinical samples (blood, buffy coat, etc.), and to increase the specificity and sensitivity of the detection, nested PCR was performed. The first step of DNA extraction was performed with the QIAamp blood kit 250. For the second step of the PCR assays, the conditions of temperature and times of recycling were properly modified, and the microorganism was detected within 4 h. Our study demonstrates that Q fever is an endemic disease in Crete and that the diagnosis of Coxiella burnetii infection can be rapidly achieved by the detection of the microorganism in buffy coat samples by nested PCR. Although the presenting symptoms of the disease in this study differed from those in other studies, the Cretan strains do not differ genotypically from the reference strains (Nine Mile and Q212).

Discoveries of some ancient medical instruments and equipment found in the Hellenic world have been published in magazines of general interest and in a rare Greek medical journal, yet none caught the attention of ophthalmologists. Among these instruments are two forms of the famous 'Kenteterion', dating from the Hellenistic period, used for the couching of cataract. These were found on the island of Milos in the last century. Two magnifying lenses of the Archaic period from the recent Cretan excavations gave us the opportunity to discuss the problem of their medical use. The two drop-bottles from the excavations on Cyprus and at Tanagra, which are also described, seem to be of medical, and possible ophthalmological, use.

Pathological specimens from 1361 patients with clinical manifestations of dermatophytosis from the island of Crete, Greece, were examined for dermatophytes during a 5-year period (1992-96). Dermatophytes of the genus Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton were isolated from 327 (24%) of the patients. Trichophyton rubrum was the most frequently isolated dermatophyte accounting for 44.4% of the strains, followed by M. canis (25%), T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale (14.4%) and E. floccosum (7.6%). Less frequent isolates included T. mentagrophytes (3.4%), T. violaceum (3.1%), T. verrucosum (1.8%) and M. gypseum (0.3%). An analysis of the distribution and frequency of the dermatophytes according to the cutaneous area affected and the sex of the patients is also reported.

Fatal and non-fatal acute poisonings and other sudden deaths examined in the Toxicology Laboratory of University Hospital of Iraklion, Crete, from 1991 to 1996 mainly involved the abuse of drugs (heroin, flunitrazepam and other psychoactive substances), accidental poisonings or suicide attempts with pesticides (carbamates, organophosphates, paraquat), other chemicals (cyanide salts, paint thinner, chlorine), traffic accidents, drownings and violent deaths (gunshots). Many of the cases were related to poisonous gases or volatiles (carbon monoxide, methylbromide). Fatalities due to alcohol and methylene-dioxy-ethyl amphetamine were also examined. Amphetamine and alcohol-related deaths due to drowning were more recent. A significant number of cases were related to the accidental ingestion of alcohol, drugs or suicide attempts by children. Some of the cases were treated successfully in various Cretan hospitals, while others had fatal outcomes due to late hospital admission.

"Postprandial lipaemic responses to two test meals were investigated in 30 Northern (15 British and 15 Irish), and 30 Southern (Greeks from Crete) healthy male Europeans. The meals were a saturated fatty acid (SFA) meal, which resembled the fatty acid composition of an average UK diet, and a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) meal in which the fat consisted of olive oil. Habitual diets of the two groups differed, with higher total fat, (P &lt; 0.03) and MUFA (P &lt; 0.0001) and lower polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (P &lt; 0.0001) intakes in Southern than Northern Europeans. Levels of total MUFA (P &lt; 0.02) and oleic acid (P &lt; 0.004) were also higher in adipose tissue of Southern in comparison to Northern Europeans. In both European groups there were no significant differences in postprandial triglyceride response between the two meal types, SFA or MUFA. However, Northern and Southern Europeans showed significant differences in their patterns of postprandial response in plasma triglycerides (P &lt; 0.0001), apolipoprotein B-48 (P &lt; 0.0001), NEFA (P &lt; 0.0001), insulin (P &lt; 0.0007), and factor VII activity (P-0.03). In the case of NEFA, areas under the response curve were higher following the SFA than the MUFA meal for both groups, (P &lt; 0.003) and were greater in Southern than Northern Europeans (P &lt; 0.002) and apo B-48 responses were lower (P &lt; 0.005). Some of these differences may reflect differences in fasting levels since fasting apolipoprotein B-48 levels were lower (P &lt; 0.01) and fasting NEFA (P &lt; 0.02) and insulin (P &lt; 0.005) were higher in the Southern than in the Northern Europeans. In addition, 9 h postprandial post-heparin lipoprotein lipase activity was lower in the Southern than in the Northern Europeans (P &lt; 0.0006). This is the first report of differences in postprandial lipid, factor VII and insulin responses in Southern and Northern Europeans which may be of importance in explaining the different susceptibilities of these two populations to risk of coronary artery disease."

"We report a new type of non-deletional hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin that is due to a C--&gt;T transition at position -158, relative to the Cap site of the human Agamma-globin gene. This mutation was identified in three unrelated adult cases presenting slightly elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), i.e. 2.9-5.1%, and normal hematological indices. Our sequencing results, from both polymerase chain reaction-amplified and subcloned DNA fragments, indicate that the A gamma -158C--&gt;T mutation occurred by two independent gene conversion events in the three cases studied. In addition, hematological and molecular data, including restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotyping in the beta-globin gene cluster, extended haplotype analysis inside the gamma-globin gene region and routine analysis of three tandem repeat loci (D1S80, 3'HVR/apoB and F8vWf), led us to conclude that the A gamma -158C--&gt;T mutation in one of the three cases occurred recently in the parental germ line (P=99.47%), representing the first example of a de novo gene conversion event identified in humans."

"Sixty-two samples of Pichtogalo Chanion cheese traditionally produced in Crete, a few (3 to 6) days old, were analyzed for some chemical and bacteriological characteristics. The results of physicochemical analyses were as follows: (1) moisture content 61.63% (standard deviation 4.67); (2) fat in dry matter 54.03% (SD 7.73); (3) protein content 14.23% (SD 1.72); (4) salt content 1.02% (SD 0.38); (5) water activity (aw) 0.990 (SD 0.003); and (6) pH 4.36 (SD 0.25). None of the samples yielded Salmonella spp. Listeria monocytogenes and coagulase-positive staphylococci were present in 6.45% of the samples. Bacillus cereus and sulfite-reducing clostridia were isolated from 14.51% and 40.32% of the samples, respectively. High populations of coliforms were determined in the cheese samples. In 11.3% of the samples, Escherichia coli was not detected, while 88.7% of the samples yielded E. coli most probable number levels from 1.32 to 5.66 log10/g. The log10 CFU/g counts of enterococci were 6.89 (SD 0.84), of yeasts 6.79 (SD 0.61), of molds 4.68 (SD 0.69), and of psychrotrophic bacteria 7.63 (SD 0.62). The log10 CFU/g counts of lactic acid streptococci and lactococci were 7.91 (SD 0.68) and of lactobacilli 8.11 (SD 0.65). Lactic acid bacteria, mainly mesophilic, were isolated and confirmed using API 50 CH test trips. A pasteurized mixture of ewe's and goat's milk was made into Pichtogalo Chanion cheese according to standard procedure at 23 degrees C, after the addition of 4% commercial mesophilic starter culture or 2%, 3%, and 4% starter culture of the isolated and confirmed lactic acid bacteria and the addition of rennet. Results of this work indicated that high quality of Pichtogalo Chanion cheese can be produced using a pasteurized mixture of ewe's and goat's milk and 4% (vol/vol) of mesophilic starter culture."

Sediment samples were collected in the oligotrophic Cretan Sea (eastern Mediterranean, from 40 to 1,540 m in depth) and compared to the distribution and composition of the benthic microbial assemblages (i.e., bacteria and microprotozoa). DNA concentrations measured spectrophotometrically and by HPLC were not significantly different, while fluorometric yields were significantly lower. Such differences appear mainly due to fact that the stain-DNA complex is strongly dependent on the DNA composition and structure. RNA concentrations determined by the three methods displayed some differences; fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods obtain RNA concentration by difference and therefore may be biased by DNA estimates. By contrast, the HPLC method provides independent assessments of RNA and DNA concentrations. We tentatively estimated the contribution of the detrital DNA to the total DNA pools in two ways. The two calculations provided quite similar results indicating that the majority of the DNA pool in the deep-sea sediments was detrital. Microbial RNA generally accounted for almost the entire sedimentary RNA pools below 100-m depth. RNA concentrations were found to decrease along the Cretan shelf and slope. The RNA/DNA ratio calculated by using fluorometric DNA concentrations was significantly correlated with values of sediment community oxygen consumption only below 100-m depth (dominated by the microbial biomass). These data suggest that the RNA/DNA ratio, based on fluorometric estimates of DNA, can be used as an indicator of benthic metabolic activity, but only when metazoan contribution to the microbial DNA is negligible."

DNA of HHV-8 (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated Herpes virus [KSHV]) was detected in a biopsy of a Kaposi's sarcoma in an elderly male patient from Saxony (East Germany). The diagnosis of classical Kaposi's sarcoma was first made in 1986. During World War II, the patient had been on active service on the Greek Islands of Crete and Rhodes only, he did not travel outside East Germany after the war. It is assumed that the patient was infected during his stay on the islands of Crete or Rhodes, where classical Kaposi's sarcoma is endemic. If so, the incubation period of classical Kaposi's sarcoma could be as long as 40 years.

In agricultural areas where greenhouses and dwellings are intermixed, the general population as well as the professional applicators may be exposed to pesticides. In a field study on Crete, exposure to methyl bromide during soil fumigation was assessed. Exposure of applicators (both contractors and farmers) were measured with personal air sampling equipment. Environmental monitoring inside and outside greenhouses combined with meteo data formed the basis for calculating the exposure of the general population with a computer aided dispersion model. Exposure of contractors exceeded the TLV value. The safe limit for the general population living close to a fumigated greenhouse is also exceeded.

To evaluate the incidence of microsatellite instability in spontaneously aborted embryos. Retrospective study. Laboratory of Clinical Virology and Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital, Medical School, University of Crete. Thirty-five women in whom spontaneous abortions occurred between the 6th and 20th weeks of pregnancy. Thirty-five aborted embryonic tissues were analyzed with seven microsatellite markers, and their haplotypes were compared with the corresponding pattern of their parents. Microsatellite DNA. Microsatellite instability was observed in 8 of 35 cases (23%). In 7 of 8 positive cases, microsatellite instability was restricted to one of the seven microsatellite markers, whereas in one case, three microsatellite markers were affected by instability. A statistically significant association was found between microsatellite instability and a previous normal childbirth. Genetic instability is a detectable phenomenon in spontaneous abortions, representing a significant increase in the mutational rate of the embryo and providing evidence for a mechanism associated with the phenomenon of spontaneous abortion. We conclude that this elevated mutational rate affects active genomic sequences that play a critical role in the viability of the embryo, leading to cell death and abortion.

"The susceptibility to 11 antibiotics was determined for 52 strains of Shigella isolated from patients with diarrheal disease in Crete, Greece, during the period 1991-1995. Forty-six percent of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 48% to tetracycline, 44.2% to chloramphenicol, and 28.8% to cotrimoxazole. Shigella flexneri was more resistant than S. sonnei to ampicillin (82 vs 4.3%), to tetracycline (82 vs 8.7%) and to cotrimoxazole (42.8 vs 13%). Overall, 82% of all S. flexneri isolates were resistant to the three or four antimicrobial agents tested. The beta-lactamases produced by shigellae were identified by isoelectric focusing and were found to be OXA-1, TEM-1, and a low-level beta-lactamase with a pI&gt;8. The results from the present study, which is the first carried out in Crete, emphasize the need for continuous surveillance of resistance and control of antibiotic usage."

A school-based immunization survey was used to assess vaccination coverage of a population of children in the region of three Primary Health Care Centres in rural Crete. The medical charts of 771 (92.6% of the total) students attending primary schools at the municipalities of Archanes and Hersonissos in the district of Heraklion, and Neapolis in the district of Lasithi, as well as the charts of 438 (68.9% of the total) students attending the secondary school at Neapolis, Lasithi, were obtained. The immunization records from these charts were then compiled and analysed. All information was based on the standardized procedures of the Spili Health Centre, Crete. The age-specific vaccination rate was calculated for children of both primary and secondary school age. The vaccination coverage against diphtheria and tetanus was high (82%, 1035 pupils had received the fifth dose) for both groups of students, while the coverage for pertussis was incomplete, especially the fifth dose, which had been received by only 17% (n = 131) of the children of primary school age and 4.3% (n = 19) of the children of secondary school age. In total, 638 of the children of primary school age (82.7%) and 257 (58.7%) of the children of secondary school age were immunized against measles. The corresponding numbers and the percentages of children of primary and secondary school age immunized against mumps and rubella were: 75.6% (n = 583) and 36.3% (n = 159) for mumps, and 74.7% (n = 576) and 32% (n = 140) for rubella. Immunization coverage of schoolchildren in the studied areas is inadequate in a number of instances. This appears to be most pronounced in children of secondary school age. The school-based immunization survey, which is an accurate and inexpensive tool for assessing vaccination coverage, is suggested as an appropriate means for primary health care workers in Greece to develop further and increase the immunization rate.

"The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of use, the selection criteria for usage and the conditions under which long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is provided on the island of Crete, Greece. A total of 545 patients using oxygen therapy at home in Crete were found from the records held by local hospitals, health insurance offices and oxygen supply companies. After randomization, 100 patients were selected, and finally 79 patients (64 males, 15 females), with a mean age of 71 yrs, were contacted and completed a questionnaire. The majority of patients (n = 57, 72%) using LTOT had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In 67 (85%) patients LTOT was prescribed by a chest physician. All patients used large oxygen cylinders. The duration of daily oxygen use was significantly longer in the group of patients prescribed it by chest physicians than in those who was prescribed it by doctors from other specialities (8.8 h versus 4.7 h, p &lt; 0.05). Of the patients, 47 (60%) fulfilled the criteria for LTOT. However, only 33 (43%) had accurate written instructions on how to use their home oxygen. A significant number of patients (n = 24, 29%) were still smokers and 63 (80%) had had a follow-up assessment. Our results suggest that COPD is the major grounds for LTOT. The daily duration of the oxygen therapy was longer in the group prescribed it by chest physicians. It is a concern that difficulties in setting up oxygen cylinders resulted in some ineffective usage. Physicians should stress the advantages of O2 concentrators."

CICNet. Cretan Infection Control Network. 	Three prevalence studies for the estimation of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) were carried out in eight Greek hospitals on an annual basis during the years 1994-1996. The overall prevalence of HAI was 6.8, 5.5 and 5.9% for the three years, respectively. Among these, urinary tract infections ranged from 22.4 to 38.2%, lower respiratory tract infections ranged from 21.1 to 32.6%, surgical site infections ranged from 14.6 to 22.7% and bloodstream infections ranged from 9.0 to 13.2%. The prevalence of antibiotic usage among the hospitalized patients was found to be 49.3% in 1994, 47.3% in 1995 and 52.7% in 1996. Unjustified prescription of prophylactic usage was found to be the major component of these high percentages. Appropriate use of antibiotics for prophylaxis is one of the priorities of the current infection control programmes. The development of a nationwide network for the surveillance of HAIs in Greece is planned using the experience gained.

We assessed the bone mineral density (BMD), the body mass index (BMI), and the hip axis length (HAL) in 78 postmenopausal women with 38 cervical and 40 trochanteric hip fractures. The results were compared with those of age-matched, control postmenopausal women. No statistically significant difference was found in the values of BMD, BMI, and HAL between the groups of patients with cervical and those with trochanteric fractures, but lower BMD and BMI were found in fracture patients compared with the corresponding values of the control subjects. Contrary to the existing data, HAL was found to be shorter in the fracture patients compared with the controls. Thus, the type of hip fracture was found to be independent of the value of BMD, BMI, and the length of the patient's hip axis. The fact that a shorter hip axis was found in the group of fracture patients compared with that found in the control subjects raises questions about the significance of this parameter as an independent risk factor for hip fracture.

No national policy for health education in schools exists to date in Greece. The first attempt to apply a school-based health education intervention program was launched in 1992 on all 4,171 pupils registered in the first grade in two counties of Crete. The 1,510 pupils registered in a third county served as controls. The school-based intervention and the seminars organized for parents were primarily aimed at improving children's diet, fitness, and physical activity. Pupils in the first grade in a representative sample of 40 schools were examined prior to the intervention program on a variety of health knowledge, dietary, physical activity, fitness, anthropometric, and biochemical indices. The same measurements were taken after 3 years of the program on 288 intervention group and 183 control group pupils. Positive serum lipid level changes occurred to a greater extent in the intervention group than the control group. BMI increased less in the intervention group than for controls. The increase in health knowledge and physical activity and fitness levels occurred to a higher extent in the intervention group compared to controls. The short-term changes observed in the present study are markedly encouraging and indicate great potential for progressive improvement. Continuation and expansion of such a program may prove to be beneficial in initiating long-term changes.

Seamless Telematics Across Regions. 	Seamless collaboration and medical information exchange among health care experts is an open question on existing health care systems. The patient record is usually scattered all over the health care network making access to crucial medical information troublesome. The Star* (Seamless Telematics Across Regions) project provides a set of solutions towards this direction which will soon be applied at Crete. Initially two health care structures will be involved in the process but later on and after tests have been completed successfully in real world applications, results will be defused over the whole health care region of Crete.

"The Cretan HLA gene profile has been compared with those of other Mediterranean populations in order to provide additional information regarding the history of their origins. The allele frequencies, genetic distances between populations, relatedness dendrograms and correspondence analyses were calculated. Our results indicate that the Indoeuropean Greeks may be considered as a Mediterranean population of a more recent origin (after 2000 B.C.), while all other studied Mediterraneans (including Cretans) belong to an older substratum which was present in the area since pre-Neolithic times. A significant Turkish gene flow has not been detected in the Greek or Cretan populations, although Greeks and Turks have two high frequency HLA-DRB-DQB haplotypes in common. It is proposed that Imazighen (Caucasoid Berbers living at present in the North African coast and Saharan areas) are the remains of pre-Neolithic Saharan populations which could emigrate northwards between about 8000-6000 B.C., when desert desiccation began. They also could be part of the stock that gave rise to Sumerians, Cretans and Iberians; this is supported by both linguistic and HLA genetic data."

Appendectomy has been suggested as a possible protective factor in ulcerative colitis and as a risk factor in Crohn's disease. Tonsillectomy has also been associated with Crohn's disease. We performed a case-controlled study to investigate these associations in a homogeneous Greek population. One hundred thirty-four consecutive cases of ulcerative colitis and 76 cases of Crohn's disease were included in the study. For each inflammatory bowel disease patient and a corresponding healthy control subject, matched for gender, age, and educational level, a standard record on various risk factors was completed by interview. The association between disease status and risk factors was assessed by Pearson's chi-squared test and the independent contribution of each risk factor was analyzed by means of logistic regression analysis. Appendectomy had been performed in 11 (8.2 percent) patients with ulcerative colitis, in 18 (13.4 percent) of their matched healthy control cases, in 19 (25.0 percent) patients with Crohn's disease, and in 10 (13.2 percent) of their matched healthy control cases. Odds ratio for development of ulcerative colitis after appendectomy was 0.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.26-1.27). Odds ratio for Crohn's disease was 2.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.94-5.12). Odds ratio for development of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease after tonsillectomy was 0.95 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.49-1.82) and 3.29 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.29-8.37), respectively. The logistic regression analysis showed that appendectomy and tonsillectomy have no independent association with the risk of developing ulcerative colitis, whereas in Crohn's disease both appendectomy and tonsillectomy have positive associations. Well-established risk factors, such as family history and smoking status, were also verified in this study. This case-control study, using multivariate logistic regression analysis, showed a less pronounced association between ulcerative colitis and appendectomy than previous reports. Our data also support the conclusion that tonsillectomy is a risk factor for developing Crohn's disease.

To assess physical activity and physiological fitness parameters among six year old children and to determine whether there were any significant gender differences. comparative study of a representative sample of boys and girls in school and at home. 569 children (305 boys and 264 girls) selected randomly from a total of 6153 registered in the 1st grade in 1992 on the island of Crete. assessment of physical activity was based on observational methods involving teachers and parents. Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated by performance on the 20 meter Shuttle Run Test (20mSRT). BMI, skinfold thickness, Midarm Muscle Circumference (MMC) and hemoglobin were also measured. Both sexes were found to spend a very small proportion of their leisure time in Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activities (MVPA). More boys engaged in MVPA than girls at school and at home, but more girls were involved in physical activity-related lessons and classes out of school. Among the physiological fitness parameters, significant gender differences were found only for MMC. No significant gender difference was found in performance on the 20mSRT. The results indicate that in this culture stereotypic sex preferences in physical activity begin at a very young age, and that this differentiation cannot be attributed to gender differences in cardiorespiratory fitness. The social, environmental and possibly psychological parameters involved have implications for Health Educators and Physical Education Instructors in the appropriate targeting of physical activity promotion programs among young children.

"To evaluate the epidemiological correlation between age-related macular degeneration and pseudoexfoliation syndrome in the inhabitants of the island of Crete (Greece). A total of 777 persons (315 men and 462 women, aged 40-99 years), representing a randomized sample (1.43%) of the Cretan population, underwent slitlamp and fundus examinations according to protocol. The results were statistically analyzed. The prevalence of pseudoexfoliation was 16.1% (21.3% in men and 12.6% in women) and that of maculopathy, 7.9% (11.7% in men and 5.2% in women). The conditions were significantly correlated with each other (P = .002). Also, both displayed a significant direct correlation with age and altitude (for pseudoexfoliation, P&lt;.001 and P = .002 for age and altitude, respectively; for age-related macular degeneration, P&lt;.001 for age and for altitude) and an increase in bilateral incidence with progressing age. The observed prevalences of pseudoexfoliation and maculopathy were lower than those reported in the mainland of Greece and other Mediterranean regions. The correlation between age-related macular degeneration and pseudoexfoliation syndrome may be explained by the relationship of each disease with age and altitude."

A health education intervention was carried out for three consecutive years on primary school Cretan children. Baseline measures were obtained from 962 pupils (509 boys and 453 girls) registered in first grade in 1992. The health education intervention programme was directed at both the children of the intervention group and their parents, and has a projected duration of 6 years. After the completion of the 3 years of intervention and while pupils were in fourth grade, measures were obtained for evaluation purposes on a random subsample of 393 pupils of the original cohort. Statistically greater improvements in the intervention, as opposed to the control group, were observed for both children's and parents' health knowledge, and children's standing broad jump, sit-ups (SUP), sit-and-reach, handgrip and endurance run test (ERT). Furthermore, time spent on moderate to vigorous physical activities out of school significantly increased for intervention group children compared to the control group. Statistically smaller increases in the intervention as opposed to the control group were observed in suprailiac skinfold and body mass index. The degree of improvement in both SUP and ERT related positively to parent's baseline physical activity score. Finally, the parental attitude of health-related hedonism related negatively to SUP improvement.

"A pilot study to explore diet-related atherogenic patterns in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients on the island of Crete. Cretans are well known for their high olive consumption and low atherosclerotic heart disease mortality, in general. Case-control study. This was a hospital-based study initiated in 1991. Catchment area was the island of Crete, Greece. Seventeen patients admitted for treatment to the General State Hospital of Rethimnon. Controls were selected from the general population of the island and consisted of a random sample of 27 subjects from a total of 168 healthy subjects who visited the Preventive Medicine Clinic of the University Hospital for routine check-up. The control group was age- and sex-matched with patients. Both CAPD patients and controls had been residents of Crete for at least the last 10 years. Adipose tissue was aspirated, and a 12-hour fasting blood sample was collected for determination of serum lipid parameters and serum alpha-tocopherol levels; dietary data from a 3-day recall were recorded. No significant differences between the two groups were observed with respect to the mean macronutrient intake. The mean levels of serum triglycerides (p = 0.016) and serum alpha-tocopherol (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in CAPD patients compared to controls. Mean levels of total serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were not significantly different. In CAPD patients the mean total percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was significantly higher (p = 0.006) than in controls. The mean total percentage of saturated fatty acids (p = 0.004), along with the mean percentage of omega-6 (p = 0.002), the mean value of the ratio omega-6/omega-3 (p &lt; 0.0001), and the percentage of linoleic acid (p = 0.001) were significantly lower in CAPD patients than in the controls. Among subjects with higher levels of MUFA in the adipose tissue, the CAPD patients were twice as likely to have high serum alpha-tocopherol (p &lt; 0.001), and 2.6 times more likely to be in high risk of high total cholesterol (TC)/HDL (p = 0.08) compared to the controls. However, CAPD patients with high levels of MUFA in the adipose tissue (above the average of 65%) were unlikely [odds ratio (OR) = 0.001, p &lt; 0.001] to be at risk of high TC/HDL (above the average of 4.1), and maybe unlikely (OR = 0.08, but p = 0.1) to have low serum alpha-tocopherol, when compared with the CAPD patients with low levels of MUFA. CAPD patients with high TC/HDL are 0.15 times less likely (p = 0.1) to have high levels of serum alpha-tocopherol compared to those with low TC/HDL. Cretan CAPD patients demonstrate an interesting profile consisting of unexpectedly positive aspects when atherogenesis-related factors such as those of adipose tissue fatty acid composition, serum lipids, and serum antioxidant alpha-tocopherol are considered."

In a small Cretan township hospital combining secondary and primary care, a questionnaire was distributed to a consecutive visitor sample. The questionnaire requested information on the participants' personal smoking and other life habits, perceptions and expectations of the delivery of the health care services, and attitudes toward their own doctors and others who provide various health services. Three hundred and one individuals of both sexes who were 15 years and older participated in the study (participation rate, more than 97%). An interesting and varied response was recorded, covering a wide range of perceptions, opinions, and attitudes not only toward the services, but also toward the staff. Although a high confidence in and appreciation of both the primary care and hospital sections appeared in the study results, these attitudes should not be allowed to deteriorate. Therefore, specific actions should be undertaken: constant upgrading of the existing organizational context, implementation of promotional and educational programs, and use of the questionnaire as an effective tool for periodically assessing the population's attitudes, experiences, and expectations.

"Recent data suggest that the IGF system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several forms of human cancer, and there is evidence that IGFs acting in an autocrine and paracrine manner may also affect colorectal cancer risk. We have conducted a case-control study on the island of Crete, Greece, to examine the potential relation between circulating IGF-I and -II and their major binding protein (IGF-BP3), on the one hand, and colorectal cancer, on the other. IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-BP3 were determined in the serum from 41 patients with colorectal cancer and 50 healthy controls; data were analyzed using unconditional multiple logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, education, height and BMI, as well as mutually. Both IGF-I and IGF-II were positively, while IGF-BP3 was inversely, associated with risk for colorectal cancer, though none of these relations reached statistical significance. However, individuals with IGF-I and -II values in the upper 2 tertiles of the respective distributions had a significantly elevated odds ratio for colorectal cancer (OR = 5.2, 95% confidence interval 1.0-26.8) compared with those in the lower tertile in both distributions. Our results provide evidence that high levels of circulating IGF-I and -II might be associated with colorectal cancer."

The aim of this survey was to assess the evaluation, management, and future recommendations of patients with the diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy and to evaluate the interest in the creation of a prospective database regarding this rare disorder. A total of 116 surveys were sent to major teaching institutions in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Crete, and South Korea after a national conference held at the National Institutes of Health regarding peripartum cardiomyopathy. This was an open-ended survey containing 17 specific questions regarding this disorder and its management. A total of 78 (67%) maternal-fetal specialists responded to the survey. Diuretics and digoxin were used as first-line treatment for this disorder. Only 6% used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy. Fifty-eight percent of the perinatologists (58%) recommended either intrauterine contraceptive devices or foam and condoms, whereas oral contraceptives (progesterone-only pill or estrogen-progesterone mix) were recommended in 23% and 41%, respectively. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the respondents would recommend future pregnancy if ventricular function returned to normal. Fundamental clinical and basic research is lacking regarding this rare but potentially devastating disorder. Major teaching institutions do not have significant numbers of patients with this disorder to provide concrete recommendations, and starting a database will be useful in the gathering of important epidemiologic information. A secondary aim of such a registry would be to establish a repository for tissue and blood samples to answer basic mechanistic questions about this disorder.

Pneumoconiosis among dental technicians has recently emerged as an area of research in interstitial lung disease. This study was carried out to estimate the prevalence of pneumoconiosis in Greek dental technicians on the island of Crete. Fifty-one of the 58 dental technicians of the Heraklion Dental Technicians' Association completed an exposure history questionnaire and underwent a clinical examination, including chest radiographs, and spirometric assessment of lung volume and diffusing capacity. Values were compared with 51 control subjects. Five dental technicians showed radiological evidence of pneumoconiosis. Mean lung function values of the dental technicians, even in those with pneumoconiosis, were not significantly different from controls. No significant changes in lung function parameters were associated with smoking, exposure to metals and other contaminants. Dental technicians, however, reported more respiratory symptoms than controls (p = 0.008). Symptoms were associated to the absence of a ventilation system. We concluded that occupational exposure in dental technicians in Crete did not affect lung function. The prevalence of pneumoconiosis in this study was 9. 8%.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of chronic idiopathic neutropenia of adults (CINA) among an apparently healthy population born and living on the island of Crete. The study was carried out with 778 subjects, 392 men aged 16-78 years (median 43 years) and 386 women aged 15-79 years (median 40 years). All were employees of the Medical School or the adjacent University hospital and members of their families. Among these there were 64 subjects (8.23%) who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of CINA applied in our department. Mild neutropenia (neutrophils 1700-2499/microl) accounted for 6.81% and moderate neutropenia (neutrophils 600-1699/microl) for the remaining 1.41%. No cases of CINA with severe neutropenia (neutrophils below 600/microl) were found. CINA was more frequent in women, with a women to men ratio of about 3:2. Approximately two thirds of the cases appeared in patients aged 30-59 years. Concomitant thrombocytopenia was found in three of the 64 subjects with CINA. Neutropenic subjects had chronic (perennial) rhinitis 3.4 times more frequently than non-neutropenics. No influence of occupation, use of insecticides and pesticides, contact with industrial chemicals, or administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the development of CINA was documented. We conclude that, despite the biased character of the study (population not randomly selected), our data provide a valuable estimation of the prevalence of CINA in the general population, given that our sample was sufficiently large, was derived from all major regions of the island, and was composed of subjects of both genders and of all age-groups from 15 to 79 years.
PMID:10471132	Simopoulos AP	Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 60(5-6):421-9	1999	Evolutionary aspects of omega-3 fatty acids in the food supply.	"Information from archaeological findings and studies from modern day hunter-gatherers suggest that the Paleolithic diet is the diet we evolved on and for which our genetic profile was programmed. The Paleolithic diet is characterized by lower fat and lower saturated fat intake than Western diets; a balanced intake of omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids; small amounts of trans fatty acids, contributing less than 2% of dietary energy; more green leafy vegetables and fruits providing higher levels of vitamin E and vitamin C and other antioxidants than today's diet and higher amounts of calcium and potassium but lower sodium intake. Studies on the traditional Greek diet (diet of Crete) indicate an omega-6/omega-3 ratio of about 1/1. The importance of a balanced ratio of omega-6:omega-3, a lower saturated fatty acid and lower total fat intake (30-33%), along with higher intakes of fruits and vegetables leading to increases in vitamin E and C, was tested in the Lyon Heart study. The Lyon study, based on a modified diet of Crete, confirmed the importance of omega-3 fatty acids from marine and terrestrial sources, and vitamin E and vitamin C, in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, and cancer mortality."

The Seven Countries Study Research Group.	In the Seven Countries Study, associations between the intake of food-groups and 25-year mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD, defined as sudden coronary death or fatal myocardial infarction) were investigated. Baseline surveys were carried out between 1958 and 1964. A number of individual characteristics were measured in 12,763 middle-aged men belonging to 16 cohorts in seven countries (USA, Finland, The Netherlands, Italy, former Yugoslavia, Greece and Japan). Dietary information was collected in sub-samples using the weighed record method. Vital status of all participants was verified at regular intervals during 25 years of follow-up and the underlying cause of death was adjudicated. Eighteen different food-groups and combinations were considered for comparison among cohorts. Large differences in food-group consumption were seen, with high consumption of dairy products in Northern Europe, meat in the USA, vegetables, legumes, fish, and wine in Southern Europe, and cereals, soy products, and fish in Japan. Population death rates from CHD showed large differences, ranging from 268 per 1000 in East Finland to 25 per 1000 in Crete, Greece. Animal food-groups were directly correlated, and vegetable food-groups (except potatoes) as well as fish and alcohol were inversely correlated with CHD mortality. Univariate analysis showed significant positive correlation coefficients for butter (R = 0.887), meat (R = 0.645), pastries (R = 0.752), and milk (R = 0.600) consumption, and significant negative correlation coefficients for legumes (R = -0.822), oils (R = -0.571), and alcohol (R = -0.609) consumption. Combined vegetable foods (excluding alcohol) were inversely correlated (R = -0.519), whereas combined animal foods (excluding fish) were directly correlated (R = 0.798) with CHD death rates. Multivariate stepwise analysis selected butter, lard + margarine and meat as significant predictors and produced an R2 of 0.922. These findings were confirmed by factor analysis. These cross-cultural analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that dietary patterns are important determinants of differences in population CHD death rates, and confirm the opposite effects on apparent risk of animal and vegetable foods.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of hepatitis markers in inmates and staff of the Penitentiary of Neapolis on Crete and discuss the role of GPs in identifying and vaccinating susceptible subjects. Forty-five prisoners and 20 house workers were invited to participate in the study. Hepatitis B (HBV) markers (HBsAg and anti-HBc) and hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV) were tested. Vaccination against hepatitis B was administered to all susceptible subjects. Hepatitis B carriage was found in 10 people, six of whom were prisoners. Fifteen of the subjects tested were found to be positive for anti-HBc, six of whom were house workers. Anti-HCV were found to be positive in seven prisoners and one worker. A vaccination programme against hepatitis B was introduced in 27 susceptible subjects (58.7% of unexposed subjects) and was completed in 22. Prisoners and staff at Neapolis Prison constitute a high-risk group for hepatitis B and C. Compliance rate in screening was high and GPs were successful in having a desirable response rate in the administration of vaccines.

Primary biliary cirrhosis and ulcerative colitis are two diseases with many features of autoimmunity. Thirteen cases of coexistence of the two diseases have been reported in the literature so far. Patients are usually younger and more often males than the ordinary primary biliary cirrhosis patient, while the colitis is mild and easily controllable. In a homogeneous population of 550,000 inhabitants of the island of Crete, 412 cases of ulcerative colitis and 82 individuals with primary biliary cirrhosis or autoimmune cholangitis have been identified. In two cases, coexistence of the two diseases was found. Immunological screening for AMA positivity in 150 ulcerative colitis sera disclosed no further cases. Prevalence of primary biliary cirrhosis in ulcerative colitis patients seems at least 30 times higher than in the general population in our area. A possible immunological link between the two diseases is discussed.
PMID:10568266	Papucci C, Delfanti R	Sci Total Environ. 237-238:67-75	1999	137Caesium distribution in the eastern Mediterranean Sea: recent changes and future trends.	A series of sampling campaigns were carried out in the eastern Mediterranean in the period 1995-1997, to examine the relationship between the distribution of 137Cs in the water column and water mass circulation. 137Cs concentration in the surface water ranges between 3.3 and 4.0 mBq/l all over the area, indicating that the input due to the Chernobyl accident has been transferred to deep water layers by convection processes. In fact, in the vertical profiles, relative maxima are observed in the intermediate (4 mBq/l) and deep waters (approximately 2.5 mBq/l) formed after the Chernobyl accident. A clear Chernobyl signal also traces the new deep waters formed in the Aegean Sea that, exiting from the Cretan Arc Straits, since 1991 are spreading in the bottom layer of the eastern Mediterranean. The changes in 137Cs vertical profiles related to the new thermohaline circulation of the intermediate and deep waters of the eastern Mediterranean are being monitored at a deep station in the western Ionian Sea. The 1997 profile shows a decrease in 137Cs concentration both in the Levantine intermediate water and in the eastern Mediterranean deep water with respect to 1996. The decrease in Levantine intermediate water is likely due to seasonal/interannual variability, while the changes in the deep layer are related to the spreading westward into the Ionian of the new Aegean dense water. Along the path towards the western Mediterranean, 137Cs content in the Levantine intermediate water decreases from approximately 4 mBq/l in the W-Ionian Sea to approximately 2 mBq/l at the western sill of the Sicily Straits, due to mixing with underlying water, with lower caesium content, near the Malta Sill. Time-series measurements at the western sill of the Sicily Straits show that, while 137Cs concentration in the surface water entering the eastern Mediterranean remained constant (approximately 3.5 mBq/l) in the period 1993-1997, its level in the Levantine intermediate water leaving the basin decreased from 3.5 to 2.0 mBq/l.

Diets enriched with olive, rapeseed, or sunflower oil affect postprandial factor VII differently. 	"The incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in Crete was lower than expected on the basis of blood lipid concentrations of participants in the Seven Countries Study. A favorable effect of a high intake of olive oil on thrombogenesis may have contributed to this finding. We compared the effects of virgin olive oil with those of rapeseed and sunflower oils on blood coagulation factor VII (FVII), a key factor in thrombogenesis. In a randomized and strictly controlled crossover study, 18 healthy young men consumed diets enriched with 5 g/MJ (19% of total energy) olive oil, sunflower oil, or rapeseed oil for periods of 3 wk. On the final day of each period, participants consumed standardized high-fat meals (42% of energy as fat). Fasting and nonfasting blood samples were collected after each period. Mean (+/-SEM) nonfasting peak concentrations of activated FVII (FVIIa) were 11.3 +/- 5.1 U/L lower after olive oil than after sunflower oil, an 18% reduction (P &lt; 0.05). Olive oil also tended to cause lower FVIIa peak concentrations than did rapeseed oil (mean difference: 8.6 U/L, a 15% reduction; P = 0.09). There were no significant differences between diets with respect to nonfasting factor VII coagulant activity (FVII:c), prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) concentrations, or with respect to fasting plasma values of FVII protein, FVII:c, FVIIa, F1+2, or TFPI. A background diet rich in olive oil may attenuate the acute procoagulant effects of fatty meals, which might contribute to the low incidence of IHD in Mediterranean areas."

A 5-year study.	Greece is a country with an intermediate prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Crete, the third-largest island of the Mediterranean sea, has a different prevalence of viral hepatitis. One-eighth of the total island population, of 550,000, was included in a 5-year study of blood donors from three out of four blood banks, serving three out of four prefectures of the island. Markers for HBV and HCV were studied and evaluated according to geographical area, gender and age of donor. A total of 65219 blood donors were studied. A greater number of males than females were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive (0. 41% vs 0.28%, respectively) with a peak at a younger age for males and older age for females. Males are more frequently exposed to HBV and become carriers more often than females. For HCV, an opposite gender trend was found, females being infected more frequently (0. 49%) than males (0.37%). Statistical differences were found among geographical areas of the island. Hence, Crete is an area of low endemicity for HBsAg in blood donors. The HCV infectivity is more similar to Northern Europe than to other neighbouring countries. Differences in geographical distribution within the island and during different years indicate the need for extended epidemiological surveys for valid results.

To examine the effects of a health and nutrition intervention, implemented in primary schools of Crete, on health knowledge, nutrient intakes and physical activity of the intervention population. The intervention group consisted of 24 schools while the control group consisted of 16 schools. The overall duration of the intervention was six years, while the topics of the intervention primarily focused on children' dietary habits, physical activity and fitness. After the completion of the intervention period, the changes observed in health knowledge, nutrient intakes and physical activity were in favour of the intervention group pupils. The encouraging findings of the study indicate the potential of the programme in health promotion and disease prevention without involving substantial new school resources and time.

During the last decade, a considerable amount of new information has accumulated regarding therapy optimalization of renal anaemia with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO). Key question involved is EPO hyporesponsiveness caused by absolute or functional iron deficiency. Most controversial issue in the treatment of renal anaemia in patients with chronic renal insufficiency is the definition of optimal target haemoglobin. Many questions about optimizing EPO therapy were considered at the 2nd European Epoetin Symposium which was held in April 1998 on Crete. Discussion was devoted also to revision of a draft version of the European Best Practice Guidelines for the Management of Anaemia in Patients with Chronic Renal Failure. The presented review is on summary of new insights presented at the symposium. (Ref. 85.)

A clinical and ERCP registry over eight years. 	Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is an infrequent tumor that can be diagnosed, early. Twenty-four patients with histologically proven carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater were retrospectively studied and their data were analyzed. Most common presenting symptoms were jaundice (67%), weight loss (58%), fever and pain (54%). Endoscopic biopsies which were taken in 19 patients revealed carcinoma or dysplasia in 15 patients and were normal for in the rest. Twelve patients were treated with a Whipple's resection, 5 with local resection, 2 with palliative surgery and 2 received a stent endoscopically. During a mean follow-up period of 25 months, (range 1-82) 12 deaths were noted, and one patient was lost during follow-up. Presenting symptoms, endoscopic and histological findings were similar as in other series. The contribution of duodenoscopy, ERCP and endoscopic biopsy is essential for diagnosis but endoscopic biopsies may be misleading.
PMID:10651959	Maraki S, Tselentis Y	Int J Dermatol. 39(1):21-4	2000	Survey on the epidemiology of Microsporum canis infections in Crete, Greece over a 5-year period.	Microsporum canis is a frequent cause of tinea capitis and tinea corporis in Europe and especially in the Mediterranean area. Objective This study was undertaken to examine the epidemiologic features of all cases of M. canis infections recorded in Crete, Greece, during a 5-year period (1994-1998). The epidemiology of 111 cases of dermatophytoses due to M. canis was analyzed according to the sex, age, origin of the infection, place of residence, body site affected, and seasonal progression. M. canis constituted 24.5% of all dermatophytes isolated during the study period. Women were more frequently affected than men (54%), and infections were most prevalent in patients up to the age of 9 years (46.8%). Cats were identified as the commonest source of the infection (82%). As regarding the place of residence, most of the infected patients came from rural areas (64.9%). The commonest sites of M. canis infection (in decreasing order of frequency) were: the head, the lower extremities, the trunk, and the upper extremities. The greatest number of cases were seen in September and December. The findings of the present study indicate that M. canis infections have gradually decreased in recent years in this geographic area. Eradication requires elimination of the natural source of the infection, represented mainly by stray animals.

To investigate the prevalence of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in a randomized sample of the inhabitants of the island of Crete. In 18 different villages in all four prefectures of the island of Crete, patients were randomly selected from 1993 through 1998, and an in situ study was accomplished. The sampling fraction (covered by the 1991 census) in each village was approximately 5%. Patients were considered to have POAG when the morphologic aspect of a glaucomatous optic disc was present, and/or a nerve fiber layer defect and a visual field defect was present. The presence of Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PEXG) was also investigated. The prevalence of glaucoma in Crete was 2.80%. Of those diagnosed with POAG, 9.67% had an intraocular pressure (IOP) under 21 mm Hg, and 25.80% had PEX. The prevalence of simple ocular hypertension without glaucoma was found in 6.58% of the patients. The ratio of subjects with hypertensive glaucoma to those with simple ocular hypertension was 1:2.6. The prevalence of POAG and exfoliation glaucoma appears to be quite high in Crete. Further research will be needed to set more accurate criteria for earlier diagnosis and to enable more efficient organization of the health care system.
PMID:10788350	Danovaro R, Serresi M	Appl Environ Microbiol. 66(5):1857-61	2000	Viral density and virus-to-bacterium ratio in deep-sea sediments of the Eastern Mediterranean. 	Viruses are now recognized as a key component in pelagic systems, but their role in marine sediment has yet to be assessed. In this study bacterial and viral densities were determined at nine deep-sea stations selected from three main sites (i.e., the Sporades Basin, the Cretan Sea, and the Ierapetra Trench at depths of 1,232, 1,840, and 4,235 m, respectively) of the Eastern Mediterranean. The three areas were characterized by different phytopigment and biopolymeric carbon concentrations and by changes in the protein and carbohydrate pools. A gradient of increasing trophic conditions was observed from the Sporades Basin (North Aegean) to the Ierapetra Trench (South Aegean). Viral densities (ranging from 1 x 10(9) to 2 x 10(9) viruses ml of sediment(-1)) were significantly correlated to bacterial densities (n = 9, r(2) = 0.647) and reached values up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than those generally reported for the water column. However, the virus-to-bacterium density ratio in deep-sea sediments was about 1 order of magnitude lower (range of 2 to 5, with a modal value of 2.6) than in pelagic environments. Virus density decreased vertically with depth in sediment cores at all stations and was below detection limits at the 10-cm depth of the abyssal sediments of the Ierapetra Trench. Virus density in the sediment apparently reflected a gradient of particle fluxes and trophic conditions, displaying the highest values in the Sporades Basin. The low virus-to-bacterium ratios and their inverse relationship with station depth suggest that the role played by viruses in controlling deep-sea benthic bacterial assemblages and biogeochemical cycles is less relevant than in pelagic systems.

The Cretan experience. 	Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been recently utilised in the diagnosis and management of thoracic diseases. In this report we reviewed our VATS experience for biopsy of diffuse or localised lung diseases in 51 cases focusing on indications, operative procedures, complications or failures rates. Over the last 5 years we performed 51 VATS procedures for diagnostic purposes in 32 men and 19 women. The specific indications for VATS were lung biopsy for undiagnosed diffuse or localised lung disease. In all patients the postoperative pain was controlled with the use of non-narcotic analgesics and was measured according the visual analogue scale (VAS). There was no operative mortality. Postoperative non-fatal complications were seen in 3 cases (6%). The overall median duration of chest tube drainage was 2 days and the mean postoperative stay 3 days. In the diffuse lung disease a tissue diagnosis was obtained in all the cases. Conversion to thoracotomy was needed in 1 case (2%), owing to extensive adhesions. All patients expressed a postoperative pain control effect of less than 50% of VAS. VATS should be considered as a safe and effective procedure, with low postoperative pain and morbidity. Should be recommended in patients who require a histological diagnosis of diffuse or localised lung diseases.

Using plant material collected from the field and subsequently cultivated in the glasshouse, the basis of variation in a number of chemical parameters observed in Salvia fruticosa has been examined. It was shown that clones from three populations collected from different parts of Crete and previously found to exhibit different essential oil yields and profiles maintained these differences during cultivation. They were found to differ also in morphology and habit, phenolic yield and composition and different nitrogen-utilizing capacity as estimated by nitrate reductase activity. Some clones had very high levels of rosmarinic acid. The population with the highest essential oil yield had the lowest phenolic content and vice versa, but within populations there were clones with high levels of both.

"Cypress trees are among the most famous trees of the Mediterranean region. The origin of Cupressus sempervirens is apparently in the East Mediterranean. A nice description of the site of origin of Cupressus was provided by the Roman philosopher Plinius: ""cypress trees sprout spontaneously on Mt. Ida on the island of Crete, whenever the soil there is disturbed"". The aesthetic shape of the trees, the quality of their timber and their adaptation to harsh environmental conditions has attracted people. Certain varieties of the tree (e.g., var. Pyramidalis) were spread rapidly all over the Mediterranean and since the 16th century were introduced into the Western Hemisphere and other parts of the world. During historical times, Cupressus sempervirens was so widely used in the East Mediterranean countries that it reached the brink of extinction. Nowadays it is planted on a large scale as an ornamental plant as a windbreak and as a forest tree. Such plantations have various impacts on their environment, many positive ones, some negative ones, and some disastrous ones. This last aspect is where cypresses come in."
PMID:10821051	Sørensen JM, Katsiotis ST	Planta Med. 66(3):245-50	2000	Parameters influencing the yield and composition of the essential oil from Cretan Vitex agnus-castus fruits. 	Mature and immature fruits of a Cretan Vitex agnus-castus L. population were chosen to investigate different parameters such as comminution, maturity, distillation period and extraction method influencing the essential oil yield and composition. The effect of the comminution and the maturity of the plant material showed highly significant differences in yield and composition of the essential oils obtained, as well as the distillation duration from one to five hours and the method applied (hydrodistillation and simultaneous distillation extraction). The variation of 36 essential oil components due to the parameters applied was studied. The results showed that many different essential oil qualities can be obtained from the same plant material according to the parameters employed in its extraction. Entire fruits hydrodistilled for one hour yielded an oil much richer in monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds whereas the best combination to obtain an oil rich in less volatile compounds is by SDE of comminuted fruits for five hours. For mature fruits the main components varied as follows due to the parameters studied: sabinene 16.4-44.1%, 1,8-cineole 8.4-15.2%, beta-caryophyllene 2.1-5.0%, and trans-beta-farnesene 5.0-11.7%.

The Greek study in General Practice. 	"A seroepidemiological study was carried out in 15 primary health care (PHC) centres in rural Greece to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the surgeries of Greek General Practitioners (GPs) and to further clarify the transmission of hepatitis C in Greece. Serum samples were obtained from 1961 subjects (1259 females) aged &gt;/= 15 years, who visited GP surgeries between July 1996 and February 1997 in 15 PHC centres located in three large Greek regions (Macedonia, Attika and Crete). Subjects who participated in the study fulfilled the following criteria: history of blood transfusion; hospital admission of &gt; 7 days' duration without surgical or other intervention; use of intravenous drugs (current or previous); or women with a history of medical or paramedical abortion. Nearly 65% (1263 subjects) of the participants in this study reported hospital admission with a length of stay &gt; 7 days. Antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) were found in 67 participants (3. 5%), 41 of whom were females and 44 of whom were aged &gt;/= 61 years. The highest prevalence (4.8%) of anti-HCV was found in Crete, and differences among the Greek regions were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). Multivariate statistical analysis showed that in addition to regional differences, the following variables had a statistically significant effect on the prevalence of anti-HCV: history of dental surgery; use of intravenous drugs; hospital admission for &gt; 7 days; and the high consumption of alcoholic drinks. Hence there is a significant variability in the prevalence of hepatitis C in well-defined PHC areas of Greece. Several risk factors for acquiring HCV infection have been identified. Screening for HCV risk factors may enable Greek GPs to identify HCV-infected patients."

The use of DNA in forensic science has become a basic tool for person identification or parentage testing. The use of polymorphic markers permits the formation of a unique profile for each individual. The knowledge of allele frequencies in a given population allows the scientist to estimate the probability of a particular allele combination. For this task, allele databanks are essential. In this report, the authors estimate the frequencies of eight polymorphic markers (namely, HumFES, HumF13A1, HumTHO1, HumVWA, HumFABP2, HumLIPOL, D1S80, and D17S5) in a randomly selected sample from Crete, Greece. The allele profile of all markers, with the exception of D17S5 and HumFABP2, concurs with previous reports and international data.

To report on the body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and sum of skinfolds in a cohort of Cretan children and identify the factors associated with these indices. The present study was a follow-up study. Children were measured prospectively at ages 6, 9 and 12. Pupils came from 40 schools randomly selected from the 541 primary schools in three different provinces of Crete. 1046 pupils were examined at age 6. At age 9, a representative sample from the original cohort (n=579) was randomly selected for re-evaluation. At the age of 12, a sample of 831 pupils was re-examined, following similar procedures. Both during baseline and each subsequent follow-up, data were obtained on pupils' anthropometry, serum lipids, dietary intake, physical fitness and physical activity as well as their dietary and their health knowledge. Data on parents' anthropometry, age, occupation, educational level, and issues relating to health habits, attitudes and knowledge were also collected. Half of the obese children at age 6 were also obese at age 12. Cretan children had higher mean BMI than similar American cohorts. Compared to their American counterparts, Cretans had higher proportions of overweight in both genders across all ages tested. The endurance run test (ERT), an index of physical fitness, was positively associated with obesity indices. Sum of skinfolds related positively to serum LDL-C. Children from urban areas had higher skinfold sums than children from rural areas. Parental health-related hedonism related positively to children's BMI. It appears that these findings offer some support to the reported increasing prevalence of obesity among Greek children. Higher ERT, presumably reflecting higher physical activity, is associated with lower obesity. The relationship between degree of fatness and LDL-C appears to be evidenced at an early age in life. This relationship may relate to the reported VLDL and cholesteryl ester transfer protein elevations in obesity. The parental attitude of health-related hedonism appears to be linked with children's adiposity.

"Twelve populations of the epiphytic bryophyte Leucodon sciuroides from three major regions representing formerly glaciated and nonglaciated regions of Europe were screened for polymorphisms at 15 putative isozyme loci. The populations clustered into three distinct groups consisting of: (i) a single population from Crete, representing a cryptic unknown taxon; (ii) four Scandinavian populations and two populations from northern Greece; and (iii) the remaining populations from mainland Greece and Crete. The Scandinavian populations were genetically depleted compared with most Greek populations, thus fitting the expectation of generally lower levels of variation in formerly glaciated areas. The transition zone between genetically diverse and depleted populations appears to be located through northern Greece, coinciding with the northern limit of the Mediterranean region. This indicates that genetic variation was lost in populations at the northern limit of glacial refugia. The two groups of populations fit a progenitor-derivative model. They also have contrasting reproductive strategies: the Mediterranean populations reproduce sexually, whereas the other populations propagate vegetatively. Epiphytic species, growing on substrates that are limited in space and time, appear to be especially vulnerable to loss of genetic variation. Lack of genetic variation and therefore low adaptability to increased levels of atmospheric pollution may explain why many epiphytic lichen and bryophytes, including L. sciuroides, are declining over much of Europe."

A review and analysis of 210 cases.	A foreign body aspiration in the tracheobronchial tree is a dangerous and common medical emergency in childhood, with serious and potentially lethal consequences. It must be suspected in children with a suggestive history, even though the clinical symptoms or radiographic findings are not pathognomonic for foreign body aspiration. In this study 210 pediatric cases, with a suggestive history of foreign body aspiration undergoing bronchoscopy in the last 8 years in the department, were reviewed. In all cases bronchoscopy was performed under general anesthesia using a Storz ventilation bronchoscope with distal cold light illumination. In 130 patients a foreign body was discovered, in 17 cases pus was aspirated and in 63 cases there were no findings. Seventy-eight (60%) foreign bodies were found in the right main bronchus, 43 (33.1%) in left main bronchus, seven (5.4%) in both bronchi and two (1.5%) were found in the subglottic area. The incidence of bronchoscopy during the last 8 years was 28 procedures per 100000 children population per year in the island of Crete. More attention should be given to the need for a careful history and the use of radiographs as supplemental information to make the decision to perform a bronchoscopy. The parents, also, should pay attention not to allow children dry fruits and small toys, as well as, teaching their children to avoid any physical or emotional activity while having a full mouth.

In the present study samples of cannabis plants presented to us by the Drug Enforcement Units were characterised, based on the analysis of active substances. The fresh samples were dried in a dark room were they were kept until analysis. The samples included leaves, flowers roots and trunks. The analysis was performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography (GC) using standard solutions of cannabidiol, D-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, D-8 tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol. Chemical analysis of the flowers revealed that 80% of the plants were classified as resinous phenotype while the remaining 20% were found to be of the textile phenotype (low concentration of active cannabinoids). The concentration of D-9 tetrahydrocannabinol in the flowers and leaves ranged from 0.014 to 21.06 mg/g, of cannabinol from 0.0002 to 0.350 mg/g and of cannabidiol from 0.03 to 29.6 mg/g. Roots and trunks contained very small quantities of active substances and should not be used for phenotype identification. No delta-8 THC was detected in any sample. Leaves gave less resinous phenotypes than flowers. The use of either mathematical formula, A or B produced the same phenotype character for each separate part of the plant.

The present study aimed to estimate current nutrient intake levels and food group consumption patterns in Greece using cut-off levels derived from the results of dietary recall interviews with 470 Cretan adults. It was found that the present-day Greek diet contains, in the main, adequate levels of fibre. In comparison with the traditional diet, however, the levels of saturated fat in the diet have greatly increased, particularly in younger adults. An association was found between low fruit and vegetable and low fibre intake and a fat intake that was mainly in the form of saturated fat, this being particularly evident in female subjects. Given the wide availability of olive oil, fish, fresh fruit and vegetables in Greece, the development of national dietary guidelines would be of great potential benefit, particularly to the younger generations.

Of all transforms of an eye, aberrations are significant when higher visual acuity is to be achieved. Ray tracing aberrometry developed by the Institute of Biomedical Engineering (Kiev) and first tested at the Vardinoyannion Eye Institute of Crete is a promising technique for eye refraction aberration and refraction mapping. The technique uses measurement of the position of a thin laser beam projected onto the retina. The beam is directed into the eye parallel to the visual axis. Each entrance point provides its own projection on the retina. A set of entrance points forms a set of projections. From these data, a refraction map is reconstructed as well as a point spread function of the eye. The total time of scanning over the whole aperture of the eye is within 10 to 20 ms and depends on the number of test points at the eye entrance, as well as on the number of independent measurements in each point. Configuration of the scanning pattern can be chosen by the operator. It may contain 60 to 400 points, each checked 1 to 5 times. Preliminary studies showed high reproducibility of results. Twenty pseudophakic eyes were subjected to 30 consecutive measurements each. Ninety-five percent of all measured values were within +/-0.20 D of declination from the mean. Ray tracing aberrometry is a flexible technology for eye investigation. It can be adapted to any laser technique of vision correction Its further development should be oriented on laser-linked applications of the refraction driven refractive surgery.

In refractive surgery, measuring the total ocular profile of refraction gives more vital information than measuring the cornea alone. We report the first clinical experiments with spatially resolved refractometry using ray tracking principles. Tracey technology was developed in Ukraine by the Institute of Biomedical Engineering in cooperation with the Vardinoyannion Eye Institute of Crete. The Tracey-1 device was evaluated in comparison with conventional videokeratoscopes. Seven pseudophakic eyes of 7 patients and two phakic eyes were measured thirty (30) consecutive times (consecutively) each to test reproducibility. Measurements were provided in zones 0 to 5 (6) mm. For each zone, parameters of astigmatism were calculated and mean value and standard deviation were derived. Standard deviation on the order of 0.14 D was derived. The Tracey Technology wavefront device provides information on the refraction distribution at the first principal plane of the ocular optical system. For the instrument to provide measurements that are directly applicable to clinical practice, the data should be transposed to the corneal plane. The Tracey device can be utilized for the measurement of accommodative amplitude and range. Further development of the instrument is requred to increase its accuracy.

PMID:11035463	Tzimis L, Kafatos A	Public Health. 114(5):393-7	2000	Drug utilization and nutrition patterns among children from indigent and emigrant families in Crete, Greece. 	"To examine pharmaceutical needs, prescribed drugs, knowledge about pharmacotherapy and dietary patterns among indigent children. 101 children (&lt; or =18 y old), typically poor, from low-income families and emigrants coming back home from other countries, registered under Social Care in Chania, Crete. The control group comprised 81 Social Security insured children (&lt; or =18 y old). The length of the study was from January 1995 to December 1997. The socio-demographic profile of the Social Care children reveals a no schooling rate of 9.7% vs 0% of the control group. The most common disease diagnosed in the indigent children was bronchitis (18.5%) compared with respiratory infection (14.6%) in the control group. Tuberculosis was diagnosed in 2.0% of the Social Care indigent children and in none of the insured children. The most frequently prescribed drug category in both groups as Defined Daily Doses (D.D.D.) was for the respiratory system (32.4% vs 21.2%), while antibiotics were the most expensive (41.6% in the indigent vs 54.9% in the control group). Only 27.4% of Social Care indigent patients, versus 51.2% of insured patients, understood the instructions regarding the proper use of their drugs. Regarding the dietary patterns, significant differences were found in the consumption of breakfast every day (73.7% vs 87.7%), red meat &gt; or =4 per week (0% vs 6.3%) and fruits often (60.1% vs 75.0%). The present study emphasises the need for more information on drug use and the necessity for a continuing health educational intervention among indigent children."

Information about the epidemiology of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in southern Europe is very limited and especially in Greece non-existent. Our study sought to determine the current epidemiology of acute UGIB (incidence, mortality and case fatality) in the prefecture of Heraklion-Crete. From February 1998 to February 1999, we prospectively obtained data on all patients with acute UGIB in the prefecture of Heraklion-Crete. All patients who were permanent residents of the prefecture of Heraklion, aged 16 years and over with acute UGIB were included in the study. During this period, 353 cases of acute UGIB were included in the study. The overall incidence of acute UGIB is 160/100,000 adults per year with a male-to-female ratio of 1.7 and a mean age 66.2 +/- 17.1 years. The incidence rises from 30 in those aged under 30 years to 609 in those aged over 75 years. The overall population mortality was 9/100,000 adults per year. Overall case fatality during hospitalization was 5.6%. All deaths occurred in patients older than 60 years. One or more comorbid illnesses were noted in 61% of cases. Recent intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was reported in 49% of the cases. The most common recorded diagnoses were erosive disease in 108 (30.5%) patients, duodenal ulcer in 97 (27.4%) and gastric ulcer in 75 (21.2%). Rebleeding occurred in 41 patients (12%). Twelve patients (3.3%) had surgery during hospitalization. The overall annual incidence of acute UGIB in the prefecture of Heraklion-Crete is one of the highest reported in Europe and increases appreciably with age. Both population mortality and case fatality are slightly lower compared to those reported in most previous studies.

Mycetoma is a localized primary subcutaneous infection due to fungi (eumycetoma) or aerobic actinomycetes (actinomycetoma). We report a patient who acquired an implantation infection on the forefoot following a motorcycle accident in Crete. Both Sporothrix schenckii and Nocardia asteroides were isolated simultaneously from the lesion. Under combined therapy with itraconazole and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole for 7 months the lesion healed completely. A combination of causative organisms in mycetomas is rare, and the combination of S. schenckii and N. asteroides together has not been reported from one lesion.

To describe the traditional diet of Crete and evaluate the nutrient composition of 3 types of diet common in Crete by means of chemical analyses of composite food samples. To compare results with dietary analyses from a nutrient database developed at the University of Crete, Greece. Three composite diet samples were obtained based on 7-day weighed food records representing the traditional Cretan Mediterranean diet (diet A), typical diet of present-day Greek adolescents (diet B), and fasting diet of the Eastern Orthodox church (diet C). Analyses were performed chemically and using a nutrient database. Chemical analyses provided a definitive measure, for the first time, of the nutrient composition of the complete Greek diet as it was in the early 1960s. In comparing chemical analyses with nutrient database analyses, differences greater than 15% of the analyzed value were found in all 3 diets for cholesterol and some vitamins. The differences between analyzed and calculated values in total fat and saturated fat content were less than 15% in all diets. The present study provides 2 practical examples of the Mediterranean diet, which although widely publicized has rarely been analyzed chemically. Diet A has been shown to be related to the lowest rates for coronary heart disease and cancer mortality compared with the diets of the other populations of the Seven Countries study. As such, it could be recommended for health promotion and prevention of disease. Diet C contains even lower amounts of saturated fatty acids and would be excellent for patients with hypercholesterolemia. The high antioxidants in diet C probably maintain very low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Dietary analyses of the Greek diet could be based on an operational database such as ours if further chemical analyses are performed on specific foods. These would result in improved precision of the database and possible extension into national food composition tables and a national dietary database.

(Archie) Cochrane was born in 1909 into a wealthy Scottish family, from which he inherited the advantage of a private income and the disadvantage of porphyria. Though a brilliant student, his medical training was interrupted by a lengthy psychoanalysis in Europe, and by service in a field ambulance unit in the Spanish Civil War. Eventually Cochrane qualified in medicine in 1938 and joined the R.A.M.C. in 1939. He was taken prisoner in Crete in 1941 and served the rest of the war as medical officer in various POW camps. Cochrane's post-war career with the Medical Research Council as a field epidemiologist in South Wales earned him the respect and admiration of a generation of British epidemiologists. However, Cochrane's international reputation is not based on his achievements as an epidemiologist, but on his 1971 monograph ""Effectiveness and Efficiency. Random Reflections on Health Services,"" a biting scientific critique of medical practice. Cochrane died in 1988, but his name lives on in the Cochrane Collaboration, a network of researchers devoted to clinical trials, and the torch which he lit had been carried forward by the groups promoting evidence-based medicine. Some have looked askance at these developments, regarding them as a threat to the autonomy of physicians."

"Sequences of the cytochrome b (cyt b) mitochondrial gene show that the spiny mouse Acomys from Crete, known as the endemic species A. minous, is composed of two distinct maternal lineages (""A"" and ""B""). Group ""A"" sequences cluster with A. nesiotes (Cyprus) and group ""B"" sequences cluster with A. cilicicus (Turkey), which is evidence of paraphyly of A. minous in regard to these two species. From cyt b sequences, the three taxa are very closely related to A. cahirinus (Egypt): the maximum divergence found among these sequences is 1.6%, which is equivalent to the intraspecific diversity observed in other Acomys species. Paleozoology evidenced that man unintentionally introduced Acomys into Crete and Cyprus during antiquity. The divergence time between Acomys cyt b sequences found in Crete was estimated at 0.4 Myr, which means that the diversity observed did not appear after the introduction but reflects a much more ancient polymorphism. Cytochrome b phylogeny and cytogenetic data together comprise evidence that, within the species A. dimidiatus (Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt), it is the karyotypic form with 36 chromosomes that derives from the form with 38 chromosomes, due to a single acrocentric fusion."

To access the safety and effectiveness of Double-J-stents in treating symptomatic hydronephrosis during pregnancy. From 1994 to 1999, 21 women were hospitalized in the Urology Clinic at the University Hospital of Crete. Fourteen patients presented acute pyelonephritis, six painful hydronephrosis and one spontaneous renal rupture. In four cases the hydronephrosis was caused by calculus in the upper 3rd quadrant of the ureters. In 13 out of 14 cases of urinary febrile infection and one with spontaneous renal rupture, the dilatation resulted from direct compression of the ureters by the gravid uterus. Using ultrasound guidance, 21 ureteral stents were successfully placed under local ane- sthesia. In 14 out of 21 patients with urinary infection, we observed remission of fever during the first 24 hours after the placement of the ureteral stents. In the patient with spontaneous renal rupture the remission of symptoms was observed a few hours after the ureteral drainage. Complications were reported in six cases, such as, voiding symptoms and discomfort. Double-J-ureteral stenting is an effective, simple and safe method in treating symptomatic hydronephrosis during pregnancy.

(Nematoda: Longidoridae) from a vineyard infected with a foliar 'yellow mosaic' on Crete, Greece. 	A description is provided of Longidorus cretensis n. sp., a bisexual species associated with grapevines in Crete, Greece. The species is characterised by a body length of 6.3-8.7 mm, head flattened anteriorly and continuous with the body profile, amphids pocket-shaped and not bilobed, a posteriorly situated guide-ring, posteriorly situated oesophageal glands, and a tail bluntly rounded to hemispherical. Xiphinema index was present throughout the vineyard, but L. cretensis n. sp. occurred only in an area where the grapevine foliage exhibited a 'yellow mosaic' disease, and in association with X. pachtaicum from the rhizosphere of an olive tree growing adjacent to the vineyard. Nematode-transmitted virus was not recovered from weed species growing in the vicinity of the olive tree, or by bait-testing soil collected from the rhizosphere of the tree. Population densities of L. cretensis n. sp. were similar under olive and grapevine, but twice as many adult specimens were recovered from soil samples collected in the vineyard. Three quarters of L. cretensis specimens were present at 21-40 cm depth under olive, whereas a similar proportion of the population was equally distributed under grapevine at 21-40 cm and 41-60 cm depths.

"We aimed to investigate the short-term respiratory effects of heavy, occupational wood smoke exposure among traditional charcoal production workers. A total of 22 charcoal workers (mean age, 41 years; 9 current smokers, 5 ex-smokers, and 8 nonsmokers) were studied and compared with a control group of 35 farmers residing in Perama, Rethymnon, Crete. The charcoal workers were exposed to wood smoke for an average of 14 h/d during a mean of 23.7 days required for the burning of kilns. The workers under study were found to have significantly more cough (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 19.7), sputum production (OR, 6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 26.5), wheezing (OR, 7.7; 95% CI, 1.4 to 41.5), dyspnea (OR, 28.7; 95% CI, 5.4 to 153), and hemoptysis (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 0.7 to 55) than the control group. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum production, wheezing, and dyspnea in the charcoal workers was significantly elevated during the exposure period (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 17.7; OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1 to 31; OR, 9.8; 95% CI, 1 to 88; and OR, 36.7; 95% CI, 1 to 327, respectively). The mean +/- SD percent of predicted values of FVC, FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC ratio, and forced expiratory flow at 25 to 75% of FVC during the exposure period were significantly lower than those before exposure: 106 +/- 10.8 vs 101 +/- 11.9, p &lt; 0.01; 104 +/- 16 vs 97 +/- 15, p &lt; 0.001; 81 +/- 9 vs 78 +/- 8, p &lt; 0.001; and 95 +/- 27 vs 80 +/- 25, p &lt; 0.01, respectively. The mean +/- SD value of peak expiratory flow at midday and in the evening during the exposure were significantly lower than before: 524 +/- 131 L/min vs 548 +/- 108 L/min, p = 0.03; and 521 +/- 135 L/min vs 547 +/- 131 L/min, p = 0.02, respectively. Our results suggest that wood smoke exposure in charcoal workers is associated with increased respiratory symptoms and decreased pulmonary function. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine potential long-term adverse respiratory effects."

We determined the availability of poisoning antidotes in the pharmacies of state hospitals in Greece and in Health Centers of the island of Crete. A questionnaire survey was sent to all pharmacy directors of hospitals with emergency departments, asking them to report anonymously the amount currently in stock of each of 12 common antidotes. Questionnaires were sent to 100 pharmacy directors and 68 (68%) of them replied. Only 2 (3%) of the 68 hospitals stocked all 12 antidotes. The percentage of sufficient stocking for individual antidotes ranged from 6% (for digoxin immune fab) to 91% (for methylene blue). Recent circulation of government guidelines for antidote stocking and hospital type had no significant effect on antidote stocking. In a multiple regression analysis, hospital type (prefectural, regional, university hospital) and smaller hospital size were not predictors of the number of antidotes sufficiently stocked. Storing of key poisoning antidotes is inadequate in regional as well as in prefectural hospitals in Greece. Antidotes, including those which should be used without delay to be effective, are often not available, even for the commoner poisons in Greece such as pesticides.

The prevalence of urine leakage and care-seeking rates of women 35-75 years of age who visited GPs in two rural areas of Crete were investigated. All the women who visited their family physician in two primary care units during the period of August to November 1997 (N = 251) were asked if they had experienced symptoms of involuntary urine leakage. A set of questions was addressed to the women who replied positively. Sixty-nine of the 251 women (27.5%) reported symptoms of involuntary urine leakage, and among the incontinent women 11 (15.9%) had previously contacted the health services about their problem. Only six out of thirty (20%) of the incontinent women who report effects on household activities, social and sexual life had contacted a physician about urinary incontinence (UI). The most common reason reported for not consulting the physicians was that the symptoms were not considered serious (35 women out of 58, 60.3%). This study points out the need for further awareness programs for both women and healthcare professionals to be set up in countries like Greece, in which a low care-seeking rate of incontinent women has been reported.

Susceptibility to 14 antibiotics was determined for 125 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae collected over a 3-year period in Crete, Greece. Twenty-three isolates (18.4%) showed intermediate resistance and 15 (12%) high-level resistance to penicillin. Erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and sparfloxacin resistance rates were 16.8, 10.4, 19.2, 24.8 and 9.6%, respectively. Multiple resistance was observed in 22 strains. Vancomycin and levofloxacin were the most active agents tested. The most prevalent serotype among penicillin-susceptible pneumococci was 14, followed by 9, 7 and 1, while among penicillin-intermediate or -resistant strains serotype 23 was predominant followed by 19 and 9. These results show that as well as a high level of penicillin resistance in this region, some strains are also resistant to other antibiotics and may show multi-drug resistance.

Hepatitis C is a serious problem on the Greek island of Crete, where a high prevalence of antibodies against hepatitis C (anti-HCV) has recently been reported. This article reports the findings of a study carried out in Crete, which investigated the prevalence of serum autoantibodies in patients with chronic hepatitis C. One hundred and forty two patients (59 men and 83 women), who were found anti-HCV seropositive in two hospitals and two Primary Health Care Centres in Crete, were eligible. Sixty healthy blood donors (46 men, 14 women), which were negative to anti-HCV, were used as the control group. They were randomly selected from those attending Rethymnon Hospital. Autoantibodies were identified using the indirect immunofluorescence (IFL) technique on human epithelial cells from larynx cancer (HEp-2 cells), rat liver-kidney-stomach substrate (CT3) and Chrithidia Luciliae (CL). Serum autoantibodies were detected in 104 HCV patients, yielding an overall prevalence of 73.2%. The most frequent autoantibodies were antinuclear antibodies (ANA), positive in 72 patients (50.7%). Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) were detected in 33 patients (23.2%). Only one patient was positive for LKM1 autoantibodies. No autoantibodies were found in 38 patients (26.7%). Autoantibodies were also found in 5 out of the 60 examined healthy blood donors (8.3%). Autoantibodies, mainly ANA and ASMA are very common in HCV seropositive patients from Crete. By contrast LKM1 autoantibodies are exceptionally rare in these patients.

"Western Europe is a reinvasion zone for the riverine dragonfly genus Calopteryx (Insecta: Odonata). Reinvasion may have been from central West Asia or from the West Mediterranean refugium. Phylogenetic relationships of West Mediterranean and West European taxa of the genus Calopteryx from different localities were inferred from sequences of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) of the nuclear ribosomal RNA genes. Twenty-six taxa belonging to the species groups C. splendens, C. meridionalis, C. haemorrhoidalis, C. virgo, C. xanthostoma, and C. exul were analyzed, with two North American species, C. amata and C. aequabilis, as outgroup. Sequence data and phylogenetic analyses were used to infer biogeographical patterns. The ribosomal spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and the intervening 5.8S rDNA gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced. The ITS2 sequences of the West Mediterranean and West European calopterygids show no length variation but the ITS1 region was slightly variable in length. The sequence variation for ITS1 and ITS2 regions between different West Mediterranean and West European calopterygids was 14.5 and 6.1%, respectively. Phylogenetic relationships inferred from ITS sequences only partly confirm morphological data. A monophyletic origin of all West Mediterranean and West European species emerged. They are separated into two main clades; the splendens-like forms and the virgo/meridionalis/haemorrhoidalis group. Intraspecific variability, indicating different stages of speciation, was detected only in West Mediterranean representatives (e.g., C. xanthostoma) but not in invasive representatives in West Europe. The North African endemic C. exul is more closely related to the Italian C. s. caprai than to C. splendens sensu strictu. Based on the present information, Cretan populations are the only splendens-like taxa in addition to C. s. caprai that deserve subspecies status."

"Since the spring of 1997, when the Neurology Department of the University Hospital of Crete admitted its first patient, nine cases (eight neuropathologically confirmed and one probable) of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) have been recorded. This represents an annual incidence five-fold higher than expected based on the island's population (0.54 million). Molecular analysis of the prion-protein gene (PRNP) showed no mutations in any of the seven CJD cases studied. Five patients (ages 64-88 years) were homozygous for methionine-129 of PRNP and showed the classic sCJD triad (subacute dementia, myoclonus, periodic electroencephalogram). Brains contained type 1 (unglycosylated 21.5 kDa band) protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres). Two patients (ages 56 and 57 years), both homozygous for valine-129, showed cerebellar ataxia and later dementia not associated with periodic electroencephalogram; brain PrPres was type 2. Genotyping of 205 Cretan controls showed that methionine-129 homozygosity, a susceptibility factor for sCJD, was significantly higher in this population than in other Caucasian populations (57.0% n = 205 vs. 41.5% n = 859, p &lt; 0.0001). These data are the first to relate a high regional incidence rate for sCJD to the distribution of PRNP 129 genotypes in the local population; however, additional factors may be operational."

In July 1998, a telemedicine link was established between the Venizelio General Hospital in Crete and the Paediatric Cardiology Department of the Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital in Athens. The telemedicine link used ISDN at 384 kbit/s for diagnosis, management and education in congenital heart disease. Over 18 months, a total of 39 teleconsultations were carried out, concerning 93 children with haemodynamically significant cardiac abnormalities. Forty-four children (47%) were managed locally after teleconsultation, while three children with transposition of the great arteries (3%) were transported as emergency cases to Athens in the first days of life. The other 46 children (50%) had a scheduled appointment at a tertiary centre for cardiac catheterization, angiocardiography, operative treatment or surgical repair. The telemedicine link brought a number of benefits, such as better access to the tertiary centre and the avoidance of patient transportation.

"This is a preliminary report of an outreach mammographic-screening programme on Crete. The screening is part of a study to test if occupational exposure to pesticides in greenhouses (mainly organophosphates and organocarbamates), may increase the risk of malignant or premalignant findings in mammographic examination. A total of 1062 women (aged 40--75 years) were recruited between 1988 and 1993 and followed-up until 1998: 522 worked for at least 10 years in greenhouses for more than 4 h daily (exposed), and 540 never worked in agriculture (non-exposed). Statistics include detection rates and relative risks of mammographic findings. 'Exposed' women had a significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher risk than 'non-exposed' for fibroadenoma, ductal hyperplasia, sclerotic adenosis, fibrohyperplastic disease, cystic disease and inflammatory mastitis. There were no significant differences in the detection rates of fibrocystic changes, lipoma and malignant changes or malignant tumours. Compared with older women (aged 50--75 years), younger women (aged 40--49 years), particularly in the 'exposed' group, had a higher detection rate of malignant tumours. These preliminary results indicate that 'exposed' women may have higher risks of incidence for a number of lesions, which are risk markers for subsequent invasive breast cancers. They confirm also that early screening for breast cancer is effective and provides an opportunity for a reduction in breast cancer mortality."

"To assess the level of knowledge for bronchial asthma of the primary healthcare physicians serving a rural population on the island of Crete, both before and immediately after a one-day educational course. Twenty-one primary health care physicians, randomly selected from a list of 14 Health Care Centres on the island of Crete were invited to participate in the study and attended an educational course. Nine of the 21 physicians were fully qualified general practitioners, while the remainder were non-specialized (NSs) physicians who had recently graduated from the University of Crete, Medical School. A questionnaire of 20 items based on current bronchial asthma clinical guidelines was used. Three scores, the mean total, knowledge subscore and attitudes subscore, were calculated for each group of physicians, both before and after the course. At baseline mean total score and knowledge and attitudes subscores were higher for non-specialized physicians than for the general practitioners, but the differences were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). The knowledge subscore was improved in both groups, however the difference was statistically significant only for the non-specialized physicians (t = 2.628, d.f. = 11, p &lt; 0.05). The mean total score after the course was significantly higher for the non-specialized physicians in comparison to that of the general practitioners (t=-2.688, d.f. = 19, p &lt; 0.05). This study adds to the information about the success of continuing medical education, and also demonstrates that the recent graduates in the studied population, could be educated with more positive results than the fully qualified practitioners"

"While a number of studies have been performed in the United States, northern Europe, and some other countries on the epidemiology of large bowel polyps and diverticulosis, information from southern Europe and especially Greece is very limited. Our autopsy study sought to determine the prevalence of large bowel polyps and diverticulosis in the population on Crete. Specimens of colon and rectum were obtained during forensic postmortem autopsies and examined for the presence of polypoid lesions and diverticulosis. Data were collected from a total of 502 autopsies (320 men, 182 women; median age 65 years (range 16-93). Polyps were found in 106 cases (21.1%). These were adenomas in 73 cases (14.5%), hyperplastic polyps in 25 (4.9%), and mucosal tags in 8 (1.5%). Diverticulosis of the large bowel was found in 115 (22.9%). The prevalence of adenomas and diverticulosis increased with advanced age. The prevalence of colonic diverticulosis in Crete is slightly lower than that which has been reported in most other studies in economically developed countries. The prevalence of colorectal adenomas in Crete is one of the lowest rates reported in Europe and is compatible to the known low incidence of colorectal cancer in Crete."

"The detection of terrestrial-sized extrasolar planets from the ground has been thought to be virtually impossible due to atmospheric scintillation limits.  However, we show that this is not the case especially selected (but nevertheless main sequence) stars, namely small eclipsing binaries.  For the smallest of these systems, CM Draconis, several months to a few years of photometric observations with 1-m-class telescopes will be sufficient to detect the transits of any short-period planets of sizes &gt; or = 1.5 Earth radii (RE), using cross-correlation analysis with moderately good photometry.  Somewhat larger telescopes will be needed to extend this detectability to terrestrial planets in larger eclipsing binary systems.  (We arbitrarily define ""terrestrial planets"" herein as those whose disc areas are closer to that of Earth's than Neptune's i.e., less than about 2.78 RE.)  As a ""spin-off"" of such observations, we will also be able to detect the presence of Jovian-mass planets without transits using the timing of the eclipse minima.  Eclipse minima will drift in time as the binary system is offset by a sufficiently massive planet (i.e., one Jupiter mass) about the binary/giant-planet barycenter, causing a periodic variation in the light travel time to the observer.  We present here an outline of present observations taking place at the University of California Lick Observatory using the Crossley 0.9-m telescope in collaboration with other observatories (in South Korea, Crete, France, Canary Islands, and New York) to detect or constrain the existence of terrestrial planets around main sequence eclipsing binary star systems, starting with CM Draconis.  We demonstrate the applicability of photometric data to the general detection of gas giant planets via eclipse minima timings in many other small-mass eclipsing binary systems as well."

The purpose of this study was to apply European Commission reference dose levels (EC RDLs) to routine CT examinations. The dosimetric quantities proposed in the European Guidelines (EG) for CT are weighted computed tomography dose index (CTDI(w)) for a single slice and dose-length product (DLP) for a complete examination. Patient-related data as well as technical parameters for brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis examinations were collected for four CT scanners in the Euromedica Medical Center. Computed tomography dose index (CTDI) measurements were performed on each scanner and CTDI(w), DLP and effective dose E were estimated for each type of examination for a random sample of 10 typical patients. Mean values of CTDI(w) had a range of 27.0-52.0 mGy for brain and 13.9-26.9 mGy for chest, abdomen and pelvis examinations. Mean values of DLP had a range of 430-758 mGy cm for brain, 348-807 mGy cm for chest, 278-582 mGy cm for abdomen and 306-592 mGy cm for pelvis examinations. Mean values of E were 1.4 mSv for brain, 10.9 mSv for chest, 7.1 mSv for abdomen and 9.3 mSv for pelvis examinations. Results confirm that the Euromedica Medical Center meets EC RDLs for brain, abdomen and pelvis examinations, in terms of radiation dose and examination technique. As far as chest examination is concerned, although CTDI(w) of each scanner is within proposed values, the DLP is consistently exceeded, probably because of the large irradiation volume length L. It is anticipated that a reduction of L, or product mAs, or their combination, will reduce DLP without affecting image quality.

"A fundamental requirement for achieving continuity of care is the seamless sharing of multi-clinical information. Several different technological approaches can be followed to enable the sharing of health record segments. In all cases interoperability between systems is a prerequisite and this requires presently a major technological challenge. Inter-operability can be achieved either through messages or through a more advanced approach based on a federation of autonomous systems. Message based integration is centered mainly on the exchange of HL7 and DICOM messages for achieving the functional integration of clinical information systems (CIS) at institutional or regional level. The federated approach is principally used for facilitating the virtual view of the Integrated Electronic Health Record (I-EHR), without having to replicate unnecessary information. Within the context of HYGEIAnet, which is the regional health telematics network of Crete, both approaches have been utilized for providing end users with seamless access to clinical information. Both are based on an open architecture, which provides the framework for the reuse of standardized common components and public interfaces. This work presents the experiences related to the implementation of ""messaging"" and ""federating"" in HYGEIAnet, which are used complementary to each other. A comparison of the two parallel approaches, together with their strengths and weaknesses is described, and evaluation is given from the technological as well as the end users' perspective. Emphasis is given on the technological challenges in developing open, component-based information infra-structure to support integrated service delivery."
PMID:11619266	Bournova E	Ann Demogr Hist (Paris). 119-36	1996	[Public health and medical corps in transition: the case of Crete at the beginning of the 20th century].	This article deals with the transformation of the public health system in Crete at the turn of the century, when the island was placed under the protection of the European Powers. Cretan archives, especially those from the town of Rethimno, provide a wealth of information on this subject. They show that the new ruling powers, with the declared objective of safeguarding their soldiers, required local authorities to keep a close watch over epidemics, indeed to lock up populations considered dangerous for public health, such as lepers and prostitutes--who did not fail to put up a strong resistance. While providing equipment for hospital facilities, which were still primitive, the Powers also introduced legislation concerning the practice of medicine, from which Muslim Cretans were gradually excluded. The rate at which medical care was provided increased markedly at the beginning of the twentieth century, in particular in the principal towns. The Rethimno notarial archives reveal that this new and well qualified medical corps belonged to the world of prominent citizens, and while ministering to the town's health needs, they held considerable political and economic power. 
PMID:11694649	Simopoulos AP	J Nutr. 131(11 Suppl):3065S-73S	2001	The Mediterranean diets: What is so special about the diet of Greece? The scientific evidence. 	"The term ""Mediterranean diet,"" implying that all Mediterranean people have the same diet, is a misnomer. The countries around the Mediterranean basin have different diets, religions and cultures. Their diets differ in the amount of total fat, olive oil, type of meat and wine intake; milk vs. cheese; fruits and vegetables; and the rates of coronary heart disease and cancer, with the lower death rates and longer life expectancy occurring in Greece. Extensive studies on the traditional diet of Greece (the diet before 1960) indicate that the dietary pattern of Greeks consists of a high intake of fruits, vegetables (particularly wild plants), nuts and cereals mostly in the form of sourdough bread rather than pasta; more olive oil and olives; less milk but more cheese; more fish; less meat; and moderate amounts of wine, more so than other Mediterranean countries. Analyses of the dietary pattern of the diet of Crete shows a number of protective substances, such as selenium, glutathione, a balanced ratio of (n-6):(n-3) essential fatty acids (EFA), high amounts of fiber, antioxidants (especially resveratrol from wine and polyphenols from olive oil), vitamins E and C, some of which have been shown to be associated with lower risk of cancer, including cancer of the breast. These findings should serve as a strong incentive for the initiation of intervention trials that will test the effect of specific dietary patterns in the prevention and management of patients with cancer."

There is a controversy as to the relative importance of obesity vs quality of dietary fat in the prediction of serum lipoproteins in children. A reason for this is an apparent lack of studies implementing biomarkers of long-term dietary fat intake among children. The objective of the present study was to assess the relative contribution of degree of obesity, fat centrality, and quality of adipose tissue fat in the prediction of serum lipids in 12-year-old children. Pupils came from 40 schools randomly selected among 541 primary schools in three different provinces of the island of Crete. One thousand forty-six pupils were examined at age 6. At age 9, a representative sample from the original cohort (n = 579) was randomly selected for reevaluation. At the age of 12, a representative sample of 831 pupils was reexamined. At ages 6, 9, and 12, serum lipid measures were obtained from 941, 458, and 791 children, respectively. At age 12, data were obtained on pupils' anthropometry, serum lipids, dietary intake, physical fitness, and physical activity. Adipose tissue fatty acid data were obtained from a subsample of 194 children at age 12. Regression analyses indicated that children's serum triglycerides related positively to body mass index and waist-hip ratio (WHR). Serum HDL-C related negatively to WHR and positively to endurance run test, an index of physical fitness. Dietary fatty acids, assessed by a single administration of 3-day weighed-food records, did not relate to serum lipids. However, serum HDL-C related negatively to sum of adipose polyunsaturated fatty acids, a measure of long-term polyunsaturated fat intake. It appears that obesity and fat centrality are stronger predictors of children's serum lipids than the quality of long-term dietary fat intake or adipose tissue fatty acid composition. It is possible that this finding may relate to the particular subcutaneous depot studied. It is suggested that future studies study abdominal rather than buttock adipose tissue fatty acid composition in relation to children's serum lipid levels.

The sharing of information resources is generally accepted as the key to substantial improvements in productivity and better quality of care. In addition, due to the greater mobility of the population, national and international healthcare networks are increasingly used to facilitate the sharing of healthcare-related information among the various actors of the field. In the context of HYGEIAnet, the regional health telematics network of Crete, an Integrated Electronic Health Record environment has been developed to provide integrated access to online clinical information, accessible throughout the island. To make available comprehensive medical information about a patient by means of incorporating all the distributed and heterogeneous health record segments into an Integrated Electronic Health Record that can be viewed on-line through a unified user interface and visualization environment. The technological approach for implementing this Integrated Electronic Health Record environment is based on the HYGEIAnet Reference Architecture, which provides the necessary framework for the reuse of services, components, and interfaces. Seamless presentation of information is achieved by means of the Extensible Markup Language (XML), while its underlying capabilities allow for dynamic navigation according to personalized end-user preferences and authorities. The Integrated Electronic Health Record environment developed in HYGEIAnet provides the basis for consistent and authenticated access to primary information over the Internet in order to support decision-making. Primary information is always kept at the place where it has been produced, and is maintained by the most appropriate clinical information system, contrasting traditional store and forward techniques, or centralized clinical data repositories. Since documents are much more easily accessible rather than data inside a database, Extensible Markup Language has the potential of becoming a very cheap technology provided, of course, that the underlying Healthcare Information Infrastructure exists. XML can be introduced incrementally and its implementation is completely transparent to the end user.

Urban-rural differences in the prevalence of atopy and associated allergic diseases have been reported in several non-European countries. Within Europe, where such variations are less striking, a farm childhood has been postulated to be protective. We aimed to compare the prevalence of atopy in urban and rural children living in Crete and to examine the role of early exposure to a farming environment in explaining any measured differences. A cross-sectional survey of children attending secondary schools in Iraklion, the capital city, and five villages 100 km to the south. Atopy was determined by the responses to skin prick tests with seven common aeroallergens. Nine-hundred and ninety-seven children participated in the survey. 19.6% of those living in Iraklion, but only 9.6% of those from the villages, had a positive response to one or more skin prick tests. Among urban children there were significant gradients in the prevalence of atopy across several categories of animal contact and consumption of farm (unpasteurized) milk products--before the age of 5 years. These differences, however, were not apparent among the rural children.

Thrombophilia in inflammatory bowel disease may be due to several risk factors, such as a dysbalanced haemostasis with a hypercoagulative state, thrombocytosis, hyperfibrinogenaemia and hyperhomocysteinaemia. In addition, increased concentrations of lipoprotein (a), a modified form of low-density lipoprotein particles, have been associated with a higher risk of thrombotic vascular disease, probably due to inhibition of (local and endothelial) fibrinolysis. The mechanisms regulating the plasma concentration of lipoprotein (a) have not yet been elucidated completely, but genetic factors are involved. Dietary factors seem to play a minor role. In this issue of the journal, Koutroubakis et al. report that lipoprotein (a) concentration is elevated in patients with Crohn's disease, but not in patients with ulcerative colitis. Several other (apo)lipoproteins have a different pattern in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in a control population of healthy subjects from Crete. These findings add up to the multifactorial nature of thrombophilia in inflammatory bowel disease patients, especially in patients with Crohn's disease, and give rise to speculations about the clinical significance of the observed different lipoprotein metabolism in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

The essential oil of leaves and peel from the Cretan variety Zambetakis (Citrus limon) was obtained by steam distillation with a Clevenger apparatus. The essential oil was subjected to GC-MS analysis, and 35 substances were identified. The main component in both essential oils was limonene. beta-Pinene, myrcene, neral, geranial, neryl acetate, geranyl acetate, and beta-caryophyllene have been identified in the leaf oil. The peel oil contained gamma-terpinene, beta-pinene, myrcene, neral, and geranial. The quantification of volatile substances was based on the internal standard method, using octyl acetate as internal standard, and expressed in milligrams per kilogram of the essential oil. The high contents of neral and geranial were indicative of the high quality of both essential oils. The aroma profile and quantitative variations among the essential oil components were measured at six different time intervals over a period of greater than one year. Differences between the components of lemon leaves and peel were observed.

Singapore's elderly population has been growing rapidly and is expected to constitute more than 25 percent of the total population by the year 2030. The ageing process brings with it a host of health problems. Here the question arises--Are the increasing years of life going to create a high proportion of sick and disabled elderly people, or a rich human resource of healthy senior citizens? Since more women are living longer than men, who would face a higher risk of disability and handicap? These questions are yet to be answered in Singapore. This paper seeks answers to these questions. The study is based on a sample survey of 1209 elderly Singaporeans living in Kampong Glam, Kreta Ayer and Bukit Merah parliamentary constituencies which have some of the highest proportions of the aged population. The results revealed that more than half of the aged had a disability and the rate of disability was significantly higher among the women as compared to the men. More than one-third of the elderly had a handicap and the rate of handicap among the women was twice as much as that among the men. Severity of handicap was directly correlated with age.

"This analysis aims at describing all-cause mortality and their determinants in 16 cohorts of middle-aged men of eight nations. A total of 12,763 men aged 40-59 years were enrolled in the late 1950s and early 1960s in 16 cohorts located in the USA, Finland, The Netherlands, Italy, Croatia, Serbia, Greece and Japan. The highest death rates were found in Slavonia-Croatia, due to high rates of infectious diseases and violence (death rate of 610 per 1000), and in East Finland due to high rates from coronary heart disease (death rate of 597 per 1000). The lowest death rates were found in a highly educated group in Belgrade, Serbia (death rate 295 per 1000) and in Crete, Greece (death rate 314 per 1000). The ecological analysis showed no significant relationship between mean risk factor levels and all-cause death rates except for the direct association with systolic blood pressure during the first 15 years follow-up. Individual multivariate analysis on eight national pools showed that age, systolic blood pressure, and smoking habits are direct, significant, and universal long-term predictors of all-cause mortality. Serum cholesterol, physical activity and body mass index were so only in some areas. Multivariate coefficients were similar across nations. Pooled hazards ratios were 1.55 for a difference of 5 years of age (CI: 1.51-1.59); 1.23 for 10 cigarettes smoked per day (CI: 1.20-1.26); 0.91 for one unit (based on three grades) of physical activity score (CI: 0.87-0.95); 1.04 for 1 mmol/l of serum cholesterol (CI: 1.02-1.07); and 0.93 for three units of body mass index (CI: 0.91-0.96). In conclusion some cardiovascular risk factors predict long-term risk of all-cause mortality in different cultures."

My main field-work in Sardinia was supported by the Social Science Research Council, London and the University of Reading/Berks, and the ones in Corsica, Malta and Sardinia by the Department of Ethnology, University of Cologne (Institut für Völkerkunde, Universität Köln) forming a part of a project on the Mediterranean of which I was in charge. The above research was also related to my M.A. Course on ""Mediterranean Peasant Societies and Social Structures"" taught at the Graduate School of European and International Studies, University of Reading between 1978-1994. The main purpose of the article is to demonstrate the role of the islands in the Mediterranean, especially their ability in preserving their identity in spite of many incursions from outside. Islands became symbolized by their systems of values, and the ability to survive any attempt of conquest or change. In this the islands received a great help in the environment which helped these islands to remain unique and isolated until the present day."

"So far the prevalence of viral hepatitis infection in hospitalized patients has not been extensively studied. Therefore we conducted the present five-year observational study to evaluate the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection in high-risk hospitalized patients of Crete, the largest Greek island, Due to the homogeneous population, epidemiological studies can be accurately done. The study was carried out in two out of four District General Hospitals, and in the University Hospital of the island. Markers for HBV and HCV were studied and statistically evaluated according to age, sex and geographical area, in a well-defined hospitalized population. The total prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HCV in the three prefectures during the five-year study is 2.66% and 4.75% respectively. Overall the relative risks were higher in males than females for each hepatitis marker (p &lt; 0.001). Higher prevalence of HBcAb was found in the 41-60 years age group for both sexes (males 36.17%, females 27.38%). Peak HBsAg prevalence was found in the age group of 21-40 and 41-60 years for males (5.4%) and females (3.09%) respectively. Anti-HCV prevalence increases with age reaching the highest prevalence in the age group of 41-60 years for males (7.19%) and in the 61-90 years age group for females (7.16%). For both sexes significant differences between the three locations were identified. For HBsAg a higher prevalence in Heraklion (3.96%) compared to Chania (2.30%, males: p &lt; 0.0001, females: p &lt; 0.05) and Rethymnon (1.45%, males: p &lt; 0.01, females: p &lt; 0.0001) was detected. For HCV a significantly higher prevalence in Heraklion (6.54%) compared to Chania (2.39%, males: p &lt; 0.001, females: p &lt; 0.001) but not in Rethymnon (5.15%, NS). A lower prevalence rate of HBcAb in Heraklion compared to Chania (20.07% versus 23.05%, males: p &lt; 0.001, females: p &lt; 0.001) was found. These results were possibly overestimated, but nevertheless reflect the situation of the general population within the island as shown by our previous publications in other study groups. Moreover they contribute to the mapping of viral hepatitis prevalence in a geographical area of Southern Europe and may be helpful in planning public health interventional strategies."

A polymorphism (M129V) at codon 129 of the prion protein gene (PRNP) results in either a methionine residue (Met) or a valine residue (Val) and is known to determine susceptibility for the development of sporadic or acquired Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The distributions of M129V genotypes and alleles in various general populations have been reported and there are clear differences between Western Europeans and East Asians. We analysed the coding sequence of the PRNP gene in 100 healthy Turkish subjects to determine whether the distributions of the M129V genotypes and alleles or other PRNP gene variants in the Turkish population differ from those in other normal populations. Three known polymorphisms but no other gene variants were detected in the PRNP coding sequence of the Turkish individuals. Genotype frequencies at codon 129 were 57% Met/Met, 34% Met/Val and 9% Val/Val, with an allele frequency of 0.740:0.260 Met:Val. These distributions are considerably different from those reported for other normal populations residing in Western Europe and East Asia, except in Crete. The higher frequency of 129 Met-homozygotes in Turkey than in Western Europe suggests that the Turkish are at greater risk of developing CJD.

Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is an important outcome measure in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The aim of our study was to assess HRQoL in a population of 135 Greek patients with IBD. A cohort of 135 patients with IBD, 81 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 54 with Crohn's disease (CD) were enrolled in our study. Demographic and disease-related data were recorded. HRQoL was assessed by a disease-specific and a generic questionnaire, IBDQ and SF-36, respectively. Disease activity was assessed by Harvey-Bradshaw Index and the Colitis Activity Index for CD and UC patients, respectively. Among all variables recorded in our study, only disease activity had a significant effect on HRQoL. Patients with active disease scored significantly lower on both IBDQ and SF-36 when compared to those in remission. Only two among the four IBDQ dimensions, bowel and systemic, had significant ability in distinguishing best patients in remission from those with active disease. IBD has a negative impact on HRQoL. Patients with active disease are more impaired than patients in remission. In our population of patients bowel and systemic dimensions had a predominant value in patients' perception of quality of life. Patients in our study using the same instrument scored higher than previously reported.

"The aim of this study was to present epidemiological results relating to malignant neoplasms of breast using primary data from the island of Crete, Greece, 1994-1995. The patients were all female residents of Crete with breast cancer first diagnosed during 1994 and 1995, 208 and 207 new incident cases, respectively. The data were collected and analysed by the Cancer Registry of Crete (CRC). Direct age-standardised rates (ASR) for incidence and cumulative risk (to age 75 years) were calculated for Crete as a whole. Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated for the 20 provinces (administrative regions); these were also smoothed using Bayesian methods. The ASR for incidence per 100000 person-years was 70.6. The truncated rate (age 40 years and above) was 153.7. The SIR for the 20 provinces showed no marked variations, with three exceptions, two of which had ratios higher than 1 and one lower. Bayesian smoothing of provincial incidence rates showed that throughout Crete, the risk of breast cancer shows considerable uniformity. The incidence rate of breast cancer on Crete is higher than that of Greece overall, and is comparable with other southern European countries. A possible explanation is that the published incidence for Greece may be an underestimation of the true rate. The small variability in breast cancer incidence within Crete probably reflects the homogeneity of the population and environmental and social conditions."

Exogenous administration of surfactant is nowadays considered to be the treatment of choice. In this paper we attempt a comparison of clinical results from the administration of natural Alveofact and synthetic Exosurf surfactants in premature newborns with respiratory distress syndrome. The study subjects were 92 premature newborns who had been hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, of the University of Crete. A total of 42 subjects received synthetic surfactant and 50 subjects received natural surfactant. The surfactant was administered in one to three doses, depending on respiratory support requirements. The time of administration was a little longer for the natural surfactant group. The duration of mechanical ventilatory support, requiring oxygen, the duration of hospitalization and the percentage of increase of arterial alveolar partial pressure oxygen ratio (a/APO2) were slightly higher for the synthetic surfactant group. The mortality rate during the neonatal period (28th day) was higher for the synthetic surfactant group than for the natural surfactant group (38.1 vs 24%). A similar tendency was noticed also as regards to complications, e.g. pneumothorax (11.2 vs 5.2%; relative risk (RR) 0.27) intraventricular hemorrhage (34.6 vs 21.1%; RR 0.61), septicemia (11.5 vs 5.2%; RR 0.46) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (12.5 vs 2.8%; RR 0.22). The use of natural surfactant seems to offer more advantages in comparison with its synthetic counterpart."

"An increased prevalence of coeliac disease in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis has been recently reported. However, in other studies the association has not been confirmed. There have been no formal attempts to systematically evaluate patients with autoimmune cholangitis for coeliac disease. Sera from 62 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 17 with autoimmune cholangitis and 100 blood donors were screened for anti-gliadin, anti-endomysial, anti-reticulin, and IgA class antibodies to guinea pig liver-derived tissue transglutaminase. Eighteen untreated coeliacs served as methodological controls. Analyses were performed by using the chi2 and Fischer's exact tests. Anti-gliadin antibodies were detected in 21% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 35% of patients with autoimmune cholangitis, and 3% of controls (p &lt; 0.001). IgA class gliadin antibodies positivity was more pronounced in patients with Scheuer's stage III-IV disease (p &lt; 0.05). Anti-transglutaminase antibodies were detected in 10% and in 18% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune cholangitis respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Anti-reticulin and anti-endomysial antibodies were negative in all patients. Duodenal biopsies were performed in 59% and 71% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune cholangitis respectively, tested positive for at least one antibody class. No histological features of coeliac disease were found. We were unable to demonstrate an increased risk of coeliac disease in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune cholangitis. Our results confirm the previously reported high prevalence of false-positive anti-gliadin and guinea pig liver-derived anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in patients with chronic liver disease."

"The chemical composition of the essential oils of twenty-five populations of Cistus creticus subsp. creticus L. from the island of Crete (Greece) and their interpopulation variability were analysed in detail by GC-MS. 142 compounds were identified representing an average of 56.8-89.8% of the oil composition. The components are represented here by homologous series of monoterpenes, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, labdane diterpenes, aldehydes, alkanes, esters, fatty acids, ketones, and others. Labdane diterpenes were detected and identified in the essential oils and have been found in high percentage composition. The results from the chemical analysis of the essential oils were submitted to chemometric cluster analysis in order to detect some pattern distribution and to identify which constituents can differentiate the groups of individuals. Two main chemotypes (clusters) were well differentiated; the first deals with eight populations of West Crete and the second with the rest of the populations. Cluster analysis based on labdane type diterpenes patterns, proved to be the best chemotype for the examined populations among the other chemical groups."

In this study, the diglyceride contents of 96 samples of virgin olive oils from the regions of Crete, Lesvos, Messinia, Pilion, Zakynthos, Halkidiki, and Ilia, 15 samples of commercial extra virgin and pure olive oils, and 3 samples each of refined olive oils and pomace oils were determined by a facile method introduced in a previous publication. This method is based on the phosphitylation of the free hydroxyls of the diglycerides with 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyldioxaphospholane and the integration of the appropriate peaks in the (31)P NMR spectra. This preliminary study showed interesting trends in the diglyceride content of the virgin olive oils from the various regions of Greece that can be used as simple criteria to assess the olive oil characteristics. Analysis of variance has been carried out for the diglyceride content of each region in an attempt to detect possible differences in the diglyceride levels among the various regions. Finally, the relationship between the ratio of 1,2-diglycerides to the total amount of diglycerides and the total amount of diglycerides has been used to monitor the quality of virgin olive oils, commercial olive oils, refined olive oils, and pomace oils.

The Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM) are far from the rare systemic diseases that mainly affect the neural tissue. There are very few written reports on ocular findings in subjects with IEM, thus it was interesting to study the frequency of ocular findings in the studied population and explore their contribution to the early diagnosis of IEM. Our study involved the evaluation of IEM suspected cases, which had been identified in a rural population in Crete, Greece. Over a period of 3 years, 125 patients, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this study, were examined. Analytical physical examination, detailed laboratory investigation as well as a thorough ocular examination were made. A diagnosis of IEM was established in 23 of the 125 patients (18.4%). Ten (43.5%) of the diagnosed IEM had ocular findings, while 8 of them (34.8%) had findings which were specific for the diagnosed diseases. One patient diagnosed with glycogenosis type 1b presented a rare finding. Of the 102 non-diagnosed patients, 53 (51.96 %) presented various ophthalmic findings, some of which could be related to a metabolic disease and therefore may be very helpful in the future. The ocular investigation can be extremely useful for raising the suspicion and the establishment of an early diagnosis of IEM. It could also add new findings related to these diseases. The early management of the ocular symptoms can improve the quality of life to these patients.

This supplement contains reports from a symposium on a novel approach to treat obesity, gastric myo-electrical stimulation, that was held at the IFSO in Greece in 2001. There were four presentations. Xavier Pi-Sunyer from Columbia University in New York discussed medical risks of obesity. Karl Miller from Austria presented technical aspects of the surgery. Valerio Cigaina from Italy, the originator of the concept, reviewed his 7-year results with this therapy. Finally, Jerome D'Argent from France gave his preliminary results employing higher energy electrical stimulation parameters. Customarily weight loss data are presented as percent excess weight lost (%EWL), an antiquated measurement, e.g. all subjects were purchasing life insurance, the poor and minorities were under-represented and those with heart disease, malignancies or diabetes were excluded. In this supplement weight loss data are presented in a novel manner: percent excess body mass index (BMI) lost %EBL. This innovation merits an explanation and justification. The NIH/NIDDK convened a panel, chaired by Professor Pi-Sunyer, that concluded that for adults a BMI of 25 should be considered the upper limit of normal. Accordingly, we have proposed that BMI units in excess of 25 be considered to represent 100% of the excess weight of an individual. The USA FDA has agreed to accept weight loss data presented as %EBL. The intriguing data presented justify further evaluation of this novel, potentially useful and relatively benign treatment of obesity.

This paper presents the various issues encountered in planning, designing, performing, and reporting pharmacoepidemiologic research. Five hundred and fifty-one indigent patients insured by Social Care visited the Hospital Pharmacy of Chania General Hospital, and were compared with 551 patients insured under Social Security funds who visited three community pharmacies. The study had no external funding. Before we started the study, we officially sought approval from the Scientific Committee of our Hospital and from the local Pharmaceutical Association. We asked also for approval from the Medical School of the University of Crete. Patient privacy was of great concern in the design and performance of the study. The law in Greece, according to the directives of European Union, affects the way we use records in hospitals and protect patient rights. After these studies were completed, we made proposals to the authorities concerning continuous health education for both patients and health workers. Pharmacoepidemiologic research is difficult in hospitals outside universities or institutions, because of the lack of adequate funding and grants to support research staff.

A prevalence study of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) was carried out in 14 of 112 Greek hospitals (15.7%), scattered throughout Greece. Five of seven Greek university hospitals and nine regional hospitals participated in the one-day study, and 3925 hospitalized patients (10.5% of the total hospital beds in Greece) were recorded. The aim of this project was to organize a surveillance of HAI with the participation of the greatest possible number of Greek hospitals, transferring the experience from the local Cretan infection control network in an effort to create a nationwide network. Special attention was paid to recruit all Greek university hospitals in our attempt to expand the study base. Co-ordination of the participating centres, education of the infection control teams on surveillance methods, preparation of agreed definitions, and elaboration of the protocol for the collection of the data were the major objectives of this study. The difficulties, however, were limited resources and the lack of skilled personnel. The overall prevalence of HAI was found to be 9.3%. The most common HAI recorded involved lower respiratory tract infections (30.3%), followed by urinary tract infections (22.7%), bloodstream infections (15.8%), and surgical site infections (14.8%). The greatest prevalence rate was found in the adult ICU (48.4%), followed by the neonatal ICU (30.3%). The duration of hospitalization, the number of operations, the total number of used devices and invasive procedures were significantly correlated with HAI. Positive cultures were found in 51.5% of the cases. The most frequently isolated micro-organisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.6%), Escherichia coli (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7.6%). The administration of antibiotics was also recorded. The prevalence of antibiotic use was 51.4%.

"Fifteen isolates of Verticillium dahliae (eight of race 1, seven of race 2; most from the island of Crete, Greece) were examined for isozyme and molecular variation. Among the isozyme banding patterns (zymograms) of six enzymes that were ""activity-stained"" after electrophoresis in 9% polyacrylamide gels, differences were observed in diaphorase, alpha-esterase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase; 2, 2, 3 and 5 different types of zymograms were recorded, respectively. The zymograms could not be correlated with either race 1 or 2. However, all six isolates originating from the Oropedio (plateau) area of Lasithi (Crete) showed an esterase zymogram clearly distinguishable from the other isolates. No differences were observed when staining for acid phosphatase or aspartate aminotransferase ('glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase'). Furthermore, electrophoresis of random-amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) in 2% agarose gels showed that three race-2 isolates from Oropedio of Lasithi could also be distinguished by the RAPD pattern generated with primer OPA-1. The variation observed possibly represents adaptation of V. dahliae to the Oropedio environment."

University hospital. A 29-year-old woman who developed progressive catamenial hemoptysis and secondary infertility was evaluated at the University Hospital of Crete. The complete history, laboratory data, laparoscopic findings, and chest magnetic resonance image of this patient were analyzed. A GnRH agonist, leuprolide acetate, was successfully administered. Diagnosis and appropriate treatment of pulmonary endometriosis in a patient with rudimentary uterine horn. Treatment with a GnRH agonist achieved suppression of both menstruation and hemoptysis. After 6 months of normal menstrual activity, the symptoms reappeared. The patient was again treated with leuprolide acetate (3.75 mg/mo IM) for 6 months and remained asymptomatic. In fact, the patient became pregnant after cessation of therapy. Finally, the patient was treated successfully with removal of the rudimentary uterine horn during cesarean section. Three-year follow-up showed disappearance of the chest symptoms. Pulmonary endometriosis and unicornuate uteri are rare. To our knowledge, this is the first case of catamenial hemoptysis with a congenital müllerian anomaly. We describe successful management using a combination of GnRH agonist and surgical resection of the rudimentary uterine horn.

A seroepidemiological study carried out in a high-risk village in Crete in 1985-1987 and 1998 showed that although the awareness of the people concerning zoonoses had increased during this period, the situation did not improve: there was a significant increase of the spread of seroprevalence in time and space of Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia typhi, Brucella sp., and Entamoeba histolytica. Toxoplasma gondii, Rickettsia conorii, Borrelia burgdorferi, Echinococcus granulosus, Leishmania sp., and Fasciola hepatica stayed at the same levels. This first study of Bartonella henselae in Crete showed that 15.9% of the children tested were seropositive. The results indicate that reservoirs and vectors of the pathogens studied are widespread in the environment, and the way of life of the people favors contact with them. Seven of 30 milk samples were positive for Brucella sp. by seminested polymerase chain reaction.

The objective of the present study was to study whether adipose tissue and prostatic tissue fatty acid composition differentiates between prostate cancer and benign hyperplasia patients. In addition, the present investigation aimed at exploring the extent to which prostatic tissue fatty acid composition differentiates between prostate-confined cancer and extraprostatic disease including possible metastasis. The subjects were 71 male patients from the island of Crete. Half the patients (n=35) had been diagnosed with benign hyperplasia of the prostate, half with prostatic malignancy (n=36). Patients were examined at the outpatient clinic of the urology unit, University Hospital, Medical School, University of Crete. Relative to benign hyperplasia patients, cancer patients had elevated adipose tissue saturated and reduced monounsaturated fatty acid levels. Cancer patients had reduced prostate tissue stearic to oleic acid ratios and stearic acid levels as opposed to hyperplasia patients. The most pronounced difference between cancer patients and hyperplasia patients was a 3-fold elevated prostatic palmitoleic acid in the former group. Relative to benign hyperplasia patients, cancer patients had reduced prostate tissue arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid levels. Finally, there was a significantly reduced omega-3/omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio in the prostate cancer patient as opposed to the benign hyperplasia group. The pronounced elevations in prostatic tissue palmitoleic acid in cancer patients highlight a possible role of this fatty acid in neoplastic processes. The decreased arachidonic acid levels in cancer patients possibly stem from enhanced metabolism of arachidonic acid via lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways, and the formation of derivatives such as 5-HETE, 15-HETE, 12(S)-HETE and PGE(2).

In the context of HYGEIAnet, the regional health telematics network of Crete, a clinical cardiology database (CARDIS) has been installed in several hospitals. The large number of resting ECGs recorded daily made it a priority to have computerized support for the entire ECG procedure. Starting in late 2000, ICS-FORTH and Mortara Instrument, Inc., collaborated to integrate the Mortara E-Scribe/NT ECG management system with CARDIS in order to support daily ECG procedures. CARDIS was extended to allow automatic ordering of daily ECGs via E-Scribe/NT. The ECG order list is downloaded to the electrocardiographs and executed, the recorded ECGs are transmitted to E-Scribe/NT, where confirmed ECG records are linked back to CARDIS. A thorough testing period was used to identify and correct problems. An ECG viewer/printer was extended to read ECG files in E-Scribe/NT format. The integration of E-Scribe/NT and CARDIS, enabling automatic scheduling of ECG orders and immediate availability of confirmed ECGs records for viewing and printing in the clinical database, took approximately 4 man months. The performance of the system is highly satisfactory and it is now ready for deployment in the hospital. Integration of a commercially available ECG management system with an existing clinical database can provide a rapid, practical solution that requires no major modifications to either software component. The success of this project makes us optimistic about extending CARDIS to support additional examination procedures such as digital coronary angiography and ultrasound examinations.

"To evaluate the effects of ultrasound examination of newborns in early detection and management of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), and its correlation to known risk factors. The incidence of DDH in newborns throughout the general population of Crete has also been investigated. From 1996 to 2000, 6,140 full-term newborns were examined in the Maternity Department of the University Hospital. All received standard assessments, with their medical history recorded, and a physical examination performed on the first and the fifth postpartum days. Ultrasonography of both hips using the Graf technique was performed on the 15th day after birth on both high-risk newborns and those with any clinical suspicion of DDH. Treatment was initiated according to the Graf classification. Ultrasound examination was performed on 220 newborns (3.58%). Ultrasound findings were positive in 65 neonates (10.83 per 1,000). Twenty-one neonates whose clinical examination was normal, but who underwent ultrasound because of the presence of risk factors had pathological findings on the hip sonography (32.30%) The incidence of DDH in Crete is estimated to be 10.83 per 1,000; higher than in the rest of Greece. Medical and family histories and clinical examination play an important role in the diagnosis of hip instability. Selective ultrasonography for all infants with risk factors, and those with clinical abnormality of the hip, is an adjunctive tool which aids early diagnosis and offers higher control in the results of treatment."

Of these cases, 4.8% were registered in 1993, 19.3% in 1994, 47.0% in 1995, 10.8% in 1996, and 18.1% in 1997. The greatest incidence of the disease occurred during the third trimester of the year. Direct contact with rats was noted in 45 (54.2%) of 83 patients. Two strains of Rickettsia typhi were isolated in cell cultures. The predominant clinical manifestations were: fever (100%), headache (88%), chills (86.7%), and rash (79.5%). In 4 of the patients (4.8%), the disease was complicated by acute renal failure, and in 4 other patients (4.8%), by pulmonary consolidations.

During the years 1995-1999 the life cycle category of 2797 clones of Myzus persicae (Sulzer) was examined. The clones originated from primary and secondary hosts from different localities of North and Central Greece and the island of Crete in the south. Four different overwintering life cycle strategies were found that have also been described for M. persicae and other heteroecious species previously. A geographical variation was found in the proportion of holocyclic clones from tobacco and other secondary hosts associated with the abundance of the primary host in the sampling regions. In Central Macedonia, around the main peach-growing regions, the proportion of holocyclic clones was mostly above 50% and in some cases reached 100%. In localities of East Macedonia, holocyclic clones were also frequent. On the other hand, further south or in north-eastern Greece, where peach is not common, the proportion of holocyclic clones varied between 0 and 33%. Fifty seven percent of examined anholocyclic clones produced males under short day conditions, suggesting that androcyclic clones in Greece represent an important factor of genetic variability. Intermediate clones were sampled from all host-plants but at low frequencies (3.6% of total examined clones and 6.9% of non-holocyclic ones). Moreover, a regional variation was found in different colour forms feeding on tobacco plants. Red clones were predominant in regions where aphids overwinter parthenogenetically on weeds or winter crops. However, almost all clones from the primary host were green. The ecological aspects of life cycle variation are discussed.

"The effectiveness of a health and nutrition education programme, in changing certain chronic disease risk factors, was assessed after the 6 years intervention period was completed. The school-based intervention programme was applied to all children registered in the first grade (age 5.5-6.5 years) in 1992 in two counties of Crete, while the children from a third county served as a control group. In order to assess the effectiveness of the intervention, a variety of biological and behavioural parameters were measured before and following completion of the intervention in a randomly selected school-based sample of 602 intervention group (IG) and 444 control group (CG) pupils. At the end of the 6-year period, it was found that biochemical indices generally improved significantly more in the IG compared with the CG (mean change for IG v. CG was -0.27 v. -0.12 mmol/l for total cholesterol (TC); -0.07 v. +0.24 for TC:HDL and -0.13 v. +0.14 for LDL:HDL). Similarly, the changes observed in the anthropometric variables in the two groups were in favour of the IG (+3.68 v. +4.28 kg/m2 for BMI; +2.97 v. +4.47 mm for biceps skinfold). Total energy intake and consumption of total fat and saturated fat increased significantly less in the IG compared with the CG (+747.7 v. 1534.7 kJ (+178.7 v. +366.8 kcal); +5.9 v. +18.8 g and +0.8 v. +5.1 g respectively), while time devoted to leisure time physical activity and cardiovascular run test performance increased significantly more in the IG (+281 v. +174 min/week and +2.5 v. +1.2 stages respectively). The findings of the present study underline the importance of such programmes in health promotion and disease prevention. Although the long-term effects of these programmes can only be assessed by tracking this population through to adolescence and adulthood, these programmes seem to have the potential to lead to a healthier lifestyle and thus a reduction in risk factor levels."

To consider the implications of these findings for current views on the nature and health implications of the traditional Mediterranean diet and how best to define it for use in modern policy making. A systematic review of the literature on food consumption in Greece. Greece. The first fully published data on the fat content of the Greek diet-the Seven Countries Survey-relates only to a small number of adult males in Crete and Corfu; the legitimacy of extrapolating these results to the rest of Greece is questioned. Earlier studies and chemical validation of intakes point to a lower fat content of the traditional diet than that inferred for Crete. Nearly all later surveys relate only to urban groups in Athens (mostly case-control hospital-based samples) and a variety of non-representative Cretan groups. Only two studies are larger and more representative, but one uses FAO food balance-sheets to reflect the national diet, and the other surveyed school-age children in three out of the 52 Greek counties. Unfortunately recent dietary studies have proved unreliable, given the continuing lack of national food composition tables with survey methods which proved inaccurate for dietary fat content. A progressive upward trend in total and saturated fat intake appears to have occurred with all health indicators in relation to fat indicating remarkable increases in adult and childhood obesity with attendant progressive deterioration in cardiovascular mortality and its risk factors, ie hypertension and diabetes. These data emphasise the need to alter current nutritional advice in Greece, particularly when it focuses on the promotion of olive oil and a high-fat diet. The findings reaffirm low-moderate fat policies for optimum health, within which olive oil can be an important component of the diet."

Pupils at twenty primary and ten high schools in Crete, Greece, were examined as part of a wider study of the dietary habits and health status of children and adolescents. A total of 1054 children participated: 583 9- to 12-year-olds and 471 14- to 16-year-olds. ""High"" and ""low"" Ca intake in each age group was defined using upper and lower Ca intake quartiles for each sex. Multiple regression techniques were used to examine associations after adjustment for energy intake. No statistical association was observed between calcium intake and serum lipoproteins, anthropometric measurements, or physical activity status. Energy-adjusted Ca intakes were positively associated with intakes of protein, saturated fatty acid (SFA), magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin A, and vitamin B2, whereas higher Ca intakes were associated with lower monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and omega-6 fatty acid intakes. In both age groups, pupils with high Ca intake had higher intakes of the food groups ""milk and milk products"" and ""grains and grain products"" than those with low Ca intake, although even ""high"" Ca intake in older female Cretan pupils (with a 75th percentile cut-off of 999 mg/day) may not be at adequate levels."

Pompia is an ancient name of a small community in Messara valley, which is the main agricultural area, in central Crete. The constructed wetland in Pompia is a free water surface (FWS) system, for treating the wastewater of the local community of 1,200 p.e. That wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is a pilot plant but it is simple, safe, innovative, and environmentally friendly. The WWTP was funded by the Region of Crete. The Eastern Crete Development Organization was responsible for the design, supervision, management, and initial operation. The project was completed in August 1999, and has been under operation since then.

The general sense for a visitor is that the FWS system operates like a natural marsh and a habitat of birds and wild animals. In addition, very high removal rates for BOD5, COD, TSS, TKN, TP, TC, and FC have been obtained.

To examine the effect of a low phenol olive oil and high phenol olive oil on markers of oxidation and plasma susceptibility to oxidation in normolipaemic smokers. Randomized single-blind cross-over trial with two intervention periods. The Medical School and University Hospital of the University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Twenty-five healthy males and females completed the study. Each intervention was of three weeks duration and intervention periods were separated by a two week washout. Seventy grams of extra virgin olive oil was supplied to each subject per day in the intervention periods. The olive oils supplied differed in their phenol content by 18.6 mg/day. Two fasting venous blood samples were taken at the end of each intervention period. The markers of antioxidant capacity measured in fasting plasma samples (total plasma resistance to oxidation, concentrations of protein carbonyl as a marker of protein oxidation, malondialdehyde and lipid hydroperoxides as markers of lipid oxidation and the ferric reducing ability of plasma) did not differ significantly between the low and high phenol olive oil diets. No effect of olive oil phenols on markers of oxidation in smokers was detected. It may be that the natural concentrations of phenols in olive oil are too low to produce an effect in the post-absorptive phase. Possible reasons for period effects and interactions between diet and administration period need attention to aid further cross-over trials of this kind.

Reducing the ratio between essential fatty acids: C18:2 n-6/C18:3 n-3 down to 5 is recommended by Nutritional Guidelines. We studied the fatty acid (FA) changes in consumers' plasma following changes in livestock diet. First, a zootechnical study introduced 5% of extruded linseed into the diet of livestock to replace other oleaginous ingredients, and on an iso-nutritional values basis. The products from linseed-fed animals contained more n-3 fatty acids (precursor alpha-linolenic and derivatives obtained by elongations and desaturations) than control animal products (issued from animals fed without linseed), and more conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). The n-6/n-3 ratio was reduced by 54% in butter, 60% in meat and 86% in eggs. Following this, a double-blind, randomised, cross-over clinical study involving 75 healthy volunteers compared plasma and erythrocyte FA profiles in consumers of animal products (from livestock fed the linseed diet or from livestock fed standard diet). It showed modifications in the FA composition of the experimental human regimen with more C18:3 n-3 (1.65 vs. 0.75 g/day), and more n-3 derivatives. The C18:2 n-6/C18:3 n-3 ratio decreased (7 vs. 15). In volunteers' plasma, C18:3 n-3 increased in the essay group (0.93 vs. 0.44% of the FA), so did n-3 derivatives and CLA. The n-6/n-3 ratio decreased from 14.3 to 10.2. In erythrocytes, C20:5 n-3 increased in the essay group (0.59 vs. 0.45%) and so did C22:6 n-3. The n-6/n-3 ratio decreased in parallel from 4.2 to 3.8. Without any changes in consumers' eating habits, foodstuffs from animals fed linseed diets induced significant modifications of human plasma and erythrocyte fatty acid composition (comparable to that noted under the 'Cretan' diet) and a sharp increase in CLA.

"To prospectively compare the influence of fornix-based and limbus-based conjunctival flaps on the final outcome and complications of 2-site phacotrabeculectomy with mitomycin-C in fellow eyes of patients with bilateral open-angle glaucoma (OAG). Glaucoma Unit, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Crete, Crete, Greece.Twenty-two patients with bilateral primary OAG and 8 patients with bilateral exfoliative glaucoma had 2-site phacotrabeculectomy in both eyes. Eyes were randomly assigned to the fornix-based flap or limbus-based flap group by the use of random tables. The intraocular pressure (IOP) decreased significantly in both groups (P &lt;.01); however, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the amount of IOP decrease or the number of postoperative antiglaucoma medications after a 1-year follow-up. Faster improvement in visual acuity was observed in the fornix-based group during the first week. The mean time of surgery was 3.5 minutes less in the fornix-based group. An increased incidence of fibrin exudation, pupillary membrane formation, and capsule opacification was found in eyes with exfoliative glaucoma. The early bleb leakage was 3 times more frequent in the fornix-based group. The type of conjunctival flap in a 2-site phacotrabeculectomy did not seem to influence the final outcome. The main advantage of the fornix-based conjunctival flap is the shorter surgical time and the relatively faster improvement in vision postoperatively. The main disadvantage is more frequent early bleb leakage."

"To explore the extent to which the reported unfavorable fatty acid content of abdominal depots in adults is also true for children. In addition, the present study aims to assess the relative importance of abdominal vs buttock adipose tissue fat in the prediction of serum lipid levels in children. A cross-sectional study of children from the island of Crete. The study was conducted between October 1999 and January 2000 in the Municipality of St Nikolas, Crete. A total of 475 children (aged 11-18) participated in the study. Data were obtained on children's anthropometry, serum lipids, physical activity and abdominal and buttock adipose tissue fatty acids. In total 138 children (aged 11-16) had complete data in all of the variables studied. Abdominal depots have elevated proportions of saturated fatty acids (P&lt;0.001) and trans fatty acids (P&lt;0.001), and reduced proportions of monounsaturated (P&lt;0.001) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (P&lt;0.001) in comparison to buttock depots. Buttock adipose tissue monounsaturated fat correlated negatively to serum LDL-C (P&lt;0.05). Abdominal adipose tissue polyunsaturated fat had negative correlations with serum total cholesterol (P&lt;0.05) and LDL-C (P&lt;0.05). Regression analyses indicated that children's serum total cholesterol (P&lt;0.05) and LDL-C (P&lt;0.05) were inversely related to abdominal adipose tissue polyunsaturated fat. Body mass index was positively related to serum triglycerides (P&lt;0.01) and LDL-C (P&lt;0.01), and negatively to serum HDL-C (P&lt;0.05). Age was negatively related to serum HDL-C (P&lt;0.05). It appears that, similar to adults, children's fatty acid composition of abdominal adipose tissue is less favorable than that of the buttock. Abdominal depots have elevated proportions of saturated fatty acids and reduced proportions of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat in comparison to buttock depots. Moreover, children's abdominal depots appear to have higher trans fatty acid contents than buttock depots. Children's adipose polyunsaturated fat, a biomarker of long-term polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, is inversely related to serum total cholesterol and LDL-C. It appears that abdominal adipose tissue fatty acids are more strongly related to serum lipids than buttock adipose tissue fatty acids. This may be attributed to the reported higher lipolysis rates in abdominal as opposed to buttock depots. Funding was provided by the Municipality of St Nikolas, Crete, Greece."
PMID:12445491	Mamalakis G, Tornaritis M, Kafatos A	Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids. 67(5):311-8	2002	Depression and adipose essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. 	The objective of the present study was to investigate the relation between adipose tissue polyunsaturated fatty acids, an index of long-term or habitual fatty acid dietary intake, and depression. The sample consisted of 247 healthy adults (146 males, 101 females) from the island of Crete. The number of subjects with complete data on all variables studied was 139. Subjects were examined at the Preventive Medicine and Nutrition Clinic of the University of Crete. Depression was assessed through the use of the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale. Mildly depressed subjects had significantly reduced (-34.6%) adipose tissue docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels than non-depressed subjects. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that depression related negatively to adipose tissue DHA levels. In line with the findings of other studies, the observed negative relation between adipose tissue DHA and depression, in the present study, appears to indicate increasing long-term dietary DHA intakes with decreasing depression. This is the first literature report of a relation between adipose tissue DHA and depression. Depression has been reported to be associated with increased cytokine production, such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, INF-gamma and INF-alpha. On the other hand, fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids have been reported to inhibit cytokine synthesis. The observed negative relation between adipose DHA and depression, therefore, may stem from the inhibiting effect of DHA on cytokine synthesis.

"A fundamental requirement for achieving continuity of care is the seamless sharing of multimedia clinical information. Different technological approaches can be adopted for enabling the communication and sharing of health record segments. In the context of the emerging global information society, the creation of and access to the integrated electronic health record (I-EHR) of a citizen has been assigned high priority in many countries. This requirement is complementary to an overall requirement for the creation of a health information infrastructure (HII) to support the provision of a variety of health telematics and e-health services. In developing a regional or national HII, the components or building blocks that make up the overall information system ought to be defined and an appropriate component architecture specified. This paper discusses current international priorities and trends in developing the HII. It presents technological challenges and alternative approaches towards the creation of an I-EHR, being the aggregation of health data created during all interactions of an individual with the healthcare system. It also presents results from an ongoing Research and Development (R&amp;D) effort towards the implementation of the HII in HYGEIAnet, the regional health information network of Crete, Greece, using a component-based software engineering approach. Critical design decisions and related trade-offs, involved in the process of component specification and development, are also discussed and the current state of development of an I-EHR service is presented. Finally, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and security issues, which are important for the deployment and use of any I-EHR service, are considered. "

"To study the frequency and specificity of acquired coagulation inhibitors in inflammatory and malignant gastrointestinal diseases. In a 10-year period, 511 patients from the island of Crete in Greece were studied, 302 with ulcerative colitis, 112 with Crohn's disease, 82 with gastrointestinal carcinoma and 15 with gastrointestinal lymphoma. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were measured by routine methods. When prothrombin time and/or activated partial thromboplastin time were found to be prolonged, mixture experiments with 25%, 50% and 75% pooled normal human plasma were performed. If clotting times were inadequately corrected, the presence of an acquired inhibitor against a coagulation factor was suggested. Specific coagulation factor assays were then performed with deficient plasmas. Fifteen patients acquired inhibitors to the following coagulation factors within the 10-year observation period: factor IX (four patients); factor X (three patients); factor XII (three patients); factor VIII (two patients); factor XI (two patients); and factor V (one patient). The activity of the above factors varied from &lt; 1% to 10%. Five patients with ulcerative colitis, six with Crohn's disease, two with gastrointestinal lymphoma and two with gastrointestinal carcinoma developed an inhibitor. Only one patient with factor VIII inhibitor presented with severe bleeding and was treated with recombinant human activated factor VII, while the others had no complications. Remission was obtained in all patients after immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy or tumour resection. An increased incidence of coagulation factor inhibitors was found in patients with gastrointestinal inflammatory and malignant diseases compared to the healthy population. In addition, an increased incidence of these inhibitors was also found in the common population of Crete compared to that found in other areas."

The Cretan experience. 	This study aimed to ascertain the frequency and type of hematological findings in a defined group of patients with inborn errors on Crete. The key role of these hematological findings in the diagnosis of the inborn errors in daily practice was explored. A variety of hematological findings were obtained from 31 of the 132 subjects who had been referred to the University Hospital of Heraklion. A diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) was confirmed in 21 subjects, but in 12 of them the diagnosis was combined with hematological findings. The hematological findings consist of a neglected area in the diagnosis of the IEM, and cooperation of primary care physicians and neurologists could help hematologists in the management of people with unexplained hematological symptoms and signs.
PMID:12501807	Mantzouranis EC	Methods Inf Med. 41(5):370-5	2002	User friendliness aspects of home care telematics. 	Asthma is the most common chronic childhood disease with a high number of admissions and emergency room visits in pediatric hospitals. Treatment of asthmatic patients is best done by asthma specialists and requires the chronic use of prophylactic medications, additional treatment for acute exacerbations and regular check-ups. In Crete, a Greek island, there are many children with asthma who are not receiving care by an asthma specialist. The only specialty clinic for asthmatic children in Crete is in Heraklion, a city in the center of the island. We attempted to use telemedicine in order to reach and follow children with asthma who live in distant areas in Crete. We set up a pilot telemedicine program with 10 asthmatic children already followed at the Specialty Clinic. Using teleconferencing techniques, we were able to obtain the medical history, examine the patients, educate them about the disease and adjust the treatment. The parents of patients accepted the telemedicine service with a percentage of 90% and showed a special interest in this new service. We conclude that telemedicine for asthmatic children performed by their specialist is feasible and accepted by the majority of patients.

"Recent data indicate increasing rates of adult obesity and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Greece. No data, however, are available on prevalence of overweight and obesity in relation to CVD risk factors among young adults in Greece. A total of 989 third-year medical students (527 men, 462 women), aged 22 +/- 2 years, were recruited from the University of Crete during the period 1989-2001. Anthropometric measures and blood chemistries were obtained. The relationships between obesity indices (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC], waist-to-hip ratio [WHpR], waist-to-height ratio [WHtR]) and CVD risk factor variables (blood pressure, glucose, serum lipoproteins) were investigated. Approximately 40% of men and 23% of women had BMI &gt; or = 25.0 kg/m2. Central obesity was found in 33.4% (average percentage corresponding to WC &gt; or = 90 cm, WHpR &gt; or = 0.9 and WHtR &gt; or = 50.0) of male and 21.7% (using WC &gt; or = 80 cm, WHpR &gt; or = 0.8, WHtR &gt; or = 50.0) of female students. Subjects above the obesity indices cut-offs had significantly higher values of CVD risk factor variables. BMI was the strongest predictor of hypertension. WHtR in men and WC in women were the most important indicators of dyslipidaemia. A substantial proportion of Greek medical students were overweight or obese, obesity status being related to the presence of hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Simple anthropometric indices can be used to identify these CVD risk factors. Our results underscore the need to implement health promotion programmes and perform large-scale epidemiological studies within the general Greek young adult population."

There have been recent reports of an increased incidence of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with cholangiocarcinoma, resident on the island of Crete, diagnosed between 1992 and 2000, were studied. Case ascertainment was enhanced by collaboration of the pathology departments and all gastroenterologists of Crete in providing relevant data. A specially designed patient protocol was used. Crude incidence rates are presented. During the 9-year period 7 patients were diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma of the intrahepatic ducts, 17 with Klatskin and 16 patients with extrahepatic ducts carcinoma. A steady incidence increase of cholangiocarcinoma, irrespective of location, was shown. The estimated incidence rate per three-year period progressively increased from 0.998 to 2.329 and 3.327 per 100,000 for the periods 92-94, 95-97 and 98-2000, respectively. Median survival time was 8.5 months. No significant difference was seen between survival according to the location of cholangiocarcinoma. A steady incidence increase of cholangiocarcinoma cases in Crete during the time-period 1992-2000 was shown.

The aim of this pilot study was to provide children with cancer hospitalized at the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, with an educational program based on the SIOP guidelines. This would help them to follow the school program during the days of absence due to treatment. The realization of the initial idea generated difficulties that had to be overcome to achieve the goals and caused several changes in the program. Children refused to attend a regular class in the appropriately designed playroom of the Department but were very keen on room-to-room teaching that was adjusted to their needs and wills. This method of teaching was very well accepted by the children. A workup was done with parents and health professionals to convince them of the necessity of such a program and persuade them to participate in the procedure by encouraging children to attend it. Several steps have been taken and others have been planned for the teachers to receive education concerning the special needs of these children after dismissal from the hospital as well as that of their siblings to help in the reentry procedure. An adjustment to the personal needs of the hospitalized children with cancer, especially in areas where the psychosocial resources are minor, has proved very helpful and effective for the reentry of these children to regular school and social life. 
PMID:12555902	Malaby TM	Cult Med Psychiatry. 26(3):283-312	2002	Odds and ends: risk, mortality, and the politics of contingency. 	"Medical anthropology's cogent rethinking of conventional biomedical categories has largely overlooked the core problems of one key concept of both biomedical and social scientific analysis: risk. In particular, the use of the term in medical anthropology (and the social sciences more generally) frequently rests on two assumptions: (1) that contingency necessarily constitutes a threat to individual experience or social order; and (2) that a risk management paradigm that relies on a model of statistical probability is the ontologically preeminent way of engaging chance. Other approaches which do not take risk as the starting point for understanding contingency also have problems; they too assume that contingency is necessarily cause for crisis. These problematic root assumptions lead social analysts to miss how individual actors and local communities variously engage, rather than minimize, contingency. I suggest a new approach that instead aims to treat contingency as normatively neutral and as arising in four domains of experience. Conventional approaches also miss how attempts to account for unexpected events themselves involve struggles between competing paradigms (or tropes) of chance. This contest over accountability I call here the politics of contingency, and I seek thereby to signal the need to renovate our language of uncertainty in order to address its political dimensions. I trace the literature to identify some sources of these terminological problems, and through an examination of the life and death of a close contact in Chania, Crete, I explore his own approach to chance and the different, competing interpretations of his death. I thereby demonstrate the importance of revamping the conventional approach to understanding the contingent nature of human life."

PMID:12647093	Dimitrakopoulos AP, Bemmerzouk AM	Int J Biometeorol. 47(2):73-9	2003	Predicting live herbaceous moisture content from a seasonal drought index. 	In order to provide a relatively simple means of predicting live herbaceous plant moisture content from a readily available meteorological index with an accuracy adequate for fire hazard assessment, the moisture content fluctuations of certain species were correlated with the values of a seasonal drought index based on soil moisture deficiency. The simple linear regression models provided the best fit of the relationship between plant moisture content and the Keetch-Byram drought index (KBDI) values. KBDI predicted with accuracy, for two growing seasons, the moisture content of three annual herbaceous plants ( Piptatherum miliaceum, Parietaria diffusa, Avena sterillis) with shallow rooting systems, typical of the understory vegetation of Pinus brutia forests in the Mediterranean region of Crete, Greece. The greatest aberrations between measured and predicted values of plant moisture content were observed early (May) and late (September) in the growing season, when plant phenology (flushing and withering stages respectively) appears to become the dominant factor in determining plant moisture content regardless of the soil moisture conditions. The KBDI was poorly correlated with the live-needle moisture content of deeply rooted P. brutia trees and modestly with the soil water content of the upper layers. This indicates that the index adequately reflects the moisture condition of the surface soil layers but not the water content deeper in the soil.

"The commonest species of red, brown, and green macroalgae were sampled from a range of biotopes in the Aegean Sea during 1998 for their 137Cs content. Significant differences in 137Cs concentrations were found among different species growing under similar environmental conditions, suggesting that uptake does not follow physical levels but is influenced by allometric parameters and physiological mechanisms. 137Cs content in collected seaweeds were in the descending order: Ulva lactuca&gt;Enteromorpha linza&gt;Gracilaria verrucosa&gt;Ceramium rubrum&gt;Cystoseira barbata. A comparison of the stations studied indicated that the degree of accumulation is also dependent on the geomorphology of the specific area. The west side of Thermaikos Gulf, where the rivers Axios, Aliakmon, and Pinios flow, was highly contaminated as was the Strymonicos Gulf where the river Strymon flows. High cesium concentrations were also observed in algae from Lemnos Island near the mouth of the Dardanelles Channel, most likely due to the horizontal circulation of water masses from the Marmaras Sea to the Aegean Sea resulting in the discharge of 137Cs during the purification process in the Black Sea through the Dardanelles Straits. It is concluded that the general dispersion of 137Cs results from the water circulation regime within the Aegean Sea. Higher levels are present in the northern part of the basin due to current circulation originating from the Black Sea and from outflow of rivers. Levels decrease to the south and east, but increase again to the west of Crete where the Black Sea water mass can be periodically traced."

Is prestorage leucodepletion necessary for leishmaniasis prevention in endemic areas? 	Leishmaniasis is a serious health problem in various endemic areas. There are reports that the parasite can be transmitted via blood transfusions. We studied the clinical utility of flow cytometry for the screening of blood donors in an endemic area in Greece. Samples from 2000 blood donors from the area of Lasithi, Crete, Greece were examined by flow cytometry after labelling with a polyclonal anti-leishmania antibody conjugated with fluorescein-isothiocyanate derived from infected canines in the area. The same blood samples were simultaneously examined for serum anti-leishmania antibodies, May-Grünwald staining of peripheral blood smears and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in buffy coat to the minicircle of kinetoplastic DNA. Direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified area helped discriminate leishmania species. Flow cytometry detected 33 cases with parasites in the peripheral blood leucocytes (1.65%), which were confirmed by PCR. One PCR-positive case was negative by flow cytometry. After prestorage leucodepletion, no sample was positive by PCR. Anti-leishmania antibodies were positive in 304 (15%) cases. Flow cytometry was found to be a sensitive and rapid method of detecting leishmania in peripheral blood samples. Leucodepletion effectively reduces the detection of the parasite, thus minimizing the potential risk of leishmania transmission through blood transfusions in endemic areas.

During a 5-year period (1995-1999) a total of 7090 stool samples obtained from patients with acute diarrhoea, mostly community-acquired, were examined for bacterial pathogens, in the Greek island of Crete. One or more enteric pathogens were isolated from 987 patients (14%). Salmonella enterica were the most commonly isolated bacteria (6%), followed by Campylobacter spp. (4.2%), and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (1.8%). Yersinia enterocolitica (0.6%), Shigella spp. (0.3%), and Aeromonas hydrophila (0.04%), were less frequently isolated. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 65 out of 451 diarrhoeal specimens examined (14.4%). Toxin B was detected in all cases. No verotoxigenic E. coli strains were identified. Resistance to ampicillin was observed in 31.5% of the Salmonella, 58.3% of the Shigella and 31.5% of the EPEC isolates. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed in 4.4% of the Salmonella, 30.5% of the Shigella, and 18.5% of the EPEC isolates. High percentages of resistance to quinolones (44.5% to norfloxacin, and 40.5% to ciprofloxacin), were found among Campylobacter isolates, while resistance to erythromycin was observed in 14.9% of them. With the present study we continue the surveillance of bacterial pathogens associated with diarrhoeal disease on the island of Crete.

A full-term male infant presented with clinical and biochemical findings consistent with the diagnosis of congenital rickets: weak muscle tone, craniotabes, episodes of tremor, hypocalcaemia, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, secondary hyperparathyroidism, decreased 25-hydroxyvitamin D and normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D serum levels. The mother's history and biochemical findings suggested nutritional vitamin D deficiency. Treatment with calcium and vitamin D resulted in the disappearance of clinical findings of rickets, normalization of the baby's biochemical profile and normal growth. It is surprising that this case occurred in an affluent setting, in the Mediterranean island of Crete, with an abundance of sunlight throughout the year. We report this case in order to emphasize the continuing occurrence of congenital rickets even in populations not considered at risk for hypovitaminosis D. A high index of suspicion is required for prompt diagnosis and treatment, thus preventing complications.

The present study aims at gaining a first insight into Greek consumers' attitudes towards low-fat food products. Although Greece, and in particular Crete, have enjoyed a great popularity in terms of the Mediterranean diet, there has been an almost complete lack of low-fat-related surveys concerning the Greek food consumer. Using this as a research trigger, the current investigation evolves around the conflict between 'sensory appeal' and 'healthiness' of low-fat products, widely described in the international literature. Other crucial factors examined are consumers' awareness, occasional use and conscious purchase of, and willingness to pay for, food products with the 'low-fat' claim. Overall, the study has the objective to segment the Greek market in terms of users' perceptions of light products and to identify a number of well-described clusters with clear-cut socio-demographic and behavioural profile.

Erhard's wall lizard, Podarcis erhardii (Sauria: Lacertidae), is highly diversified in Greece and especially in the southern Aegean region. Out of the 28 recognized subspecies, 27 are found in Greece from the North Sporades island-complex in the North Aegean (grossly south of the 39th parallel) to the island of Crete in the South. The species exhibits great morphological and ecological plasticity and inhabits many different habitats from rocky islets and sandy shores to mountaintops as high as 2000m. By examining intraspecific variability at a segment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b we have found that that extant populations of P. erhardii are paraphyletic. Furthermore, we have found that subspecies previously defined on the basis of morphological characteristics do not correspond to different molecular phylogenetic clades, so that their status should be reconsidered. The DNA based biogeographical and phylogenetic history of Podarcis in Southern Greece is congruent with available paleogeographic data of the region, which supports the view that DNA sequences may be a useful tool for the study of palaeogeography.
PMID:12817639	Lerario VL, Giandomenico S, Lopez L, Cardellicchio N	Ann Chim. 93(4):397-406	2003	Sources and distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediments from the Mar Piccolo of Taranto, Ionian Sea, southern Italy. 	The concentrations of 17 parent PAHs, with molecular weight from 128 to 278 Daltons, were determined in surface sediments from the Mar Piccolo of Taranto. The analytical results were compared with the published results for other coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea. The analyses were performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Total PAH content in sediments ranged from 380 to 12750 ng g(-1) dry weight. The levels of the PAHs was higher than the one reported for sediments of the Adriatic Sea and Cretan Sea and of the same order of magnitude of the one known for coastal areas of the western and the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The PAHs distribution showed similar patterns in all sediments analyzed, with compounds with three or more rings. These patterns of distribution and the ratios among low molecular weight PAHs/high molecular weight PAHs, phenanthrene/anthracene and fluoranthene/pyrene indicated that pyrogenic inputs are the main source of these compounds in the Mar Piccolo basin. Based on the comparison of both the individual and the total PAH concentrations with proposed sediment quality guidelines, the acute biological effects on the marine organisms should be negligible.

"To study the epidemiological patterns of childhood-onset type I diabetes in Crete, Greece. The incidence (new cases per 100,000 per year) from 1990 to 2001 was determined in the population of Crete &lt; or = 14 y of age. A total of 89 cases was ascertained. The standardized annual incidence rate was 6.1 per 100,000 population [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 4.9-7.5]. Incidence rates were higher in children 10-14 y of age, boys and residents of urban areas (6.8, 6.7 and 6.6 per 100,000, respectively). Incidence rates were higher [relative risk (RR) 1.46, 95% CI 0.956-2.24] during the 6 y period 1996-2001 (7.2, 95% CI 5.4-9.4) than during the 6 y period 1990-1995 (4.9, 95% CI 3.4-6.9). This increase was more prominent in residents of urban areas and 10-14-y-old children. Although an increase was noted during the period 1990-2001, the childhood type I diabetes incidence rates in Crete remain among the lowest both in Europe and in the Mediterranean islands."

Residues of fenthion and dimethoate pesticides were determined in organic and conventional olive oils by liquid-liquid and solid-phase extractions with subsequent gas chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis. The olive oil samples were collected from Crete during 1997-99. The average concentrations of fenthion in conventional olive oils were 0.1222, 0.145 and 0.1702 mg x kg(-1), and for dimethoate were 0.0226, 0.0264 and 0.0271 mg x kg(-1) for 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The average concentrations of fenthion in organic olive oils were 0.0215, 0.0099 and 0.0035 mg x kg(-1) for 1997, 1998 and 1999, while for dimethoate they were 0.0098, 0.0038 and 0.0010 mg x kg(-1), respectively. All the olive oils contained residue levels lower than the maximum residue levels according to the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius. The organic olive oil contained significantly lower concentrations of the two pesticides. The levels of fenthion and dimethoate in organic olive oils exhibited a decreasing trend following the implementation of the new cultivation method. We propose procedures that should be established in the organic cultivation in order to maximize its effectiveness.

About 5-25% of 16 000 athletes involved in preparation for the Athens 2004 Olympics may encounter respiratory allergy (asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis) triggered by exposure to aeroallergens (pollen and fungi spores). Provide information about circulating aeroallergens in three Olympic cities and ensure safety for the allergic athletes who will visit Greece from January to September 2004. Aeroallergens were recorded using a Burkard volumetric trap. The most frequently implicated pollen (cypress, hazel, wall pellitory, plane, olive, grasses, goosefoot and mugwort) and fungi spores (Alternaria spp., Cladosporium spp.) are presented. These data derive from a 15-year database created by the Pulmonary Department, Thessaloniki, a 2-year database (University of Heraklion-Crete) and a 6-year database by the Pediatric Department, Athens. The above data and the current aeroallergen counts will be continuously announced by the mass media and Internet during the Athens 2004 Olympics. Are expressed as: (A) Presentation (Graphs, Tables) of the fluctuation of mean daily values of pollen grains or fungi spores/m3. (B) Presentation (Tables) of the start, peak and end time of aeroallergen circulation. Peak pollen concentrations were observed between March and May (athletes preparation time). During the 2004 Olympics (August-September) relatively high concentrations of goosefoot, mugwort, Alternaria and Cladosporium will be observed. Aeroallergens circulate in Athens 10-15 days earlier than in Thessaloniki and 10 days later than in Heraklion. The data presented in the study are expected to help allergic Olympic athletes achieve peak performance under prophylactic measures.

"To compare the effect of mechanical and alcohol-assisted excision on the histological ultrastructure of epithelial disks from human corneas. Vardinoyiannion Eye Institute of Crete, University of Crete, Medical School, Crete, Greece. Ten eyes of 10 patients were deepithelialized by 1 of 2 two techniques. In 6 eyes, a customized instrument was used to mechanically separate the epithelial layer. In 4 eyes, the epithelial disks were obtained using the conventional laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK) technique; that is, with alcohol concentrations of 15% and 20%. All specimens were assessed by light and electron microscopy, and the histological findings of the 2 methods were compared. Transmission electron microscopy showed that when the epithelial disks were excised by mechanical separation, the lamina densa and lamina lucida were preserved and the hemidesmosomes had normal morphology along almost the entire length of the basement membrane. The basal epithelial cells of the separated epithelial disks showed minimal trauma and edema. Specimens obtained using 15% and 20% alcohol concentrations showed formation of cytoplasmic fragments of the basal epithelial cells, enlargement of the intercellular spaces, and extensive discontinuities in the basement membrane, which was excised at the level of the lamina lucida. Mechanical separation did not affect the normal cell morphology of the excised epithelial disks. Transmission electron microscopy of the specimens proved the manual technique is less invasive to epithelial integrity than LASEK using either alcohol concentration."

The Mediterranean diet is the lucky definition given by Ancel Keys of the food habits of some populations in the Mediterranean area. Dietary styles of this region may widely vary between coasts and inland. The total fat content of diets may vary from less than 30% in the traditional diet of Southern Italy to about 40% in the island of Crete. Carbohydrate and fibre rich foods also vary in terms of energy content, type and amount of sugars. Also protein-rich foods have large variations being mostly of vegetable origin rather than animal. Finally the original description of this diet also brings to mind the extensive physical activity, mainly related to work and outdoor leisure activities that prevailed in these populations until the sixties. Changes toward transition diet, the meaning of functional food and life style changes in the area at present are also discussed.

A mathematical model is proposed to simulate brackish karstic springs. Rainfall data constitutes model input information while output information is the discharge and the chloride concentration of the water versus time. The model was constructed by considering the mass and mechanical energy balance on the hydrodynamic analog, which includes three reservoirs outflowing in a tube that lies adjacent to the spring. Two reservoirs emulate the karstic system, and the third one emulates the sea. The discharge of the spring is given by the sum of the discharge of the reservoirs, and the chloride concentration by the solution of the mixing problem between the fresh and the salty water, which exists in the tube leading to the spring. The model is applied to the spring of Almiros at Heraklion, Crete, Greece. The agreement between model values and field measurements is very good for depletion periods and satisfactory for recharge periods.

Genetic relationships among 125 Spanish melon ( Cucumis melo L.) accessions from a Spanish germplasm collection were assessed using a standard molecular-marker array consisting of 34 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers bands (19 primers) and 72 reference accessions drawn from previous studies. The reference accession array consisted of a broad range [Japanese (19) Crete (17), African (15), and USA and Europe (US/EU, 21)] of horticultural groupings (Group Cantalupensis, Group Conomon, Group Inodorus, Group Flexuosus, and Group Chito), and of melon market classes (e.g., Charentais, U.S. Western and European Shipper types, Ogen, and Galia, Honeydew, and Casaba). Spanish melon accessions (largely Casaba, Group Inodorus) were genetically distinct from the reference accessions and other Group Inodorus melons of different origins. Most African accessions showed common genetic affinities, and grouped with the Group Chito and the Group Conomon accessions examined. Those accession groupings were distinct from all other accessions belonging to Group Cantalupensis, Flexuosus, and Inodorus accessions originating from Crete, Japan, Europe, and the U.S. Genetic diversity was highest in accessions of African origin and lowest in accessions of Spanish origin. Additional RAPD markers (49 primers, 141 bands) and 22 selected agronomic traits (quantitative and qualitative) were then used to assess the genetic diversity among Spanish accessions. While cluster analysis using fruit characteristics grouped accessions into cultivars, RAPD-based genetic-distance estimate did not provide consistent accession groupings either by cultivar or geographic origin. While the highest level of polymorphism was detected among melons originating from the central region of Spain, and in the Rochet cultivar, accessions from the Andalucía region and Green cultivars were comparatively less diverse. These results indicate that the Spanish melon accessions could be used to broaden the genetic base of local and foreign Casaba germplasm, to enhance the genetic diversity of U.S and European commercial melon germplasm, and to delineate collection strategies for acquisition of additional Spanish landraces.

"The lack of data regarding health habits of medical students in Greece prompted a cross-sectional study to assess tobacco use, alcohol consumption and serum lipoprotein levels among students in the University of Crete School of Medicine. A self-administered questionnaire on smoking and alcohol consumption was distributed to third-year medical students for twelve consecutive years (1989-2000). A total of 849 students (462 males, 387 females) participated in the survey. Biochemical measurements were taken and multi-variant analysis of the data was performed. The prevalence of smoking among males and females was 33.2% (N = 150) and 28.4% (N = 108), respectively (mean cigarette consumption 13/day). As many as 349 males (77.2%) and 220 females (58.0%) reported consuming alcohol on a regular basis. The prevalence of low HDL-cholesterol (&lt; 0.9 mmol/l) was 14.5% in males and 5.1% in females, and of high LDL-cholesterol levels (&gt; 4.1 mmol/l) in 11.1% of male and 5.5% of female participants. Smoking was related to higher triglyceride (p = 0.032), and lower HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.037) serum levels. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and the TC/HDL-cholesterol ratio were strongly related with the level of smoking (p = 0.006, p = 0.008, and p = 0.006 respectively). The results document a high prevalence of smoking among physicians-to-be in Greece. Tobacco use was strongly associated with a lipid profile predisposing to increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Health promotion programmes should therefore be instituted not only during the first years of medical studies, but rather at a much earlier stage in life."

Study design and setting Eight rabbits were iontophoresed using gadopentetate dimeglumine solution 469 mg/mL. Then, all rabbits underwent magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of gadopentetate dimeglumine in the middle and inner ear structures. The study was conducted in the tertiary referral center the University Hospital of Crete. The high signal intensity of the gadopentetate dimeglumine solution was demonstrated within the middle ear cavity and inner ear structures of all iontophoresed ears and in none of the noniontophoresed ones. Transtympanic iontophoresis could be an effective method for the passage of pharmaceutical agents into the middle and inner ear for the treatment of middle and inner ear diseases.

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of commercially available drugs in order to design control strategies against wohlfahrtiosis. The test substances were cypermethrin and doramectin sc. The test animals were randomly divided between three groups (30 in each): one treated with cypermethrin pour-on, one treated with doramectin and one untreated controls. The trial lasted 45 days and the animals were inspected daily for natural infestations by W. magnifica. The first infestations were recorded on the 5th, 13th and the 23rd day in the control, cypermethrin and doramectin groups, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the survival curves for doramectin and the control group up to day 40, but not at the end of the study.

As Greece moves during the last two decades toward a national health care system, which gives emphasis to the development of a primary care system, many worry how to ensure that the quality of care is assessed. This is more apparent in the rural populations, in which health care is served to a large extent by physicians without formal training in general practice. This article explores the level of knowledge of primary care physicians in relation to Alzheimer's disease in geographically defined areas of Crete, Greece, in comparison with that of general practitioners in Ostergötland, Sweden, and in Iceland. It emphasizes the need for better education and training for primary care physicians in Crete in both the early diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease.

"The objective of this study was to determine nutrient intake and food consumption patterns among medical students at the University of Crete, Greece. As part of the Clinical Nutrition course from 1989 to 2001, a total of 951 third-year medical students (500 male, 451 female) aged 22+/-2 years underwent dietary interview, during which individual 24-h dietary recalls were taken. The students also completed a questionnaire on smoking habits, and anthropometric measurements were performed. The Mann-Whitney test was applied to assess differences in nutrient and food group intake between lower and higher fat eaters. Analysis of covariance was used to study relationships between nutrient intakes and tobacco use, adjusting for gender, age, and body mass index. The mean daily energy intake was 2493 kcal (10437 kJ) for males and 1675 kcal (7012 kJ) for females. The contribution of total fat to energy intake was 40% in each gender. Lower fat eaters (&lt;/=34.3% of total energy) had higher intakes of fiber (P&lt;0.01), vitamin C (P&lt;0.01) and fruits (P&lt;0.05), and a lower consumption of red meat (P&lt;0.01) than students in the upper fat quartile (&gt;/=46.0% of total energy). Smokers had higher intakes of energy (P&lt;0.05) and saturated fatty acids (P&lt;0.01), and lower intakes of fiber (P&lt;0.001), folate (P&lt;0.05) and vitamin C (P&lt;0.001) than non-smokers/ex-smokers. Our results indicate a need for Greek medical students to improve their dietary and health habits. Dietary assessment could be used to enhance nutrition education in medical schools."

The CORAS risk management process is based on the Australian standard for risk management and aims at improved methodology for precise, unambiguous, and efficient risk assessment of security critical systems. CORAS addresses security critical systems in general, but places particular emphasis on IT security. For CORAS, a system is not just technology, but also the humans interacting with the technology and all relevant aspects of the surrounding organisation and society. The use of graphical models in CORAS furthers communication between the different stakeholders of a risk assessment, and makes it easier for non-technicians to take part. Telemedicine services and electronic applications used in the health sector have a high demand for security. The medical developers, providers and users of such services and systems are important contributors in the risk assessment of these services and systems. CORAS has successfully been used to involve medical professionals in the model-based risk assessment of a telemedicine system called Tele-cardiology in Crete. This paper presents the use of the CORAS framework to assess this telemedicine system giving some conclusions on the experience gained.

"The root galling index and the densities of eggs in roots and juveniles in soil of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica (Treub) Chitwood on tomato, and the effect of these on crop yield were assessed in greenhouse experiments applying various treatments at two different sites in Crete, Greece. Tomato crops were grown for four cycles by rotating nematode-resistant (first and third spring crops) with susceptible (second and fourth autumn crops) cultivars and receiving the following treatments: (a) untreated control; (b) methyl bromide application before the first and third crops; (c) application of the fungus Pochonia chlamydosporia (Goddard) Zare, Gams &amp; Evans before planting the first, third and fourth crops with a supplementary application three weeks after the beginning of the fourth crop; (d) application of oxamyl in both sites and fenamiphos in site 1 only at the second and fourth crops; (e) combination of treatments (c) and (d). The fungus density in soil was monitored three weeks after application and at the end of each crop, when roots were lifted. Pochonia chlamydosporia had a variable establishment and did not control the nematode. Its pathogenicity on eggs was not demonstrated, as in all cases galls were big, with all egg masses inside and protected from infection. The methyl bromide treatment significantly reduced root galling and egg production compared to other treatments in all crop cycles and the yield of the fourth crop was significantly greater. Nematicides reduced nematode densities compared with untreated controls and the fungus treatment, but they were less effective than methyl bromide and resulted in increased yield in one site only."

For the past 20 years, the National Foundation for Agricultural Research in Crete and the School of Agricultural Technology of the Technological and Educational Institute of Crete have been involved in a number of research and development activities, related to the production and evaluation of compost derived from a variety of local solid, mainly agricultural organic wastes. Materials such as olive press cake, olive tree leaves (OTL) and branches, vine branches (VB), pressed grape skins (PGS), pig manure (PM), sewage sludge and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) have been evaluated for their behaviour during composting, their compatibility in mixtures and the quality of the end product. The quality evaluation included both a detailed physiochemical (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), nutrients concentration, heavy metal concentration, etc.) and biological analyses (pathogenic microorganisms). It also included an agronomic evaluation, in which composts were used either as a soil amendment or as a component for substrates in open air or covered (greenhouse) cultivation mainly of local vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.). All materials were composted successfully, especially when mixed. The end products contained large amounts of organic matter, usually combined with an increased EC value. Pressed grape skins should be considered as the ideal raw material, producing a high quality compost, with the lowest EC value (1.57 mS cm(-1)) and the largest organic matter concentration (84.50%), compared to all other materials. When any of the produced compost was used in a ratio of 30% by volume (v/v), it increased plant growth, whereas in larger volumes, it presented phytotoxic behaviour, inhibiting both root and shoot development.
PMID:14753653	Keramitsoglou I, Cartalis C, Kassomenos P	Environ Manage. 32(2):290-8	2003	Decision support system for managing oil spill events. 	The Mediterranean environment is exposed to various hazards, including oil spills, forest fires, and floods, making the development of a decision support system (DSS) for emergency management an objective of utmost importance. The present work presents a complete DSS for managing marine pollution events caused by oil spills. The system provides all the necessary tools for early detection of oil-spills from satellite images, monitoring of their evolution, estimation of the accident consequences and provision of support to responsible Public Authorities during clean-up operations. The heart of the system is an image processing-geographic information system and other assistant individual software tools that perform oil spill evolution simulation and all other necessary numerical calculations as well as cartographic and reporting tasks related to a specific management of the oil spill event. The cartographic information is derived from the extant general maps representing detailed information concerning several regional environmental and land-cover characteristics as well as financial activities of the application area. Early notification of the authorities with up-to-date accurate information on the position and evolution of the oil spill, combined with the detailed coastal maps, is of paramount importance for emergency assessment and effective clean-up operations that would prevent environmental hazard. An application was developed for the Region of Crete, an area particularly vulnerable to oil spills due to its location, ecological characteristics, and local economic activities.

Disagreement exists between different COPD guidelines considering classification of severity of the disease. The aim of our study was to determine whether there is any correlation between severity scales of various COPD guidelines (ATS, BTS, ERS and GOLD) and the frequency of hospitalisations for COPD exacerbation. A cohort of 67 COPD patients (65 male 2 female, 45 ex-smokers, 22 current smokers, aged (69.4 +/- 1.1)) was recruited from those admitted in the pulmonary clinic of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete for an acute exacerbation. Lung function tests and arterial blood gases analyses were performed during stable conditions at a scheduled visit 2 months after discharge. The patients were stratified using the FEV1 percent-predicted measurement of this visit into mild, moderate and severe in accordance to the ATS, BTS, ERS and GOLD scales of severity. The number of hospitalisations for acute exacerbation was recorded for the following 18 months. A total of 165 exacerbations were recorded. The correlation between the severity of COPD and the number of hospitalisations per year was statistically significant using the GOLD classification system of severity (P = 0.02 and r = 0.294). A weak correlation was also found between the number of hospitalisations and the ERS classification system (P = 0.05 and r = 0.24). No statistically significant correlation was found between the number of hospitalisations and the ATS or BTS severity scales. In conclusion the GOLD and ERS classification systems of severity of COPD correlated to exacerbations causing hospitalisation. The same was not true for the ATS and BTS severity scales. Better correlation was achieved with the GOLD scale.

"Aedes (Stegomyia) cretinus is a rarely documented mosquito with a Mediterranean distribution, whereas Aedes (S.) albopictus has spread worldwide in the past two decades because of its anthropogenic associations. A third closely related species, Aedes (S.) flavopictus, is sympatric with A. albopictus in northeast Asia. The three species are characterized by a striking mid-thoracic white stripe and, consequently, field-collected individuals may be difficult to separate by morphology. Sixteen biochemical markers were described for laboratory strains representing the three species; these provided the first biochemical genetic profile for A. cretinus and A. flavopictus. Diagnostic enzymes for identifying each species pair were determined. A biochemical key was provided to distinguish among adults of the three species. Several enzyme loci that were diagnostic for the adult stage proved unreliable for identifying immature stages. Voucher specimens for link-reared series of larva, pupa, adult male, and adult female stages of the A. cretinus Crete strain (n = 88) and the A. albopictus Nepal strain (n = 105) were deposited at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, New Haven, CT."

"The authors studied Parkinson disease (PD) in natives of Crete, a population sharing a common genetic and cultural background. Analysis of data from 247 index PD cases revealed a hereditary component for PD (OR 3.37; p &lt; 0.001 for a first-degree relative of a PD patient). In 12 bilineal families (PD originating from both parental sides) identified, a high proportion (43%) of bilineal members had PD, but only 5.7% of their offspring were affected. These data suggest a recessive or an oligogenic inheritance for PD."

Mitochondrial DNA (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA) sequences were analysed within Tarentola mauritanica and other selected species of Tarentola. Several highly genetically distinct lineages occur in North Africa, revealing phylogroups in southern and central Morocco, northern Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. A single haplotype characterizes populations across Spain, Portugal, Italy, Menorca, Crete, and Tunisia raising the possibility of an anthropogenic introduction followed by rapid population expansion throughout southern Europe. T. mauritanica is paraphyletic with respect to T. angustimentalis, a Canary islands endemic. The high genetic diversity observed across North Africa suggests T. mauritanica may represent a species complex.

As part of the design of an integrated waste management scheme through the use of the PRECEDE/PROCEED model in the area of Crete, data concerning the applicability of composting in various agricultural wastes was considered as necessary. Vegetable residues from tomato, cucumber, eggplant, and pepper crops were collected, shredded and composted either alone or with the use of olive press cake, olive tree leaves, and branches and vine branches as bulking agents. Seven random combinations--mixtures of the above materials were composted using windrows, where additional four similar windrows were made up by approximately 10 m3 of the above mentioned vegetable crop residues. All windrows were turned four times during the eight weeks thermophylic phase, with the help of a mechanical turner. A large number of physiochemical parameters were monitored in the raw materials, at the end of the thermophylic phase and at the end of the maturation phase. The temperature which was monitored daily, recorded the highest values (above 55 degrees C) in the windrows where bulking agents were used. All raw vegetable crop residues and their mixtures presented increased electrical conductivity values (above 5 mS/cm and up to 9.7 mS/cm) resulting to end products with respectively high EC values (above 3 mS/cm and up to 15 mS/cm) probably due to the presence of large amounts of soil, rich in fertilisers, attached to the roots of the plants. There was no detection of any remains of the 13 pesticides for which all 11 composts were tested for. The accuracy of the results was tested through a recovery test of the pesticides in mature compost, resulting to acceptable recovery values.

"The relationships between n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in subcutaneous fat, BMI and overweight status were investigated in eighty-eight children from Crete and Cyprus. Overweight status, BMI and serum lipid levels were similar in children at both locations, but Cretan children had higher levels of total MUFA than Cypriot children (62.2 (sd 2.8) v. 52.2 (sd 2.8) % area, respectively, P&lt;0.001) and consequently Cypriot children had higher levels of total saturated, polyunsaturated, trans, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids. Cypriot children had also higher levels of individual n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, specifically linoleic, alpha-linolenic and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acids. The variance of BMI was better explained (38.2 %) by adipose tissue arachidonic acid content than any other n-3 and n-6 fatty acids. Mean levels of arachidonic acid, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were higher in overweight and obese subjects. All obese subjects fell in the 4th quartile of arachidonic acid levels, whereas 88.9 % of overweight subjects fell in the 3rd and 4th quartile of arachidonic acid. These results indicate positive associations between adipose tissue arachidonic acid and BMI and overweight status. Further research could clarify whether this association is causal."
PMID:15052492	Kok FJ, Kromhout D	Eur J Nutr. 43 Suppl 1:I/2-5	2004	Atherosclerosis--epidemiological studies on the health effects of a Mediterranean diet. 	"Mediterranean diets are characterized by olive oil, as the dominant fat source and a high to moderate consumption of fruit and vegetables, cereal products, fish, legumes, in combination with little meat and wine with meals. The ""reference"" Mediterranean diet seems to differ according to country, but is associated with good health and a long life expectancy. From the Seven Countries Studies, it has been shown that especially the traditional Cretan diet was associated with very low 25-year mortality rates for coronary heart disease, cancer and all-causes. In terms of nutrients and bioactive compounds the ""reference"" Mediterranean diet is low in saturated fat and high in monounsaturated fatty acids, high in antioxidants especially vitamin C and E, and high in fiber and folic acid. Several epidemiological studies have investigated these dietary components either separately or in combination in other than Mediterranean populations. In general, also in other populations beneficial effects on the coronary risk profile have been observed, which gives further support to the positive health effects of the Mediterranean diet. Intervention studies in East Finland and Southern Italy have convincingly shown that the coronary risk profile (lower LDL cholesterol and blood pressure levels) is improved by a Mediterranean diet. Moreover, the Cretan diet was tested in cardiac patients and showed a 70 % lower cardiac and all-causes mortality compared to the control diet. In conclusion, epidemiological studies and intervention trials suggest that the Cretan Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of coronary heart disease."

"To examine pharmaceutical needs, prescribed drugs, knowledge about pharmacotherapy and health behaviours among Social Care indigent elderly patients. There were a total of 551 Social Care indigent patients registers in Chania, Crete, Greece at the time of the study (1995-97), of whom 89 (40 men and 49 women) were elderly patients (&gt; or =65 years old). The control group comprised 171 (81 men and 90 women) Social Security insured elderly patients (&gt; or =65 years old). The socio-demographic profile of the indigent elderly patients reveals an unemployment rate of 99% (versus 5% in the control group, P&lt;0.05) and an illiteracy rate of 38% (versus 5%, P&lt;0.05). The most commonly prescribed defined daily doses (DDD) of medications were cardiovascular drugs (45.0% indigent versus 48.3%) and nervous system drugs (14.4% versus 8.8%). The most frequently prescribed drug, as a percentage of DDD, was nitroglycerin (14.5% versus 26.0%) and the most expensive drug, expressed as a percentage of the total cost of drugs, was omeprazole (6.5% versus 4.6%). The most common disease was hypertension (42.1% versus 23.2%, P&lt;0.05). There were also significant differences between the two groups of patients (P&lt;0.05) in the understanding of drug usage instructions (35.4% versus 68.6%), in asking the pharmacist for advice (44.6% versus 71.5%) and in understanding special diet instructions (18.7% versus 34.7%). Regarding the health behavior patterns, significant differences (P&lt;0.05) were found in the consumption of sausages (38.6% versus 15.6%), salt (29.8% versus 12.0%), more than one glass per day of alcoholic drinks (13.8% versus 4.3%) and in daily smoking cigarettes (48.8% indigent versus 12.8% control). The present study emphasizes the need for more information on drug use and the necessity for a continuing health educational intervention among Social Care indigent elderly patients."

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relation between adipose tissue polyunsaturated fatty acids, an index of long-term or habitual fatty acid dietary intake and depression. The sample consisted of 150 elderly males from the island of Crete. The subjects were survivors of the Greek Seven Countries Study group. The mean age was 84 years. The number of subjects with complete data on all variables studied was 63. Subjects were examined by the Preventive Medicine and Nutrition Clinic of the University of Crete. Depression was assessed through the use of the short form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Depression correlated negatively with adipose tissue alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3). Depressed subjects had significantly reduced (-10.5%) adipose tissue C18:3n-3 levels than non-depressed subjects. The observed negative relation between adipose tissue C18:3n-3 and depression, in the present study, appears to indicate increasing long-term dietary C18:3n-3 intakes with decreasing depression. This agrees with findings of other studies indicating an inverse relation between depression and consumption of fish and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. This is the first literature report of a relation between adipose tissue C18:3n-3 and depression. Furthermore, this is the first report of a relation between adipose PUFA and depression in an elderly sample. Depression has been reported to be associated with elevated cytokines, such as, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, INF-gamma and INF-alpha. Fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids, on the other hand, have been reported to inhibit cytokine production. The observed negative relation between adipose C18:3n-3 and depression, therefore, may stem from the inhibiting effect of C18:3n-3 or its long-chain metabolites on cytokine synthesis.

Regular transfusions and iron chelation therapy have transformed the life expectancy of homozygous beta-thalassaemia patients, so that it can now be considered a chronic condition. A health questionnaire survey of all adults suffering from beta-thalassaemia major receiving treatment on the Island of Crete, Greece was carried out with the aim of ascertaining the factors that are associated with their attitudes and expectations. The responses of 67 of the 72 patients, aged 18-45 years, were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to extract three component indicators (Adaptability, Optimism and Pessimism Indicators), which reflected their attitudes towards life and two component indicators (Healing and Therapy Indicators) that reflected their expectations from life. These were then tested against the respondents' socio-demographic characteristics, their health status and satisfaction with the services. It was found that the Optimism Indicator was associated with a positive comparative assessment of health status, while the Adaptability Indicator was associated with a positive subjective assessment of health status. The Adaptability Indicator was also higher in those satisfied with the services but it was lower in the best-educated group. The pessimism indicator was associated with a negative comparative assessment of health status and with the lowest level education. The expectation indicators showed an interaction with gender and other parameters such as admission to hospital. The relationship between the attitudes and the expectations of patients suffering from a chronically disability condition and specific experiences during their treatment regimens raises several issues related to the need for better health education and psychological support of the group of patients, as well as issues related to the communication skills of the staff caring for them.

This study estimated the clinical effectiveness of five different antibiotic regimens (doxycycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline plus chloramphenicol, and doxycycline plus ciprofloxacin) administered for infection with Rickettsia typhi in terms of the duration of the fever. Eighty-seven patients with endemic typhus were hospitalized between 1993 and 1998 at the General Hospital of Chania in Chania, Crete, Greece. The mean time to defervescence was 2.9 days for doxycycline, 4.0 days for chloramphenicol, and 4.2 days for ciprofloxacin. In patients receiving combinations of doxycycline plus chloramphenicol and doxycycline plus ciprofloxacin, fever subsided in 3.4 and 4.0 days, respectively. The outcome was favorable in all patients, and no deaths or relapses were observed within two months.
PMID:15167223	Simopoulos AP	Eur J Cancer Prev. 13(3):219-30	2004	The traditional diet of Greece and cancer. 	"The term 'Mediterranean diet', implying that all Mediterranean people have the same diet, is a misnomer. The countries around the Mediterranean basin have different diets, religions and cultures. Their diets differ in the amount of total fat, olive oil, type of meat, wine, milk, cheese, fruits and vegetables; and the rates of coronary heart disease and cancer, with the lower death rates and longer life expectancy occurring in Greece. The diet of Crete represents the traditional diet of Greece prior to 1960. Analyses of the dietary pattern of the diet of Crete shows a number of protective substances, such as selenium, glutathione, a balanced ratio of n-6/n-3 essential fatty acids (EFA), high amounts of fibre, antioxidants (especially resveratrol from wine and polyphenols from olive oil), vitamins E and C, some of which have been shown to be associated with lower risk of cancer, including cancer of the breast. Epidemiological studies and animal experiments indicate that n-3 fatty acids exert protective effects against some common cancers, especially cancers of the breast, colon and prostate. Many mechanisms are involved, including suppression of neoplastic transformation, cell growth inhibition, and enhanced apoptosis and anti-angiogenicity, through the inhibition of eicosanoid production from n-6 fatty acids; and suppression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-6 gene expression by n-3 fatty acids. Recent intervention studies in breast cancer patients indicate that n-3 fatty acids, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in particular, increase the response to chemopreventive agents. In patients with colorectal cancer, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA decrease cell proliferation, and modulate favourably the balance between colonic cell proliferation and apoptosis. These findings should serve as a strong incentive for the initiation of intervention trials that will test the effect of specific dietary patterns in the prevention and management of patients with cancer."

"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of implantation of a new posterior chamber phakic refractive lens (PRL, Ciba Vision Surgical) in highly myopic eyes. Department of Ophthalmology, Medical School, University of Crete, Vardinoyannion Eye Institute of Crete, Crete, Greece. Thirty-four myopic eyes of 19 patients were treated for high myopia with implantation of a silicone PRL in the posterior chamber. Mean patient age was 29.0 years +/- 7.9 (SD) (range 18 to 44 years). Manifest refraction in spherical equivalent (MR), uncorrected (UCVA) and best corrected (BCVA) visual acuity (decimal scale), intraocular pressure, higher-order aberrations (root-mean-square [RMS] wavefront error measured with a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor WASCA analyzer [Carl Zeiss, Meditec]), possible complications, and subjective symptoms were evaluated. Phakic refractive lenses were successfully implanted in all eyes. Mean follow-up was 17.17 +/- 3.76 months (range 12 to 24 months). There was a statistically significant reduction in the MR (from -14.70 D +/- 2.65 D [range -20.75 D to -10.50 D] to -0.61 D +/- 0.89 D [range -2.25 D to 1.00 D]) (P&lt;.001). Twenty-seven (79%) and 15 eyes (44%) were within +/-1.00 D and +/-0.50 D of target refraction, respectively. Mean UCVA significantly improved (from counting fingers to 0.62 +/- 0.28 (range 0.08 to 1.20) (P&lt;.001). Mean BCVA also improved from 0.70 +/- 0.24 (range 0.10 to 1.00) to 0.85 +/- 0.24 (range 0.10 to 1.20) (P&lt;0.001). Overall, there was a mean increase in BCVA of 1.5 +/- 1.5 lines (range loss of 2 lines to gain of 5 lines). There was no statistically significant difference in higher-order aberrations after PRL implantation (pre-PRL RMS: 0.18 microm +/- 0.08 microm [range 0.09 microm to 0.38 microm]; post-PRL RMS: 0.21 microm +/- 0.08 microm; [range 0.05 microm to 0.38 microm]) (P =.12). The PRL showed encouraging results in treating high myopia. Additional patients and longer follow-up period are needed to detect the long-term efficacy and safety of this refractive lens."

Homocysteine (Hcy) is recognised as a risk factor for IHD. Serum Hcy is negatively correlated with serum folate levels, the main sources of which are fruits, vegetables and legumes. The present case-control study was designed to examine the relationship between serum Hcy levels and IHD and to assess the role of dietary factors in the southern Mediterranean population of Crete, Greece. Serum Hcy, folate, vitamin B12, creatinine and glucose levels and a full lipid profile were measured in 152 patients with established IHD, median age 64 (range 33-77) years, and 152 healthy control subjects, age- and sex-matched. Dietary data were assessed using a 3 d food intake record. Compared with controls, patients with IHD had significantly higher daily intakes of vitamin B12 and MUFA and significantly lower intakes of carbohydrate, fibre, folate, cholesterol, n-3 fatty acids and total trans unsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, patients had significantly higher serum Hcy, vitamin B12 and creatinine levels, but significantly lower folate. Serum folate concentrations in both groups had a significant positive correlation with dietary fibre consumption and a significant inverse correlation with vitamin B12 intake. IHD patients should be encouraged to increase their daily dietary intake of fibre, folate and n-3 fatty acids, which are significant components of the traditional Cretan Mediterranean diet. Where dietary folate intake is inadequate, folate supplements are recommended to reduce elevated Hcy levels.

Points of comparison were formed during the patient's consultations and clinical investigations. Although the level of knowledge and GP's competence in Crete and New South Wales appear to be similar and there is an impression that the patient satisfaction in Greece is comparable to that in Australia, a striking feature in Greek primary care is the communication between practitioner and patient, as well as the poor level of note keeping. In contrast, Primary Care in Greece seems to be far more involved in research. To attain a higher quality in primary care, leading to a better outcome for the people of Greece, the primary care physicians need more effective vocational training and the appropriate support from health authorities.

There is evidence that the prevalence and morbidity of childhood asthma are increasing in many countries despite improvement of therapeutic regimens. We aimed to study possible changes in childhood asthma morbidity in Crete, Greece, by evaluating hospital admissions and emergency room visits for childhood asthma before and after 1-year regular follow-up at a special pediatric pulmonary out-patient clinic. We followed-up 118 asthmatic children, aged 1-14 years, at a special pediatric pulmonary outpatient clinic. We evaluated the total number of hospital admissions due to asthma as well as asthma exacerbations during the 12 months before and 12 months after the regular follow-up care at the special pediatric pulmonary outpatient clinic. The total annual number of hospital admissions of the 118 children before and after the regular follow-up was 122 and 19, respectively (reduction of 84%). Similarly, the total number of asthma exacerbations was 771 before and 230 after the 1-year follow-up (reduction of 71%). These findings show that regular follow-up care of asthmatic children at a specialized pediatric pulmonary outpatient clinic considerably reduces the morbidity of childhood asthma, thus reducing hospital costs for asthma and improving the quality of life for asthmatic children and their families.

"The longevity and excellent health status of the population of Crete has been attributed to its lifestyle and dietary habits. The impact of Greek Orthodox Christian Church fasting on these dietary habits has never been studied. One hundred and twenty Greek Orthodox Christians living in Crete participated in a 1-year prospective study. One half of the subjects, who fasted regularly (fasters), and sixty non-faster controls were followed longitudinally for the three main fasting periods over 1 year; Christmas (40 d), Lent (48 d) and the Assumption (15 d). Pre- and end-holy days measurements were performed in each fasting period including: 24 h dietary recall, blood collection and anthropometric measurements. Based on the 24 h recall, fasters as compared with controls had lower intakes of end-holy days dietary cholesterol, total fat, saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids and protein (P &lt; 0.001). Fasters presented a decrease of 753 kJ (180 kcal) in end-holy days energy intake (P &lt; 0.05) compared with an increase of 573 kJ (137 kcal) in the controls (P &lt; 0.05). Fasters had a decrease in end-holy days Ca intake (P &lt; 0.001) and an increase in end-holy days total dietary fibre (P &lt; 0.001) and folate (P &lt; 0.05), attributed to their higher consumption of fruit and vegetables in end-holy periods (P &lt; 0.001). There were no differences for other vitamins or minerals between pre- and end-holy periods in both groups except for vitamin B2. The Orthodox Christian dietary regulations are an important component of the Mediterranean diet of Crete characterised by low levels of dietary saturated fatty acids, high levels of fibre and folate, and a high consumption of fruit, vegetables and legumes."

Laboratory examination of hair from drug users has been employed for the last 5 years in Crete, in addition to the psychiatric or other forensic clinical examinations necessary for the confirmation of a person's use of drugs. The present study reports results of total and sectional head, axillary and pubic hair analysis of imprisoned abusers under interrogation and awaiting presentation at the Crime Court. Morphine levels in total head hair samples 1, 2 and 4 months after preliminary imprisonment ranged from 1.2 to 38.2, 0.5 to 22.5 and 0.1 to 4.9 ng/mg of hair respectively, while the maximum morphine levels amongst all studied groups of those arrested were found in the sections of axillary and pubic hair. Notably high morphine levels in head, axillary and pubic hair sections (13.7, 8.4 and 18.1) ng/mg respectively) were measured, even in abusers who had been imprisoned between 2 and 4 months. Hair tests may considerably assist to evaluate the systematic present and past abuse of heroin and other drugs. Consequently, it may be used as valuable expertise evidence during questioning and in court.

The practice of forensic medicine in Greece is similar to that in other European countries. That is Greece follows the continental model of sudden death investigations, whose norms govern the exercise of forensic medicine through Greek criminal procedure law. In Greece, a university and Government system of forensic medicine exist and occasionally work side-by-side. University departments are strategically placed in all districts of the country. State forensic medicine services are located in Athens, Piraeus and Crete and function in parallel with the local University departments of forensic medicine. Forensic examinations on the living are also exclusively performed by the University and State Legal Medicine services. The cases are simply divided according to the countries of these areas. A recent regulation by the Supreme Court eliminated the overlapping of jurisdictions emphasizing the role of the University departments, and finally establishing a new University-oriented medico-legal system throughout Greece.

Synchrotron radiation extended X-ray absorption fine structure (SR EXAFS) was employed to study the transformation of coordination environment and the redox speciation of arsenic in a newly discovered arsenic hyperaccumulator, Cretan brake (Pteris cretica L. var nervosa Thunb). It showed that the arsenic in the plant mainly coordinated with oxygen, except that some arsenic coordinated with S as As-GSH in root. The complexation of arsenic with GSH might not be the predominant detoxification mechanism in Cretan brake. Although some arsenic in root presented as As(V) in Na2HAsO4 treatments, most of arsenic in plant presented as As(III)-O in both treatments, indicating that As(V) tended to be reduced to As(III) after it was taken up into the root, and arsenic was kept as As(III) when it was transported to the above-ground tissues. The reduction of As(V) primarily proceeded in the root.

"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relation between adipose tissue polyunsaturated fatty acids, an index of long-term or habitual fatty acid dietary intake and depression. The sample consisted of 90 adolescents from the island of Crete. There were 54 girls and 36 boys, aged 13-18. The mean age was 15.2 years. Subjects were examined by the Preventive Medicine and Nutrition Clinic of the University of Crete. Depression was assessed through the use of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Unlike other studies, there were no significant relations between adipose tissue n-3 or n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and depression. BDI correlated positively with adipose tissue C20:3n-6/C18:3n-6 ratio, while CES-D correlated positively with adipose tissue (C20:3n-6+C22:5n-3)/(C18:3n-6+C20:5n-3) ratio. Depressed subjects (BDI&gt;16, CES-D&gt;16) had significantly elevated adipose tissue C20:3n-6/C18:3n-6 and (C20:3n-6+C22:5n-3)/(C18:3n-6+C20:5n-3) ratios, than non-depressed subjects. The observed positive relation between depression and the particular fatty acid ratios, in the present study, appears to indicate increasing activity of elongases, the enzymes responsible for elongating polyunsaturated fatty acids into their longer-chain derivatives, with increasing depression. This is the first literature report of a possible relation between elongases and depression. The observed relation may stem from a possible over-expression of the HELO1 (ELOVL5) gene, the gene encoding a protein responsible for elongating long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, in the adipose tissue of depressed adolescents."

"The aim of the present study was to examine secular trends in major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, that is, obesity and dyslipidaemia, among Cretan children during 1982-2002. Epidemiological survey. A total of 528 boys in 1982 and 620 boys in 2002, aged 12.1+/-0.1 y, were randomly selected from urban and rural regions throughout the county of Iraklio, Crete, Greece. Care was taken so that all procedures in 2002 closely matched those in 1982. Mean height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 1.1, 9.6, and 8.4% higher, respectively, in 2002 vs 1982 (P&lt;0.001). The prevalence of overweight and obesity has risen by 63 and 202%, respectively (P&lt;0.001). Contemporary children were found to have 3.6% higher total cholesterol (TC), 24.9% lower high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), 25.3% higher low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), 19.4% higher triacylglycerol, 36.6% higher TC/HDL-C ratio, and 60.3% higher LDL-C/HDL-C ratio compared with their peers in 1982 (P&lt;0.003). These differences persisted even when adjusting for BMI (P&lt;0.02). The proportion of children having abnormal lipid values was much greater nowadays than in the 1980s, yielding odds ratios of 1.4-8.8 (P&lt;0.005). Results are indicative of a largely deteriorated CVD risk profile in Cretan children since 1982, and predict an unfavourable CVD morbidity and mortality for this population in the foreseeable future."

During the past few decades there has been a gradual abandoning of the traditional Mediterranean diet by the population of Crete and especially among the younger generations. Since this is related to the rapidly increasing morbidity and mortality rates from chronic diseases, the need for educating young people on the principles of good nutrition becomes increasingly important. It is also acknowledged that the epidemiological field needs to focus on studying the implementation process, since this will allow for a deeper understanding of the outcomes. The aims of the present study were to explore the process of implementing an innovation in Cretan primary schools and to identify best teaching practices and principles. In three state primary schools on the island of Crete, 107 children took part in a 30-h nutrition and media education programme. Classroom observations were used to define attitudes towards the programme and teaching methods. Besides baseline and post evaluation, the pupils were also interviewed about 11 months after the end of the programme. During observation of the teaching process, emerging issues were the teacher's motivation and interest in the course, his/her preparation before each class, teaching ability and communication skills, the respect and discipline he/she kept and the innovative teaching methods used. In some cases researcher intervention in the classroom could not be avoided. Overall, individual teacher willingness and teaching skills were mainly responsible for the quality of teaching, the variety of educational methods used in classrooms and pupils' interest in the course. Changes in pupils' knowledge and recall of the course were related to teacher enthusiasm but also to researcher intervention. Exploring the teaching and learning process allowed a deeper understanding of the data. It is concluded that attempts to introduce the principles of a Mediterranean diet to children through nutrition education require innovative, enthusiastic and highly motivated teachers.

To implement quality improvement programs and assess the clinical effectiveness within the primary care setting. The introduction of clinical governance teams, the establishment of a patient-based record system, and the dissemination of practice guidelines were included among the efforts made to improve the quality of care. The clinical effectiveness was measured using EUROPEP (European Task Force on Patient Evaluations of General Practice tool) for evaluating patient's opinion and contracts between health authorities and primary care physicians and nurses. Clinical governance teams of 5-6 practitioners were formed in all health centers. Health cards were created for 6,150 individuals, and a high satisfaction rate with the interest in the patient's personal situation (97.6% of participants assessed it as excellent), physical examination (97.6%), and giving information about symptoms and illness (97.6%) was recorded on the EUROPEP sample. Lack of infrastructure and diagnostic equipment were considered as important barriers in implementing contracts in primary care. Primary health care in a rural setting in Crete is engaged in setting up systems for implementing clinical governance and quality programs. The Regional Authorities of Health and Welfare should provide further support.

In Crete, the largest island of Greece, many pesticide formulations are increasingly used in agriculture in order to raise crop production. This study reviews a number of pesticide poisoning cases registered at the Center of Toxicology and Forensic Sciences Research at the University of Crete between 1991 and 2001. The medical records and toxicological data of the pesticide poisonings are presented. The analyzed samples were mainly blood and/or urine, but also gastric fluids and other tissues. Analysis involved a variety of techniques. Eleven poisonings caused by paraquat (7 men, 4 women, aged 15-58 years) are reported, five of which had fatal outcome. Initial paraquat plasma levels ranged between 0.4-165 pg/ml. Thirteen intoxications due to various organophosphorous agents are presented (11 men, 2 women, aged 13-69 years). Pesticide blood levels upon admission ranged from 1.0-108 pg/ml and there were six fatalities. Carbamate poisonings (4 men, 2 women, aged 32-60 years) were caused by methomyl (initial blood levels 1.6-57 mg/l) and resulted in death. A case of methyl bromide intoxication is also presented. The results of the study highlight the toxic and potentially lethal effects of pesticide formulations used in agriculture. Special seminars should be run to educate farmers on the proper use of these agents and the supply of pesticides should be restricted to those who follow all safety measures. Physicians should be trained to promptly identify and treat pesticide intoxications.

The aim of this study was to reveal differences in the epidemiology and to identify significant risk factors for cutaneous melanoma (CM) in a relatively dark-skinned, chronically sun-exposed Caucasian population. This group is considered to have a low risk for this tumour. One hundred and ten newly diagnosed patients with primary CM and 110 age- and gender-matched controls, all of Cretan origin, were interviewed and underwent a complete skin examination. Solar keratoses odds ratio (OR) 6.2 and lentigines (OR 2.2), common and atypical naevi (OR 5.4 and 3.0, respectively), blonde or red hair colour (OR 3.1), skin phototypes I/II (OR 1.8), as well as total sun exposure (weeks per year) (OR 1.03), were all significantly associated with CM risk in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. In the relatively dark-skinned Cretan population, sun exposure indices represent the most important risk markers for CM which contrasts with data from fair-skinned Caucasian populations where melanocytic naevi are the main risk factors.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of five consecutive cases of infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and the prevalence of faecal carriage of VRE among patients admitted to a 700-bed university hospital where no VRE had been isolated previously. In a 2-month period, five consecutive patients infected with VRE were detected. Three VanB+ Enterococcus faecium isolates were obtained from three patients, while two VanA+ E. faecium isolates, one VanA+ Enterococcus faecalis isolate and one VanC1+ Enterococcus gallinarum isolate were obtained from the other two patients. Of 218 faecal specimens from all hospital wards, 41 (18.8%) were found to contain VRE. Forty-two isolates of VRE were obtained, comprising one (2%) E. faecalis, 11 (27%) E. faecium, 24 (57%) E. gallinarum and six (14%) Enterococcus casseliflavus/flavescens. Four isolates carried the vanA gene, eight carried vanB, 24 carried vanC1, and six carried vanC2/C3. Use of glycopeptides, the presence of central venous catheters and renal dialysis all correlated with VRE colonisation. The prevalence rates were among the highest reported in the literature.

"Long-chain n-3 PUFA from fish oils are known to have anti-inflammatory effects. We evaluated the effect of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), precursor of n-3 fatty acids, on serum inflammatory markers and soluble cellular adhesion molecules (sCAM) of dyslipidaemic males, relative to their background diet. Participants were assigned to two groups, based upon food intake patterns: (a) twenty-one dyslipidaemic subjects who habitually ate a Mediterranean-Cretan-type diet; (b) nineteen dyslipidaemic subjects who normally ate a Westernised Greek diet. All were supplemented with 8.1 g ALA/d for 12 weeks. We determined serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF), IL-6, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and soluble E-selectin concentrations at the beginning and the end of the ALA supplementation period. Serum baseline concentrations of inflammatory markers and sCAM were similar across the diet groups. Type of diet had a significant impact on the response of inflammatory markers to ALA supplementation. The Westernised Greek diet group showed a reduction in SAA (P&lt;0.001), CRP (P=0.002), MCSF (P=0.005) and IL-6 (P=0.04) concentrations. The Mediterranean-Cretan-type background diet group showed a significant reduction only in MCSF concentrations (P=0.003). The sVCAM-1 concentrations were significantly reduced in both the Westernised Greek diet group (P=0.001) and the Mediterranean-Cretan-type diet group (P&lt;0.001). The present study demonstrated that ALA supplementation lowered the serum concentrations of inflammatory markers more profoundly when the background diet was rich in saturated fatty acids and poor in MUFA."

To study the incidence of toxoplasmosis in pregnant women in Crete and to test a designed protocol for handling those at risk of delivering congenitally infected infants. Pregnant women were screened serologically over a period of 5 years. Cases with suspected acute toxoplasmosis were treated, peripheral blood (PB), and amniotic fluid (AF) tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture, and fetuses monitored by ultrasonography. The absence of congenital infection in infants was confirmed by serology and clinical evaluation. Of the 5532 pregnant women followed, 70.57% remained seronegative, 29.45% were seropositive, and there was direct evidence of seroconversion in six cases. Acute toxoplasmosis was suspected in 185 cases, maternal parasitemia was detected in five cases and positive amniotic fluid in one case. Congenital infection was excluded in all infants followed, based on the absence of ultrasound findings in utero, lack of clinical symptoms at birth, negative Western blotting (WB) at birth and 3 months later, and descending serology for a year. Overall, 29.45% of the pregnant women followed were seropositive, 3.3% with suspected acute toxoplasmosis, and in 0.02% cases there was evidence of maternofetal transmission. The protocol tested allowed differentiation between acute and latent toxoplasmosis, safe management of the cases at risk and assisted in avoidance of unwarranted pregnancy terminations.

The prevalence of thrombophilic traits, which might further enhance the risk of thrombotic complications in children treated for cancer, varies significantly among different populations. To evaluate the prevalence of common thrombophilic traits of the East Mediterranean Region, among native Cretan children treated for malignancy. Blood samples were consecutively collected from 31 native Cretan children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 19) or other malignancies (n = 12) over 3 years. A molecular diagnosis based on the presence of Factor V Leiden (FVL), as well as on PT G20210A and MTHFR C677T mutation (in 14 patients) using PCR was applied. Patients who had central venous catheters (n = 29) were treated with an intensified thromboprophylaxis protocol that had been previously established in our institution. The prevalence of the FVL mutation was 19.4% (95% CI = 5-32). The allele frequency is estimated at 11.3% (95% CI: 3.5-19.1) which is higher than that reported for the population of the mainland of Greece. The prevalence of the PT G20210A and MTHFR C677T mutation was 14.3 and 71.4%, respectively (corresponding allele frequencies 7.1 and 50%, respectively). Only one patient developed thrombosis, having although no thrombophilic trait. Thrombophilic traits were relatively common in this group of native Cretan children treated for malignancy. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered in Cretan children in the presence of known acquired risk factors for thrombosis, but a larger prospective to study is first needed.
PMID:15612292	Gantenbein B, Keightley PD	Evolution. 58(11):2486-97	2004	Rates of molecular evolution in nuclear genes of east Mediterranean scorpions. 	Scorpions of the genus Mesobuthus represent a useful terrestrial model system for studying molecular evolution. They are distributed on several Aegean islands and the adjacent mainland, they are believed to have low rates of dispersal, and evolutionary divergence dates of taxa are available based on biogeographic events that separated islands from each other and the mainland. Here, we present data on polymorphism and synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rates for nine nuclear protein-coding genes of two east Mediterranean scorpion species, Mesobuthus gibbosus and M. cyprius (Buthidae). Levels of polymorphism tend to be lower in populations from islands (mean nucleotide diversity pi = 0.0071 +/- 0.0028) than in mainland populations (mean pi = 0.0201 +/- 0.0085). By using linear regression of genetic divergence versus isolation time, we estimate Ks to be 3.17 +/- 1.54 per (site x 10(9) years), and Ka to be 0.39 +/- 0.94 per (site x 10(9) years). These estimates for both Ks and Ka are considerably lower than for many other invertebrates, such as Drosophila, and may be attributed to scorpions' mammal-like generation times (approximately 2 years) and low metabolic rates. Phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood revealed a phylogeny that is congruent with that expected based on biogeographic events and in which divergences at synonymous sites are proportional to the dates that the taxa are believed to have split. Tests of equality of branch lengths for the Cyprus and Crete lineages revealed that Ks-estimates are about the same in both lineages, as expected from the biogeographic events that separated the islands, but Ka was increased in the Cyprus lineage compared to the Cretan lineage.

"The chemical composition of the essential oils obtained from the species restricted to Greece and the eastern Mediterranean region, Satureja spinosa L. and Thymus longicaulis L.; species endemic to central and south Greece, Satureja parnassica ssp. parnassica Heldr. and Sart ex Boiss.; species endemic to the island of Crete, Origanum dictamnus L.; and species widely distributed in the Mediterranean region, Satureja thymbra L. and Origanum vulgare L. subsp. hirtum, were determined by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The in vitro antibacterial activities of the essential oils were evaluated against a panel of five foodborne bacteria (Escherichia coli 0157:H7 NCTC 12900, Salmonella enteritidis PT4, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Listeria monocytogenes ScottA, and Bacillus cereus FSS 134). The analytical data indicated that various monoterpene hydrocarbons and phenolic monoterpenes constitute the major components of the oils, but their concentrations varied greatly among the oils examined. The antibacterial assay results showed that 5 muL doses of the essential oils extracted from the endemic Satureja species in Greece possess remarkable bactericidal properties, which are clearly superior as compared to those of Origanum and Thymus species essential oils. Therefore, they represent an inexpensive source of natural mixtures of antibacterial compounds that exhibit potentials for use in food systems to prevent the growth of foodborne bacteria and extend the shelf life of the processed food."

"To measure the prevalence of allergic rhinitis, atopy, and asthma among grape farmers, and to compare the respiratory and atopic status in grape farmers with those of nonexposed control subjects. Cross-sectional study. Malevisi region in northern Crete, Greece. One hundred twenty grape farmers and 100 control subjects living in the Malevisi region were examined. The protocol comprised a questionnaire, skin prick tests for 16 common allergens, measurement of specific IgE antibodies against 8 allergens, and spirometry before and after bronchodilation. Grape farmers were found to have an excess of respiratory symptoms. The comparison with the control group, after adjusting for age, sex, and smoking status, showed that the differences were statistically significant for rhinorrhea (odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 5.1; p &lt; 0.001), sneezing (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.0; p &lt; 0.01), and nasal itching (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.6; p &lt; 0.05), but were nonsignificant for asthma-related symptoms. In the multiple logistic regression model, grape farmers were found to have increased work-related symptoms, such as sneezing (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 6.6; p &lt; 01), rhinorrhea (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 6.6; p &lt; 0.01), cough (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 11.4; p &lt; 0.05), and dyspnea (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.3; p &lt; 0.05). The prevalence of allergic rhinitis was 40.8% in grape farmers and 26% in control subjects (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5; p &lt; 0.02). Increased but statistically nonsignificant values of asthma prevalence were found in grape farmers (6.7%) compared with the control group (2.0%). The prevalence of atopy was 64.2% in grape farmers and 38.0% in the control group (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.5; p &lt; 0.01). Mean FEV1 was significantly lower in grape farmers than in control subjects (p &lt; 0.05), after adjusting for age, sex, and smoking status. Bronchial obstruction was reversible in 23 grape farmers (19.2%) and in 6 control subjects (6%; p &lt; 0.01). The study mainly demonstrated the high prevalence of allergic rhinitis and work-related respiratory symptoms in grape farmers compared to control subjects. It also suggested that grape farming is possibly associated with increased allergic sensitization to specific pollens, low baseline FEV1, and increased bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Further studies are needed to determine the potential risk factors for these disorders among the farming population."

"BACKGROUND: Several researchers have claimed that classification of tumours on the basis of HER-2/neu overexpression or amplification may define a subset of breast cancer in which the net effect of a risk factor could be rather more obvious and its impact on breast cancer development more clear. We decided to investigate, in a group of patients from a geographical area with a low incidence of breast cancer, whether HER-2/neu positive tumours are correlated with established or suspected risk factors for breast cancer and thus to identify distinct subgroups of high risk women. METHODS: This study analysed data from patients who attended the Breast Unit at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece between 1996 and 2002. 384 women with primary invasive breast cancer were compared with 566 screened women who were referred to the Unit and had not developed breast neoplasm by the time the data were analysed. Risk factor data were obtained from each subject by personal interviews using a structured questionnaire. The detection and scoring of the HER-2/neu protein, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression were performed using immunochemistry. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were determined by chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. Case-case odds ratios were calculated in order to measure the risk heterogeneity between HER-2/neu+ and HER-2/neu-tumours. Separate analyses were performed for premenopausal and postmenopausal women and according to estrogen receptor status. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis without HER-2/neu stratification, an increased breast cancer risk was associated with only four of the factors examined: use of oral contraceptives (OR = 4.40, 95%C.I: 1.46-13.28), use of HRT (OR = 7.34, 95%C.I: 2.03-26.53), an age at first full pregnancy more than 23 years (OR = 1.91, 95%C.I: 1.29-2.83) and body mass index more than 29 kg/m2 (OR = 3.13, 95%C.I: 2.02-4.84). Additionally, a history of abortion or miscarriage (OR = 0.56, 95%C.I: 0.38-0.82) was correlated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. In the case to case comparison only BMI &gt;29 kg/m2 revealed a relative connection that was stronger with positive than with negative HER-2/neu tumours (ratio of OR's = 2.23, 95%C.I: 1.20-4.15, p = 0.011). This may indicate evidence of heterogeneity of a rather significant degree for this factor. In the ER negative group an age at first full pregnancy &gt;23 years and a BMI &gt;29 kg/m2 were associated with an increased risk in both HER-2/neu groups, but the association was significantly stronger for the latter factor in the positive HER-2/neu tumours (ratio of OR's = 2.46, 95%CI: 0.97-6.21). CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not confirm that the established or putative hormonal breast cancer risk factors differ regarding their relations with HER-2/neu+ versus HER-2/neu-breast tumours, with the exception of increased BMI. Further innovative studies with larger sample sizes are needed to examine how the status of these potentially modifiable breast cancer risk factors interacts with biological markers such as HER-2/neu oncoprotein."

The resistance levels to alpha-cypermethrin, bifenthrin, pirimiphos-methyl, endosulfan and imidacloprid were determined in Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) from Crete. Five B tabaci populations collected from greenhouse and outdoor crops were bioassayed and compared with a reference susceptible strain. Bemisia tabaci collected in a floriculture greenhouse exhibited the highest resistance against all insecticides: at LC50, resistance factors were 23-fold for bifenthrin, 80-fold for alpha-cypermethrin, 18-fold for pirimiphos-methyl, 58-fold for endosulfan and 730-fold for imidacloprid. A population collected on outdoor melons was more susceptible than the reference strain against all insecticides tested, suggesting the occurrence of local highly susceptible B tabaci populations in 'refugia'. In pairwise comparisons of resistance levels, correlation was observed between the LC50 values of the pyrethroid insecticides bifenthrin and alpha-cypermethrin.

The healthcare environment is currently changing and the health sector is being transformed to meet new challenges and to benefit from new opportunities. Priorities for the 21st century ought to be set based on emerging dominant trends in healthcare, including the shift towards shared or integrated care, in which an individual's healthcare is the responsibility of a team of professionals across all levels of the healthcare system hierarchy. In addition to the requirement for efficient and secure access to the Integrated Electronic Health Record (I-EHR) of a citizen, this necessitates the development and deployment of Regional Health Information Networks (RHINs), synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services, and novel eHealth and mHealth services, facilitated by intelligent sensors, monitoring devices, hand-held or wearable technologies, the Internet and wireless broadband communications. These further require the adoption of an open Reference Architecture and the creation of a scalable Health Information Infrastructure (HII).This paper discusses the challenges encountered in developing and deploying HYGEIAnet, the Regional Health Information Network of Crete, as well as relevant benefits for citizens and health professionals. Furthermore, HYGEIAnet systems and services are presented, with emphasis on the development of the HII and the implementation of the I-EHR service for providing secure, role-based access to validated content by authorized and authenticated users.

Five barley chloroplast DNA microsatellites (cpSSRs) were used to study genetic relationships among a set of 186 barley accessions-34 Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum (HS accessions) from Morocco, Ethiopia, Cyprus, Crete, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan and Israel, 122 H. vulgare ssp. vulgare landraces (HV landraces) from Spain, Bolivia (old Spanish introductions), Morocco, Libya and Ethiopia and 20 modern European spring barleys (HV cultivars). All loci were polymorphic in the material studied, with the number of alleles per locus ranging from two to three. Fifteen multi-locus haplotypes were observed, 11 in HS accessions and seven in HV landraces and cultivars. Of the seven haplotypes found in the HV lines, three were shared with the HS accessions, and four were unique. Cluster analysis revealed two main groups, one consisting of HS accessions from Ethiopia and the HV landraces from Spain, Bolivia (old Spanish), Morocco and Ethiopia, whereas the other larger group contained all of the other accessions studied. Based on these grouping and the existence of haplotypes found in the HV landraces and cultivars but not in the HS wild barley, a polyphyletic origin is proposed for barley, with further centres of origin in Ethiopia and the Western Mediterranean.

(Cretan dittany), growing under various electrical conductivity (EC) levels (2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 mS/cm), was studied, using the nutrient film technique (NFT). The analysis of the essential oil content was achieved by GC-MS technique, and totals of 41 and 38 different compounds were identified in both cases of large-leaved and narrow-leaved samples of leaves and bracts, respectively. Differences in the composition content and of the percentage of each of the constituents in the two studied samples (i.e., large-leaved and narrow-leaved) and within the essential oils of leaves and bracts in both samples were observed. Carvacrol and p-cymene were identified as the main constituents in all essential oils, whereas thymoquinone was found in higher percentage in the essential oils of large-leaved than in narrow-leaved plants. The results obtained from GC-MS analysis were submitted to chemometric analysis, and a phenotypic similarity of the essential oils of narrow-leaved O. dictamnus was observed, whereas the essential oils of large-leaved O. dictamnus showed two separate subgroups.

This study investigated the impact of subjective reports of drowsy driving and non-driving duties on the falling asleep responses and road crash involvement of professional drivers in Crete. An attempt was also made to elucidate other driving parameters, such as freight transportation, which could be potential predictors of risky driving, after controlling for lifestyle patterns. A sample of 317 professional drivers was studied through personal interviews. The interview questionnaire included items about sleep and fatigue as contributing factors to falling asleep probability and crash risk. In addition, the drivers reported the type of freight they carried in their last trip, as well as practices such as smoking and alcohol consumption. The first logistic regression analysis showed that the most significant predictors of falling asleep at the wheel were transportation of fruits/vegetables and livestock, non-driving hours of work, insufficient hours of sleep, and smoking. The second logistic regression analysis revealed all the previous items as powerful factors of crash probability, including the transportation of express freight and freezer. The findings of the current study are discussed as they pertain to directions for future studies and for the development of fatigue countermeasures.

Locally grown, wild food plants seasonally contribute a considerable portion of the daily diet in certain Mediterranean areas and it has been suggested that the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet on human health partly originate from the antioxidant effect of flavonoid-rich food plants. The nutrient content of most wild plants is higher than that of cultivated ones and may vary depending on the prevailing environmental conditions. Accordingly, three local Mediterranean plant foods (i.e. Cichorium intybus, Sonchus oleraceus, Papaver rhoeas) were collected in Greece (Crete), southern Italy, and southern Spain in order to assess possible differences in their in vitro antioxidant potential. The biological assays revealed diverse intra-plant specific antioxidant effects for the tested extracts ranging from no activity to almost complete protection. Furthermore, substantial differences in the polyphenol content were found for the nutritionally used part of the same plant originating from different locations. However, no clear correlations between the polyphenol content and the extracts' antioxidant activities were found. Taken together, the data suggest that certain local Mediterranean plant foods possess promising antioxidant activity and that the observed biological effects are possibly influenced by the geographically-dependent environmental conditions prevailing during plant growth.

Numerous bioactive chemical compounds of plant origin may influence the angiogenic activity of various cell types and may thus affect the formation of blood vessels. Here we present the angiogenic effects of extracts of edible plants collected in Crete, Southern Italy and Southern Spain. Extracts have been applied to cultured human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human keratinocytes (HaCaT). About half out of 96 extracts exerted an inhibitory effect on HMEC-1 proliferation. Additionally, we have noted the inhibitory effects of extracts on HUVEC differentiation on a Matrigel layer. None of the extracts showed a stimulatory activity. The extract of Thymus piperella exerted moderate inhibitory effect on cobalt-chloride induced VEGF synthesis, however, CoCl(2)-induced activation of hypoxia responsive element of VEGF promoter was significantly attenuated only by extract of Origanum heracleoticum. Our study indicates that extracts of local food plants, of potential value as nutraceuticals, contain chemical compounds which may inhibit angiogenesis. Demonstration of their real influence on human health requires, however, extensive animal studies and controlled clinical investigations.

The aim of the present study was to identify any possible protective effects of wild greens on certain biochemical cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in elderly women leaving in rural Crete. For the needs of the study a region with high consumption of wild greens (Avdou) and a region with low consumption (Anogia) were identified and a representative population from each area was recruited (n= 37 and n=35 respectively). Serum lipids and fibrinogen levels, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), soluble intercellular adhesion molucule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble vascular adhesion molucule-1 (s-ICAM-1) and haematological factors were measured in both regions during winter and summer time when wild-green plants consumption is high and low, respectively. Regarding classic lipid risk factors for arteriosclerosis no significant different between the two regions were detected. TAC was found higher in Avdou compared to Anogia during winter screening, but null in both regions during summer. Fibrinogen was found higher in Avdou compared to Anogia while no differences between the two regions were detected for sVCAM-1 and s-ICAM-1 in both screenings. The significantly higher TAC and fibrinogen values detected in Avdou could be attributed to the higher wild green consumption in that region since recent data indicated that their content in vitamin C and E as well as flavonoids is particularly high.

In 1960, all male inhabitants of a series of villages in rural Crete, born between 1900 and 1919, were invited to participate in the Seven Countries Study. Analysis of 25-year mortality data from the 16 cohorts of participants indicated that the cohort from Crete had the lowest age-standardised all-cause and coronary heart disease death rates. At baseline, 686 Cretan men (98% of those invited) participated in health examinations. Mortality data were collected over 40 years. Time-fixed and updated covariate survival analysis techniques were applied to assess eight cardiovascular disease risk factors as long-term predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. The median survival time was 32 years. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates were 26 and 11 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Age (relative risk 1.11, 95% CI 1.09-1.13), diastolic blood pressure (relative risk 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), and smoking (relative risk 1.37, 95% CI 1.14-1.64) were positively associated and forced expiratory volume (relative risk 0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.68) was negatively associated with all-cause mortality. Age (relative risk 1.13, 95% CI 1.09-1.16), diastolic blood pressure (relative risk 1.01, 95% CI 1.001-1.03), and forced expiratory volume (relative risk 0.53, 95% CI 0.32-0.89) were independent predictors of cardiovascular mortality. Serum cholesterol concentration and body mass index were not independently associated with death risk. The Cretan cohort displays favourable 40-year survival. Even so, long-term predictors of the hazard of both all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality are present.

"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The disorder is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, encoding a copper transporting P-type ATPase. The worldwide incidence is in the order of 30 cases per million, with a gene frequency of 0.56% and a carrier frequency of 1 in 90. The increased number of Wilson disease patients in the island of Crete led us to study the spectrum of mutations in a small village close to the city of Heraklion, from where many patients have been referred during the last 25 years. In order to estimate the frequency of the disease, we firstly investigated the number of births and the number of WD patients in the village since 1978. Six out of 90 births were diagnosed as WD patients, presenting the highest prevalence of WD reported so far. Analysis of the whole gene in three Wilson disease patients, and relatives of a boy who died from WD, led to the detection of 4 different point mutations. Two of them were missense (p.I1148T and p.G1176R) and cosegregated in cis in the same patient; the other allele of this patient carried a nonsense mutation (p.Q289X). This is the first report in the literature of three mutations co-segregating in the same WD patient. The fourth mutation identified was a novel frameshift mutation (c.398delT) with documented cosegregation. When screening 200 inhabitants originating from the same area, 18 were found to be carriers of one of these mutations. These findings indicate the need for health education intervention, genetic counselling and newborn screening for the Wilson disease."

Water samples taken at three depth layers from the offshore oligotrophic Cretan Sea were analyzed for ultraphytoplankton size fractionation using different methods: (a) sequential filtration on filters of pore size 5, 1 and 0.2 microm, (b) separate filtration using filters 5 and 0.2 microm as well as 1 and 0.2 microm and (c) direct filtration on 0.2 microm filters after staining of the samples with DAPI. Total abundance of photosynthetic organisms as well as the abundance of different groups such as flagellates and cyanobacteria measured by means of sizing after DAPI staining were significantly higher than those obtained by the other methods. This indicates that although there were no significant differences between the estimates provided by the separate and sequential filtration, both these methods underestimated total abundance by at least 25-50%. The estimates for the size fractions were also found to range from relatively imprecise to completely unreliable depending on the group and the size range. Although size fractionation through direct observation after staining largely depends on the expertise of the observer, this study suggests that it may provide more informative estimates than the other two methods. Although it is difficult to generalize the results of this study in a global context, the paper provides strong indications on the limitations of the sequential and separate methods for size fractionation of photosynthetic organisms and implies that their results are likely to be less accurate than is presently believed.

"Primary health care (PHC) is increasingly being introduced into undergraduate medical education. In Greece, the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Crete was the first to introduce a 4-week long training in primary health care. This paper presents the experiences gained from the initial implementation of the teaching of practice-based primary care in rural Crete and reports on the assessment scale that was developed. 284 students' case write-ups from the 6 primary care units (PCUs) where they were allocated for the period 1990 to 1994 were analysed. The demographic data of the students and patients and the number of home visits were studied. Content analysis of the students' write-ups was carried out, using an assessment scale consisting of 10 dichotomous variables, in order to quantify eight (8) primary qualitative criteria. Internal reliability was estimated by the index KR20 = 0.67. Face and content validity was found to conform to the standards set for the course, while logistic linear regression analysis showed that the quality criteria could be used as an assessment scale. The number of home visits carried out varied between the various different PCUs (p &lt; 0.001) and more were reported in the write-ups that fulfilled criteria related to the biopsychosocial approach (p &lt; 0.05). Nine quantitative criteria were fulfilled in more than 90% of case reports, but laboratory investigations were reported only in 69.0% of case reports. Statistically significant differences between the PCUs were observed in the fulfilment of criteria related to the community approach, patient assessment and information related to the patient's perception of the illness, but not to those related to aspects of clinical patient management. Differences in reporting laboratory investigations (p &lt; 0.001) are explained by the lack of such facilities in some PCUs. Demographic characteristics of the patients or the students' do not affect the criteria. The primary health care course achieved the objectives of introducing students to comprehensive, community oriented care, although there was variation between the PCUs. The assessment scale that was developed to analyse the case-write ups of the students provided data that can be used to evaluate the course."

Hb Crete, an electrophoretically neutral, unstable, high oxygen affinity variant, was characterized by protein and DNA analyses in the homozygous state in a 32-year-old woman from Crete, with erythrocytosis and microcytosis. The proband and members of her family over 3 generations, including 5 carriers of Hb Crete, were subject to clinical, hematological and biochemical investigations, and DNA, RNA and protein studies were carried out. The proband demonstrated features associated with disturbed hemoglobin (Hb) structure and function, including erythrocytosis and additionally a state of functional anemia, the latter reflected by increased erythropoetin levels and cardiac output. In addition, all the carriers surprisingly had hematological and biosynthetic findings more usually associated with thalassemia trait. The structural change in Hb Crete only partly explains all the pathological manifestations of this variant, and other mechanisms are discussed.

"In this study, an attempt was made to analyze time series of air quality measurements (O3, SO2, SO4(2-), NOx) conducted at a remote place in the eastern Mediterranean (Finokalia at Crete Island in 1999) to obtain concrete information on potential contributions from emission sources. For the definition of a source-receptor relationship, advanced meteorological and dispersion models appropriate to identify ""areas of influence"" have been used. The model tools used are the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System and the Lagrangian-type particle dispersion model (forward and backward in time), with capabilities to derive influence functions and definition of ""areas of influence."" When high levels of pollutants have been measured at the remote location of Finokalia, particles are released from this location (receptor) and traced backward in time. The influence function derived from particle distributions characterizes dispersion conditions in the atmosphere and also provides information on potential contributions from emission sources within the modeling domain to this high concentration. As was shown in the simulation results, the experimental site of Finokalia in Crete is influenced during the selected case studies, primarily by pollutants emitted from the urban conglomerate of Athens. Secondarily, it is influenced by polluted air masses arriving from Italy and/or the Black Sea Region. For some specific cases, air pollutants monitored at Finokalia were possibly related to war activities in the West Balkan Region (Kosovo)."

"Through its powerful immunoregulatory effects, infection with atypical mycobacteria may exert a protective effect on the development of childhood allergic disease. To examine the relationship between childhood atopy or allergic disease and previous infection with four species of atypical mycobacteria. Eight hundred and six children aged 8-18 years and living in rural Crete--most of whom had had previous BCG immunization--underwent skin prick testing with 10 aeroallergens; their parents completed a standardized questionnaire relating to allergic disease. No less than 8 weeks later each child underwent intradermal skin tests with 0.1 mL solutions of four selected mycobacterial reagents (Aviumin C, Gordonin, Chelonin and Ranin I). Twenty-three percent of children were atopic on skin prick testing; far fewer had symptoms of asthma (5%) or hayfever in conjunction with a positive prick test to pollens (2%). Eighty percent of children had positive skin responses to one or more mycobacterial species. Among all children--and those with a BCG scar--there was no association between atopy or allergic symptoms and mycobacterial skin responses; among the few children without a BCG scar however those with positive mycobacterial responses were less likely to be atopic or to report allergic symptoms; these differences were not statistically significant. Our findings, in a population of BCG-immunized children, do not lend support to the suggestion that infection with atypical mycobacteria is protective against childhood allergic disease."

"In Greece, prevalence of cardiovascular disease has been increasing during the last few decades. From a public health point of view, it is important to identify lifestyle practices associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors. As part of the Clinical Nutrition course at the University of Crete School of Medicine, 507 medical students (292 men, 215 women) were examined during the period 1995-2001. Individual 24-hour dietary recalls were taken, lifestyle questionnaires were completed, and anthropometric and serum lipid measurements were performed. Fruits and vegetables were consumed by 90% of men (370 +/- 275 g/day) and 94% of women (354 +/- 283 g/day). Among non/ex-smokers who ate fruit and vegetables, 41% consumed &gt; or = 400 g/day, compared to 31% of current smokers (p = 0.05).

"Wohlfahrtia magnifica is the main agent of traumatic myiasis in the southern Palaearctic zone. It was recorded in outbreak situations in Crete, Greece, for the first time in 1999, causing widespread production losses and considerable concern in the livestock sectors. Most commonly applied curative insecticides, organophosphates and pyrethroids, can kill larvae of W. magnifica, but they do not provide long-term protection from infestation or re-infestation, which would facilitate wound healing. The objective of the present work was to study the seasonal dynamics of sheep wohlfahrtiosis in Crete and to determine the prophylactic efficacy of dicyclanil, an insect growth regulator, against natural infestations by larvae of W. magnifica. Six sheep flocks were studied, three from a semi-intensive husbandry system and three from an extensive husbandry system. Two flocks were kept as untreated controls and also were used to study the disease dynamics. Dicyclanil was strategically applied just to males and young non-milking females in four treatment flocks; milking females in these flocks were not treated. The untreated flocks demonstrated seasonal patterns in case numbers that were associated with changes in climate and husbandry activities, especially reproduction and shearing. Cases were most common on the genitalia (60%) and a greater proportion of males than females were infested. The prophylactic efficacy of dicyclanil in males was up to 91.3% over the entire trial period. Hence the incidence in treated males at 22 weeks, when final infestations were recorded, was 5-10% compared to 45-55% in untreated controls. Moreover, the application of dicyclanil to a limited number of animals per flock (males and non-milking females=c. 15-20% of the flock) significantly reduced the incidence of wohlfahrtiosis even in the untreated animals. Hence, final overall incidences in the treated flocks ranged from 4.5 to 5.5% compared to 13.3-13.4% in the control flocks."
PMID:15946107	Vivilaki V, Romanidou A, Theodorakis P, Lionis C	Rural Remote Health. 5(2):376	2005	Are health education meetings effective in recruiting women in cervical screening programmes? An innovative and inexpensive intervention from the island of Crete. 	Cervical screening programs have been introduced in many countries and are generally regarded as the most appropriate and effective method currently available for preventing cervical cancer. Although action has been undertaken by some rural practitioners, especially by district midwives, there are still few published data on the effectiveness of community-oriented cervical screening programs in Greece. To explore an innovative approach in a primary-care setting in rural Crete. This study reports on the effectiveness of a health education meeting in recruiting women for a cervical screening program. At a centre for the elderly, 16 women participated in an educational discussion meeting organised to promote cervical screening. The women who participated in the discussion meeting were invited to organise a group visit to a rural primary healthcare centre, in order to be screened as a team during the following 15 days. The theoretical model underpinning the development of this intervention was based on the 'social learning theory'. Emphasis was placed up individual and social responsibility regarding cervical cancer. A total number of 48 women (average age 62 years) including all those who participated in the educational discussion meeting, visited the Spili Health Center, Crete, 15 days after the discussion meeting. The main finding was the high compliance rate of the women who participated in the educational discussion meeting, resulting in recruiting all the initial participants. Moreover, the lay women who participated in the small group discussion meeting, in the capacity of key messengers convinced an additional 32 women to participate in a screening program for cervical cancer as members of a team, rather than individually. The majority (52.1%, n = 25 out of 48) of the women had not been previously screened for cervical cancer. Health education is an important factor in the process of health promotion, and health professionals should consider the dynamics of a specific group in order to carry out their work effectively. Awareness of the special characteristics of an individual as a member of a defined group can contribute to increasing the motivation for participation in health programs as a member of that group. It is suggested that more educational programs take place in rural Crete in order to augment the compliance rate of women in cervical screening programs.

Wall lizards of the genus Podarcis (Sauria, Lacertidae) comprise 17 currently recognized species in southern Europe, where they are the predominant reptile group. The taxonomy of Podarcis is complex and unstable. Based on DNA sequence data the species of Podarcis falls into four main groups that have substantial geographical conherence (western island group, southwestern group, Italian group and Balkan group). The Balkan species are divided in two subgroups: the subgroup of Podarcis taurica (P. taurica, P. milensis, P. gaigeae and perhaps P. melisellensis), and the subgroup of Podarcis erhardii (P. erhardii and P. peloponnesiaca). We addressed the question of phylogenetic relations among the species of the P. taurica subgroup encountered in Greece, as they can be inferred from partial mtDNA (cyt b and 16S) sequences. Our data support the monophyly of P. taurica subgroup and suggest that P. gaigeae, P. milensis and P. melisellensis form a clade, which thereinafter connects to P. taurica. Within the previous clade, P. gaigeae is more closely related to P. milensis than to P. melisellensis. However, the specimens of P. taurica were subdivided in two different groups. The first one includes the specimens from northeastern Greece, and the other group includes the specimens from the rest of continental Greece and Ionian islands. Because the molecular clock of the cyt b and 16 rRNA genes was not rejected in our model test, it is possible to estimate times of speciation events. Based on the splitting of the island of Crete from Peloponnisos [c. 5 million years ago (Ma)], the evolutionary rate for the cyt b is 1.55% per million years (Myr) and for the 16S rRNA is 0.46% per Myr. These results suggest that the evolutionary history of P. taurica in Greece is more complex than a single evolutionary invasion. The data analysed, stress the need for a reconsideration of the evolutionary history of Greek Podarcis species and help overcome difficulties that classical taxonomy has encountered at both the species level.

"To evaluate the clinical results of epi-LASIK, a new surface ablation surgical technique for the treatment of low myopia. Vardinoyannion Eye Institute of Crete, University of Crete, Greece. Forty-four eyes of 31 patients had epi-LASIK for the correction of low myopia. Mean preoperative spherical equivalent was 3.71 diopters (D) +/- 1.2 (SD) (range -1.75 to -7.00 D) and the mean baseline logMAR best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was -0.01 +/- 0.06 (range 0.10 to -0.10). All the epithelial separations were performed with the Centurion epikeratome (CIBA Surgical). The enrolled patients were followed daily until the epithelial healing was complete as well as at 1- and 3-month intervals. On the operative day, patients filled out a questionnaire grading visual performance and pain score of treated eyes every 2 hours for a total of 5 records. The mean epithelial healing time was 4.86 +/- 0.56 days (range 3 to 5 days). The mean logMAR uncorrected visual acuity on the day of reepithelization was 0.19 +/- 0.09 (range 0.40 to 0.10). At 1 month, the mean was spherical equivalent of the treated eyes (N=44), -0.3 +/- 0.6 D (range -1.0 to 0.87 D), and at 3 months it was (N=37), -0.10 +/- 0.4 D (range -0.75 to 0.75 D); 97% of eyes had clear corneas or trace haze 3 months after treatment. Preliminary clinical results suggest that epi-LASIK is a safe and efficient method for the correction of low myopia. Further studies will establish this method as an alternative surface ablation procedure."

"Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that maintains telomeres by adding telomeric TTAGGG repeats to the ends of human chromosomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate quantitatively the mRNA expression of telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) in different types of intracranial tumours in relation to their histologic pattern and grade and correlate it with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA levels were estimated by the use of real time RT-PCR in 68 samples of intracranial tumours. It revealed statistical correlation between hTERT mRNA expression levels and the grade of the tumours (P&lt;0.001). Patients having negative expression of hTERT mRNA had statistically longer PFS (P=0.031) and OS (P=0.047). Cox univariate regression analysis revealed that hTERT mRNA-positive patients had a high and statistically significant risk of relapse (hazard ratio (HR) of 2.24 and P=0.038). In the Cox multivariate regression model, the levels of hTERT mRNA were adjusted for tumour grade and patients age, and since there was statistically significant relationship between the levels of hTERT mRNA and the grade of the tumours (P=0.003 or P=0.006, respectively), hTERT mRNA levels could not be considered as an independent prognostic factor for PFS or OS."

"The bacterial community composition of marine surface sediments originating from various regions of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (12 sampling sites) was compared by parallel use of three fingerprinting methods: analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragment heterogeneity by denaturing gradient electrophoresis (DGGE), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and analysis of phospholipid-linked fatty acid composition (PLFA). Sampling sites were located at variable depths (30-2860 m; water column depth above the sediments) and the sediments differed greatly also in their degree of petroleum contamination (0.4-18 microg g(-1)), organic carbon (0.38-1.5%), and chlorophyll a content (0.01-7.7 microg g(-1)). Despite a high degree of correlation between the three different community fingerprint methods, some major differences were observed. DGGE banding patterns showed a significant separation of sediment communities from the northern, more productive waters of the Thermaikos Gulf and the oligotrophic waters of the Cretan, S. Ionian, and Levantine Sea. T-RFLP analysis clearly separated the communities of deep sediments (&gt;1494 m depth) from their shallow (&lt;617 m) counterparts. PLFA analysis grouped a shallow station from the productive waters of the north with the deep oligotrophic sediments from the Ionian and Levantine Sea, with low concentrations of PLFAs, and hence low microbial biomass, as the common denominator. The degree of petroleum contamination was not significantly correlated to the apparent composition of the microbial communities for any of the three methods, whereas organic carbon content and sediment chlorophyll a were important in this regard."

"We aimed at examining the intake of ready-to-eat cereals (RTEC) among adolescents in Crete, Greece, and investigate relationships with health and diet indicators. A sample of 392 adolescents (183 boys, 209 girls) aged 15 +/- 0.4 years, attending high schools of two major counties in Crete, was studied to determine consumption of RTEC using a frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements were performed and blood was drawn for analysis of serum lipoproteins and blood glucose (BG). The physical fitness was assessed with the 20-meter shuttle run test (SRT) and the amount of time watching television was estimated. Nutrient intakes were calculated through 24-hour dietary recalls. 42% (n = 77) of boys and 43% (n = 90) of girls reported consumption of RTEC at least once per week. Approximately 40% of the male and 47% of the female consumers reported eating RTEC only at meals other than breakfast. RTEC consumption was inversely related to the obesity indices and BG levels, and positively related to the SRT (p &lt; 0.05 in all analyses). RTEC consumers had significantly higher intakes of fibre, magnesium, calcium, iron, folate, and vitamins A, B2 and B6 (p &lt; 0.05 in all analyses). Our results demonstrated favourable associations between RTEC intake and health and diet indicators in Greek adolescents, with potential implications for improved health status and chronic disease risk reduction."

The current study examines the long-term effects of a school-based 'Health and Nutrition Education programme' on body mass index (BMI) changes and the prevalence of overweight. The intervention group consisted of all pupils registered in the first grade of two counties of the island of Crete in 1992, while all pupils registered in a third county formed the control group. For evaluation purposes, a representative sample was examined at baseline (1992) following the 6-y intervention (1998) and 4 y after the programme's cessation (2002). The data presented here are based on pupils with full anthropometrical data in all three examination periods (284 intervention group pupils and 257 control group pupils). Former intervention group pupils had lower average BMI (by 0.7 kg/m2, s.e. 0.28, P = 0.019) at the 10-y follow-up compared to the control group subjects, while no differences were detected in the prevalence of obesity between the two groups. The findings of the current study indicate that the beneficial effects of the programme on pupils' BMI continue, to an extent, 4 years after its cessation. However, the lack of significant differences in the prevalence of overweight between the two groups indicates that the effects of the intervention may not be equally distributed in the population, with greater effects in certain subgroups and less or none in others.

"Studies of the frequency and aetiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders in the general population have received increasing interest over the past few years; the field seems to be neglected in Southern Europe. The aim of this study was to report on the frequency of functional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and gastroenteritis within the primary care setting, to provide some information on the extent to which the recorded diagnoses in the physicians' notes fulfil existing diagnostic criteria. A retrospective study was used, where all new cases of these diseases at five primary health care centres in three rural and two semi-rural areas of Crete were identified by scrutinizing medical records from 280,000 consecutive visits during a 4 year period. The occurrence rate per 1000 person-years were calculated for the three conditions. We also checked the extent to which the Talley's criteria for FD and Rome II diagnostic criteria for IBS were followed. Gastroenteritis was revealed to be a quite frequent health problem among the rural population on Crete, while the occurrence rates for other problems, such as dyspepsia and IBS, were found to be lower than expected. IBS was over-represented among women compared with men, OR 2.04 (CI 1.39-3.00). In many cases a diagnosis of FD, IBS or gastroenteritis was evident to the research team on the basis of findings recorded in the notes, but the diagnosis was not recorded by the clinician at the time of consultation. This study yielded two key messages: the first that gastroenteritis is still a frequent health problem, and the second that primary care physicians in rural Crete seem to fail in adequately diagnosing FD and IBS and need further training."

"To determine the cause of sudden cardiac death in adults who underwent autopsy. Four hundred and forty-five sudden cardiac deaths occurred within 1 h of the symptoms onset, and all other cardiac and noncardiac causes having been excluded from autopsy and toxicology screening, were retrospectively identified from among 902 autopsies performed in a 2-year period on the island of Crete. The presence of acute coronary thrombi and myocardial infarction was documented macroscopically and by light microscopy and histology. In all 445 cases, at least one coronary artery had evidence of moderate to advanced atherosclerosis. About two thirds were between 50 and 70 years. Men had a higher incidence than women, but with advancing age (&gt;60 years) this difference was reduced. Myocardial infarction was found in 17 cases (11 acute; 6 acute and healed). Fifty-eight cases (13.0%) had coronary thrombi, mostly involving the left anterior descending and the right coronary arteries (81%); only six of these were associated with acute myocardial infarction. In our population, arrhythmia was the most common cause of sudden cardiac death, while acute coronary thrombi and acute myocardial infarction were detected only in some cases. Because of the heterogeneity in the cause of sudden cardiac deaths in adults, a detailed forensic investigation may provide important information on the cause of death and help in the development of primary and secondary prevention."

To assess the long-term safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability of conductive keratoplasty (CK) for the treatment of low to moderate hyperopia and to evaluate the impact of the procedure on the quality of vision. University of Crete, Medical School, Vardinoyannion Eye Institute of Crete, Crete, Greece. In this prospective nonrandomized noncontrolled single-center study, 38 eyes of 26 patients (13 women and 13 men) were treated for hyperopia with a Refractec ViewPoint CK system and followed for 30 months. Preoperatively, the mean manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) was +1.89 diopters (D) +/- 0.6 (SD) (range +1.00 to +3.25 D), and the mean follow-up was 30.9 +/- 1.1 months. All eyes were treated with the regular CK nomogram for the treatment of spherical hyperopia. The treatment consisted of 8 to 32 spots applied to the periphery of the cornea. Mean age was 50.3 +/- 8.8 years (range 31 to 71 years). All treated eyes were analyzed for safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability. At 12 months, the MRSE was -0.06 +/- 0.8 D and at 30 months was -0.02 +/- 0.7 D. At 30 months, the mean MRSE was within +/-0.50 D in 68%, within +/-1.00 D in 92%, and within +/-2.00 D in all eyes. At 30 months, uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 or better in 52.5% and 20/40 or better in 89% of eyes. No eye lost 2 or more Snellen lines or had an induced cylinder of 2.00 D or greater. The procedure did not cause statistically significant changes in contrast sensitivity. Results show that CK for low to moderate hyperopia is a safe, effective, predictable, and stable procedure.

The Mediterranean land snail genus Mastus (Beck, 1837) is highly divergent. Thirty-two Mastus species have been recorded throughout the genus range, and 23 of them are endemic to the islands of the Aegean Sea and mainland Greece. Of these, all 16 Mastus species reported from Crete are endemic to this island. A robust molecular phylogenetic framework based on mitochondrial and nuclear genes (1623 bp) allowed us to explore the temporal diversification pattern of lineages, using molecular clock approaches. Our results showed an initial radiation in the evolutionary history of the Cretan lineage, followed by a subsequent slowdown of lineage splitting rate. Using a dated major vicariant event of the Aegean area, we estimated the absolute time of the radiation event and proposed a biogeographic scenario accounting for the observed pattern. Additionally, we tried to infer the processes that led to the divergence of the Cretan Mastus species, by applying comparative methods in phylogenetically informated context. Overall, our results favoured a nonecological radiation scenario in the Cretan Mastus species due to an allopatric divergence of secondary sexual characters.

"To examine whether secular trends in adiposity and blood lipid profile of Greek children manifested equally among individuals from urban and rural provinces. Cretan boys (aged 12.1+/-2.3 y) from urban and rural areas of Crete were recruited in 1982 (n=277 and 251, respectively) and 2002 (n=440 and 180, respectively). Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI), as well as plasma lipid concentrations were measured and compared across cohorts (1982 vs 2002) and regions (urban vs rural) by two-way analysis of covariance (adjusted for age) with interaction. Temporal changes in height (positive), weight (positive), and BMI (positive) manifested equally in children from urban and rural provinces, as no interaction was detected. Similar results were obtained for triacylglycerol (positive), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, positive) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (negative) concentrations. A significant interaction was observed only for total cholesterol (TC), which increased from 1982 among rural (by 6.2%, p &lt; 0.05) but not among urban boys. In all other instances, regional differences in 1982 persisted in 2002. More specifically, children from urban provinces were taller, heavier, and had higher BMI values than those from rural areas, while they also had higher LDL-C concentrations, whether nowadays or 20 y ago. Regional differences in TC in 1982 were not apparent in 2002. These findings suggest that changes in anthropometric characteristics and plasma lipids during the past 20 y have occurred largely in parallel among urban and rural Cretan children, and they emphasize the importance of developing a common national strategy for the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity in Greece."

"Atmospheric processes governing the fate of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the atmosphere of the Eastern Mediterranean were studied for a two-year period (2000-2001). Atmospheric samples were collected off-shore over the Eastern Mediterranean Sea as well as at a background station in Northeastern Crete, Greece. PAH total concentration varied from 4.1 to 57.2 ng m(-3), with &gt;90% in the gas phase. Gas-to-particle distribution of PAHs was correlated (R2 0.75-0.98, p &lt; 0.001) with their subcooled vapor pressure. Seasonal changes in the total concentration of PAHs were not observed, while the origin of air mass was the dominant factor determining their atmospheric concentration levels. Air masses, originating from central and eastern Europe, were associated with the highest PAH concentrations. Gas-to-particle distribution of sigmaPAHs correlated well (R2 0.75-0.98, p &lt; 0.001) with their subcooled vapor pressure. Tropospheric ozone concentration correlated with the vapor-phase PAH concentration (p &lt; 0.001) but less (p &lt; 0.01) with the particulate PAH concentration. Distribution of volatile PAHs over the Eastern Mediterranean basin was uniform. Conversely, particulate PAH concentrations were higher at sampling sites located close to urban centers. Calculated relative removal rates of PAHs associated with particles were significantly higher than those of volatile members."

A one-year survey was conducted in the greater region of Crete (located at the lower region of the Aegean Sea) for the purpose of identifying waste composition (including chemical and physical characterization), as well as any seasonal variation. The investigation was carried out repeatedly at seven landfills and one transfer station in Crete, in four phases. Each sampling phase corresponded to a season (autumn, winter, spring, summer). ASTM D5231-92(2003) standard method and RCRA Waste Sampling Draft Technical Guidance were used. Hand sorting was used for classifying the collected wastes into the following categories: plastics, paper, metals, aluminium, leather-wood-textiles-rubbers, organic wastes, non-combustibles and miscellaneous. Further analysis included proximate and ultimate analysis of combustible materials. Metals such as lead, cadmium and mercury were also investigated. The results show that there has been a significant decrease of organic wastes during the last decade due to the increase of packaging materials, as a result of a change in consumption patterns. Three main waste categories were determined: organic wastes, paper and plastics, which combined represent 76% of the total waste in Crete. Furthermore, a high fraction of glass and a seasonal variation of aluminium indicate a strong correlation of waste composition with certain human activities, such as tourism. There is also a variation between the municipal solid waste (MSW) composition in the region of Crete (2003-2004) and MSW composition suggested in the National Solid Waste Planning (2000) [National Solid Waste Planning, 2000. Completion and particularization of Common Ministerial Act 113944//1944/1997: National Solid Waste Planning, June 2000]. The results of this survey are to be utilized by the regional solid waste authorities in order to establish an integrated waste treatment site, capable of fulfilling the regional waste management demands.

We have previously reported that rheumatoid arthritis patients, who adopted a modified Cretan Mediterranean diet, obtained a reduction in disease activity and an improvement in physical function and vitality. This shift in diet is likely to result in an altered intake of fatty acids. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to examine the dietary intake of fatty acids, as well as the fatty acid profile in serum phospholipids, during the dietary intervention study presented earlier. From baseline to the end of the study, changes in the reported consumption of various food groups were observed in the Mediterranean diet group. The change in diet resulted in a number of differences between the Mediterranean diet group and the control diet group regarding the fatty acid intake. For instance, a lower ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids was observed in the Mediterranean diet group, both assessed by diet history interviews (dietary intake) and measured in serum phospholipids. Moreover, the patients in the Mediterranean diet group that showed a moderate or better clinical improvement during the study (diet responders), had a higher reported intake of n-3 fatty acids and a lower ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids compared to the patients with minor or no improvement. Also the fatty acid profile in serum phospholipids differed in part between the diet responders and the diet non-responders. The changes in the fatty acid profile, indicated both by dietary assessments and through fatty acids in s-phospholipids may, at least in part, explain the beneficial effects of the Cretan Mediterranean diet that we have presented earlier.
PMID:16219776	Rand DM, Fry A, Sheldahl L	Genetics. 172(1):329-41	2006	Nuclear-mitochondrial epistasis and drosophila aging: introgression of Drosophila simulans mtDNA modifies longevity in D. melanogaster nuclear backgrounds. 	"Under the mitochondrial theory of aging, physiological decline with age results from the accumulated cellular damage produced by reactive oxygen species generated during electron transport in the mitochondrion. A large body of literature has documented age-specific declines in mitochondrial function that are consistent with this theory, but relatively few studies have been able to distinguish cause from consequence in the association between mitochondrial function and aging. Since mitochondrial function is jointly encoded by mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear genes, the mitochondrial genetics of aging should be controlled by variation in (1) mtDNA, (2) nuclear genes, or (3) nuclear-mtDNA interactions. The goal of this study was to assess the relative contributions of these factors in causing variation in Drosophila longevity. We compared strains of flies carrying mtDNAs with varying levels of divergence: two strains from Zimbabwe (&lt;20 bp substitutions between mtDNAs), strains from Crete and the United States (approximately 20-40 bp substitutions between mtDNAs), and introgression strains of Drosophila melanogaster carrying mtDNA from Drosophila simulans in a D. melanogaster Oregon-R chromosomal background (&gt;500 silent and 80 amino acid substitutions between these mtDNAs). Longevity was studied in reciprocal cross genotypes between pairs of these strains to test for cytoplasmic (mtDNA) factors affecting aging. The intrapopulation crosses between Zimbabwe strains show no difference in longevity between mtDNAs; the interpopulation crosses between Crete and the United States show subtle but significant differences in longevity; and the interspecific introgression lines showed very significant differences between mtDNAs. However, the genotypes carrying the D. simulans mtDNA were not consistently short-lived, as might be predicted from the disruption of nuclear-mitochondrial coadaptation. Rather, the interspecific mtDNA strains showed a wide range of variation that flanked the longevities seen between intraspecific mtDNAs, resulting in very significant nuclear x mtDNA epistatic interaction effects. These results suggest that even ""defective"" mtDNA haplotypes could extend longevity in different nuclear allelic backgrounds, which could account for the variable effects attributable to mtDNA haplogroups in human aging."

An interesting finding in the epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is that certain mutations in genes coding for chemokine receptors and their ligands may confer resistance to HIV-1 infection and/or AIDS progression. The mutations most frequently studied are the CCR5-delta32, CCR2-64I and SDF1-3'A. We examined the frequency of the above polymorphisms within the Cretan population, evaluating their contribution to a protective genetic background against HIV infection and progression. Two hundred blood samples were recruited at random among prospective blood donors from Crete. Genotyping was initially performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. CCR2 and SDF-1 PCR-amplified genomic regions were further subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis for genotype determination. The CCR5-delta32 allele frequency among our study group was 3.25%, although no respective homozygous samples were detected. The screening for the CCR2-64I polymorphism yielded 39 heterozygous (19.5%) and 4 homozygous (2%) subjects, revealing a CCR2-64I allele frequency of 11.75%. Among our 200 PCR-RFLP analysed samples, 73 (36.5%) were found heterozygous and 23 (11.5%) homozygous for the SDF1-3'A mutant variant. The allele frequency of the above polymorphism reached 29.75%. The frequency of the CCR5-delta32 allele among our study population seems to be remarkably lower compared to previously reported frequencies in other Caucasian groups. However, the SDF1-3'A allele frequency shows significantly higher distribution profiles within our study group compared to those observed in other Caucasian-European populations. The indicated difference could be attributed to the increased homogeneity of our population, which is well balanced and dispersed over a small geographical area. Since this polymorphism is related with delayed progression from HIV infection to AIDS, it could be used for prognostic genotyping in HIV infected Cretan individuals.

The study of essential oils obtained from Coridothymus capitatus and Satureja thymbra collected from different natural habitat types of 11 NATURA 2000 sites scattered all over Crete has shown that they are characterized either by a high amount of carvacrol (up to 75.7%) or thymol (up to 65.6%) or by a more or less equal amount of the two phenols. The results of a discriminant analysis with predefined groups the natural habitat types wherefrom the plants were collected have shown that the oils of both species collected from the dry dwarf-shrub formations of the lowland have a high carvacrol content whereas those collected from the more mesic timber or highland formations have a high thymol content. Furthermore, the results of this study introduce the use of natural habitat unit as a tool for the assessment of essential oil variation.

"In an area near an arsenic mine in Hunan Province of south China, soils were often found with elevated arsenic levels. A field survey was conducted to determine arsenic accumulation in 8 Cretan brake ferns (Pteris cretica) and 16 Chinese brake ferns (Pteris vittata) growing on these soils. Three factors were evaluated: arsenic concentration in above ground parts (fronds), arsenic bioaccumulation factor (BF; ratio of arsenic in fronds to soil) and arsenic translocation factor (TF; ratio of arsenic in fronds to roots). Arsenic concentrations in the fronds of Chinese brake fern were 3-704 mg kg-1, the BFs were 0.06-7.43 and the TFs were 0.17-3.98, while those in Cretan brake fern were 149-694 mg kg-1, 1.34-6.62 and 1.00-2.61, respectively. Our survey showed that both ferns were capable of arsenic accumulation under field conditions. With most of the arsenic being accumulated in the fronds, these ferns have potential for use in phytoremediation of arsenic contaminated soils."

"Because of a lack of GPs in rural areas of Greece it is mandatory for junior doctors to offer medical service in those areas for a year. The aim of this study is to determine the possibility of replacement of internships with nurses and to suggest the most cost-effective way of covering health needs in remote areas. Regional survey. Patients of primary care offices in two remote areas of Crete, Greece within a year. Comparative analysis of the level of preventive medicine (estimated by questionnaires) and health needs in the two areas. The reasons for visiting medical offices, references rates, percentages of glucose and blood pressure regulation are also studied. Prescription of drugs for chronic diseases and blood pressure counting were the main reasons for office visits (2868/4594). Respiratory track infections (364/4594) follow. Apart from the high percentages of uncontrolled patients with blood pressure (34%) and diabetes mellitus (14%) there is a high percentage of ignorance or wrong opinions concerning preventive medicine, for example only 63% knew the value of a pap test. More than two-thirds of ""medical"" visits in rural areas were for acts that nurses could easily do. The easy access to a junior doctor did not promote preventive medicine. Replacement of junior doctors with properly trained nurses cooperating with GPs responsible for greater regions would be more cost-effective than junior doctors improving health in rural areas. Legislation should change, mainly with regard to repeat prescriptions, in order to reduce house visits."

Erysipelas is a bacterial infection of the dermis and hypodermis, mostly of streptococcal origin. Bullous erysipelas represents a severe form of the disease. To evaluate the clinical and microbiological characteristics and treatment of bullous erysipelas. Patients with a diagnosis of bullous erysipelas who were treated at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, between the years 1996 and 2001 were retrospectively studied. Fourteen patients (11 women, 3 men) with bullous erysipelas were evaluated. The lesions were located on the legs and face in 9 and 4 patients, respectively. The median duration of disease before hospital admission was 4 days. Eight patients had fever at presentation. Local trauma and various lesions were common causes for pathogen entry. The initial empirical antibiotic treatment included intravenous beta-lactams and was modified according to the sensitivities of the isolated strains. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 7 (50%), while S. warneri, Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli grew from the lesions of 3 other patients. Six out of 7 S. aureus strains were methicillin resistant (MRSA) but susceptible to several other non-beta-lactam antibiotics such as quinolones, vancomycin, rifampicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Our findings suggest that S. aureus is frequently involved in and probably contributes in synergy with beta-hemolytic streptococci to the complicated course of bullous erysipelas. The frequency of MRSA isolation suggests that beta-lactam antibiotics may not be sufficient for the treatment of bullous erysipelas anymore, at least in areas with a high incidence of MRSA strains. The role of other classes of antibiotics providing adequate coverage for MRSA has to be evaluated in prospective clinical trials.

The regional variability of sediment bacterial community composition and diversity was studied by comparative analysis of four large 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clone libraries from sediments in different regions of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (Thermaikos Gulf, Cretan Sea, and South lonian Sea). Amplified rDNA restriction analysis of 664 clones from the libraries indicate that the rDNA richness and evenness was high: for example, a near-1:1 relationship among screened clones and number of unique restriction patterns when up to 190 clones were screened for each library. Phylogenetic analysis of 207 bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from the sediment libraries demonstrated that Gamma-, Delta-, and Alphaproteobacteria, Holophaga/Acidobacteria, Planctomycetales, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia were represented in all four libraries. A few clones also grouped with the Betaproteobacteria, Nitrospirae, Spirochaetales, Chlamydiae, Firmicutes, and candidate division OPl 1. The abundance of sequences affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria was higher in libraries from shallow sediments in the Thermaikos Gulf (30 m) and the Cretan Sea (100 m) compared to the deeper South Ionian station (2790 m). Most sequences in the four sediment libraries clustered with uncultured 16S rDNA phylotypes from marine habitats, and many of the closest matches were clones from hydrocarbon seeps, benzene-mineralizing consortia, sulfate reducers, sulk oxidizers, and ammonia oxidizers. LIBSHUFF statistics of 16S rDNA gene sequences from the four libraries revealed major differences, indicating either a very high richness in the sediment bacterial communities or considerable variability in bacterial community composition among regions, or both.
PMID:16338890	Scanlon TF	J Homosex. 49(3-4):63-85	2005	The dispersion of pederasty and the athletic revolution in sixth-century BC Greece. 	"Dorian Crete and Thebes are conventionally seen by ancient sources as the originators of pederasty; modern historians see support for this view in Dorian male-centered militarism and sexual segregation in upbringing. Here athletic culture, including training, nudism, and competition, is argued to be a chief 'trigger' for the emergence of pederasty in Sparta and its relatively rapid spread to other Greek states in the seventh to sixth centuries BC. Athletic nudity, in particular, was not a device to enforce civic egalitarianism, as some have argued, but is a persistently erotic incentive that reinforces hegemonic maleness and advertises the individual's virtuous exercise of restraint. In particular, Sparta is found to be the likely source of generalized athletic nudity combined with open pederasty in the early seventh century BC. Nudism in Greek art is erotically charged and not, as others argue, simply a gender marker in the seventh century. Generalized athletic nudity spread to other Greek states emulating the successful Spartan model by the 'athletic revolution' of the early sixth century. With athletic nudity, open pederasty, again following Sparta, was fostered. "

"Grape farmers are exposed to a variety of agents capable of inducing occupational skin disease. We conducted a study to measure the prevalence of skin symptoms and work-related skin symptoms among grape farmers in the Malevisi region of Crete and to provide data on associated risk factors. One hundred twenty grape farmers and 100 controls participated in the study. The protocol consisted of a questionnaire, skin prick tests for 16 common allergens, and measurement of specific IgE antibodies against 8 allergens. Self-reported itchy rash (OR, 2.31; 95%CI, 1.10-4.84, P&lt;0.05) within the last 12 months, and work-related itchy rash (OR, 4.08; 95%CI, 1.01-20.33, P&lt;0.05) were significantly higher in grape farmers than in controls, after adjusting for age and sex. Sensitization to pollens (OR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.41-12.82, P&lt;0.01) and allergic rhinitis (OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.21-8.28, P&lt;0.05) were found to be significantly associated with self-reported itchy rash in the grape farmers group. Grape farmers reported skin symptoms more frequently than non-exposed controls, and IgE-mediated sensitization to pollens was found to be significantly associated with the reported symptoms. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of specific occupational agents on skin diseases among grape farmers."

"To assess the use of radiofrequency myringotomy in combination with mitomycin C as an alternative myringotomy technique on rabbits. Experimental animal research protocol. University of Crete, School of Medicine, Medical Experimental Education and Research Center. Radiofrequency myringotomies were performed under general anesthesia on both ears of 20 rabbits. Mitomycin C (0.3 mg/ml) pledgets were applied in the right ears (study group) and saline pledgets in the left ears (control group). Animals were monitored using otomicroscopy weekly until myringotomy closure. Kaplan-Meier survival techniques were used to compare myringotomy patency time between the two sides. Radiofrequency myringotomy under general anesthesia on both ears of 20 rabbits. Myringotomy patency time. The mean patency time of the study group was 5.45 weeks (95% confidence interval, 5.185-5.715 weeks). The mean patency rate for the control side was 1.60 weeks (95% confidence interval, 1.38-1.82 weeks). The Breslow (generalized Wilcoxon) test showed the study group to have significantly longer patency of radiofrequency myringotomy than the control group (p&lt;0.0001). The patency period of radiofrequency myringotomy was not long enough to be proposed as an alternative to the insertion of ventilation tubes, although mitomycin C had a significant adjunct effect in prolonging the patency rate of radiofrequency myringotomy on rabbits."

HD families in which late-onset occurs consistently in affected members are rare. The objectives of this work was to study such late-onset HD families encountered on Crete, and to trace their genetic origin. Nine late-onset HD kindreds (61 affected members) were studied along with two typical HD families (17 affected members). We genotyped 33 late-onset Cretan HD chromosomes, 9 Cretan typical HD chromosomes and 114 Cretan control chromosomes using 14 STR markers and 20 SNPs that map to 4p16.3. In contrast to the typical HD pedigrees, the late-onset HD families lacked anticipation and juvenile cases. The expanded CAG repeat (36-42 units) in these families remained either stable or it showed small increment instability, even when transmitted through the father. All late-onset HD chromosomes shared a conserved haplotype defined by the markers D4S95: 1090, D4S127: 157, rs362277: A, rs3025814: G, rs2530596: A that span a 0.277-Mb segment on 4p16.3. Coalescence analysis traced this haplotype to a founder who lived about 1000 years ago. In contrast, each of the two typical HD disease pedigrees derived from a different founder. Sequencing of a 5-kb DNA segment immediately upstream of the HD gene revealed a novel single nucleotide polymorphism at -1757 bp relative to the translation start site, which was more prevalent in Cretan than in North American chromosomes. All late-onset HD families on Crete arose from a common founder with the disease's mutation evolving over the centuries via small-increment instability. These findings suggest that cis-acting factors may be operational.

The polymorphism of four isozymes was studied on single females of Tetranychus urticae from Crete (Greece), using an isoelectric focusing technique. Genetic differentiation was found to be correlated with distance but not with the species of colonized host-plants. Thus no differentiation was observed between samples collected on citrus trees, tomato, pumpkin, okra or weed plants located within a 50 m(2) area, showing that at this geographical scale T. urticae populations are panmictic. In contrast, samples from plants at 150 m or more from one another displayed a significant genetic differentiation. These results are discussed in relation to the known pattern of migration in the species.

In 2001, the newly established Regional Health and Welfare System of Crete commissioned the first needs' assessment study of nursing personnel employed in the public sector of primary health care (PHC). To capture the profile and professional needs of nursing staff working in Health Centers throughout the island of Crete and explore variations in nursing practice by educational preparation. A newly developed, psychometrically tested questionnaire, was administered to all nursing staff in 14 rural Health Centers. Vacancy rates are high, indicating a serious staffing deficit. The type of degree earned (2-year vs. 3 or 4-year program) does not differentiate nursing practice, with only two exceptions (obtaining a patient's history and counselling patients). The majority of respondents assess their existing knowledge and skills as 'adequate' while indicating a strong desire for continuing education. Job satisfaction is high in terms of interactions with clients and community recognition, while it is rated 'low' in terms of daily interactions with colleagues and support from work environment. Cretan nursing staff in PHC operate within a restricted and task-orientated framework. Their educational preparation has little effect in practice role variations and professional needs. The Regional Health and Welfare System of Crete should address daily supervision and support issues, on-the-job training, continuing education needs, while taking immediate action to avoid potential turnover of existing staff and to aggressively recruit young, qualified nursing staff who will choose a career in PHC nursing.

"Onychomycosis represents the most frequently encountered nail disease, which is difficult to eradicate with drug treatment. Epidemiological studies concerning onychomycosis have been performed in many countries worldwide. Differences in the incidence of onychomycosis have been reported not only for various geographical areas, but also for different regions of the same country. This survey was undertaken to determine the epidemiology of onychomycosis in the population of Crete, Greece. In a prospective study, the fingernails and toenails of all new patients presenting to the outpatient Dermatology Department of the University Hospital of Crete were examined by certified dermatologists. If they appeared abnormal, nail material was obtained for mycologic examination. A total of 23,477 patients were examined during the study period (1992-2001). Of them, 19,556 (83.3%) participated in the investigation. Clinical abnormal nails were observed in 2098 (10.7%) patients, 36.7% males and 63.3% females. Mycologically confirmed onychomycosis was detected in 511 (24.3%). Toenail onychomycosis was found in 283 (55.4%) patients, fingernail onychomycosis in 210 (41%), and both toenail and fingernail onychomycosis in 18 (3.6%). In the toenail infections, dermatophytes were most frequently isolated (52%), followed by yeasts (24.7%) and moulds (15.5%); 7.8% of the infections were mixed. In the fingernail infections, yeasts were most often isolated (82.9%), followed by dermatophytes (10%), and moulds (1.9%); 5.2% of the infections were mixed. Because the pattern of onychomycoses in a country is changing with time, epidemiological studies are necessary for determining the prevalence and the causative agents of the infection."

In Greece where primary health care services are not fully developed, patients with simple or minor conditions have to attend to hospitals to be treated. We analysed the data of patients with cutaneous disorders attending the tertiary referral hospital on the Island of Crete, with the aim to identify the most common conditions that patients complain of, in order to define the areas where the education of General Practitioners in Dermatology must focus. All patients attending the Dermatology ambulatory office in the Emergency Department of the University General Hospital of Heraklion from January 2003 to December 2003 were included in this retrospective analysis. The medical records of the patients (history, physical examination and laboratory investigations) were analysed to ascertain the diagnosis and the management of cases. All patients were evaluated by qualified dermatologists. A total of 3715 patients attended the Dermatology Clinic. Most patients were young adults in the age group 21-40 years (38.4%), and the male to female ratio was 1 to 1.2. Allergic skin diseases, mostly dermatitis and urticaria (35.7%) were the most common for attendance, followed by infectious diseases (26.1%) and insect bites (10.2%). Inflammatory and autoimmune disorders accounted for 7.9% of the cases. Pruritus of unknown origin was diagnosed in 6.3% of patients. Skin tumors were detected in 2.7%. The management of the vast majority of cases (85.0%) consisted of advice with or without a prescription, while only 4.8% of patients required admission. Allergic and infectious skin diseases were the most common cutaneous diseases in patients attending this tertiary University hospital, while the management of most patients did not require specialised care. On the basis of the present data, the training of primary health care providers in Dermatology should emphasize these common conditions, with the aim of improving primary care and alleviating the burden on hospital care.

Deliberation of drug prescribing patterns is essential in an effort to improve prescribing standards and quality of care. It is vital for pharmaco-epidemiological research. In this study, data from GPs' practices was used to explore variation in the prescribing patterns in a rural area of Crete. This article reports the findings with respect to the patients' age, sex and diagnoses, and discusses them with the broad aim of identifying areas for practice improvement. One thousand prescriptions, issued during a one-year period, were pre-selected from the area of Anogia Health Centre in Crete, Greece. A copy of each pre-selected prescription was made, and a short pre-tested questionnaire with supplementary information about the prescription was filled. Age, gender, prescription through a third person's intervention, and renewal of an old prescription, were registered on this questionnaire. Drugs were classified according to the International Classification of Primary Care--Drugs, and diagnoses according to the International Classification of Primary Care. The vast majority of prescriptions, namely n = 285 (74.2%) for male and n = 481 (78.1%) for female patients, were prescribed for individuals between the ages of 50 and 89 years. The 10 most commonly recorded diagnoses were found in 54.2% of the studied prescriptions for the male population, although only 47% for the female. Hypertension, respiratory infections, and ischaemic heart disease were, over all, the most commonly recorded diseases. The drugs commonly recorded for both sexes were paracetamol and furosemide, as well as some antibiotics. Analysis of the prescribing data revealed that more than one in every three prescriptions was prescribed through a third-person contact and 69.8% (n = 698) of the prescriptions were renewal of an older one. For more than 51% of the cases, the patients asked only for a prescription. The diagnosis 'oral contraceptive' was absent in the study, while there was a large consumption of antibiotics. The prescribing patterns illustrated in this study present both similarities with and differences from the registered patterns in other studies. The recognition of these patterns is an essential tool for the GPs who are serving rural areas of Crete, and formulation of practical guidelines on the drugs most often prescribed is anticipated to improve the primary care physicians' performance.

Only one study has investigated the relationship of essential fatty acids in the adipose tissue with depression in adults and suggested an inverse relationship between docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3) (DHA) and depression. To examine the relation between adipose tissue polyunsaturated fatty acids especially n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, an index of long-term or habitual fatty acid intake, and depression in adults. Cross-sectional study of healthy adults from the island of Crete. The Preventive Medicine and Nutrition Clinic, University of Crete, Greece. A total of 130 healthy adults (59 males, 71 females) aged 22-58 years. The sample was a sub-sample of the Greek ApoEurope study group. Fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography in adipose tissue. Information about depression was obtained through the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale. Adipose tissue DHA was inversely related with depression. Multiple linear regression analysis taking into account the possible confounding effect of age, gender, body mass index, smoking and educational level confirmed this association. The inverse relationship between adipose DHA and depression in adults, replicates findings of a previous study. This relationship indicates that a low long-term dietary intake of DHA is associated with an increased risk for depression in adults.

"Folate has emerged as a key nutrient for optimising health. Impaired folate status has been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, various types of cancers, and neurocognitive disorders. The study aimed at examining the distribution and determinants of serum folate concentrations in a healthy adult population in Crete, Greece. A cross-sectional sample of 486 healthy adults (250 men, 236 women) aged 39 +/- 14 years, personnel of the Medical School and the University Hospital of Crete in Greece, was examined. Serum folate and vitamin B12 concentrations were measured by microbiological assay, and total homocysteine was determined fluorometrically and by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Lifestyle questionnaires were completed, and nutrient intakes and food consumption were assessed by 24-h dietary recalls. Multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS v10.1. The geometric mean (95% confidence interval) concentrations of serum folate were 15.6 micromol/l (14.6-16.8) in men and 19.2 micromol/l (17.9-20.7) in women (p &lt; 0.001). Inadequate folate levels (&lt;or=7 nmol/l) were present in 6.8% of men and 2.1% of women (p &lt; 0.001). Approximately 76% of men and 87% of women did not meet the reference dietary intake for folate (400 microg/day). Serum folate was inversely related to total homocysteine levels (p &lt; 0.001). Increased tobacco and coffee consumption were associated with lower folate concentrations (p &lt; 0.05 for both) but these associations disappeared after controlling for nutrient intakes. In multivariate analysis, intakes of MUFA, fibre, calcium, magnesium, folate, and vitamins A, E, C, B1, and B6 were positively associated with serum folate. Consumption of potatoes, legumes, fruits, and vegetables were favourably related to the serum folate status. Serum folate concentrations were associated with various demographic, lifestyle and dietary factors in healthy Cretan adults. Large-scale epidemiological studies should be conducted within the general Greek adult population to assess the prevalence of impaired folate status and further examine associations with dietary patterns and chronic disease risk. Considering the importance of folate in health maintenance, it is important to increase the public's awareness of modifiable lifestyle patterns and diet and tobacco use in particular, which may be associated with improved folate status."

"A farm childhood is apparently protective in allergic disease, but studies of this issue in Europe have been confined to particular types of farming practice. This study addressed whether or not this effect was generalisable. A cross-sectional survey of 800 schoolchildren living in rural Crete was undertaken. Standard questions relating to allergic disease were included and atopy was measured through skin-prick tests involving 10 local aeroallergens. The prevalence of atopy was 24%, but associated symptoms were far less common. At all ages, children from farming families had more frequent contact with farm animals (mainly goats), but were no less likely to be atopic. Atopy and seasonal rhinitis were significantly and independently more common among first-born children. This community has an intermediate prevalence of atopy but a very low frequency of allergic disease; farming does not seem to be an important determinant, possibly because it is of the wrong sort. Thus farming effects may be specific to local practices. First-born children in this community also appear to be at increased risk of allergic disease."

"Studies have shown that depression relates to biomarkers of both short- and long-term polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake. However, it is not known which of these two biomarkers has the closest relationship to depression. To examine the relationship of depression with both adipose tissue and serum cholesteryl ester PUFA and to assess the importance of each of these two biomarkers in relating to depression. Cross-sectional study of healthy elderly men from the island of Crete. The Preventive Medicine and Nutrition Clinic, University of Crete, Greece. A total of 150 males, aged 80-96 years. The subjects were survivors of the Greek Seven Countries Study group. Fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography in adipose tissue and serum cholesteryl esters. Information about depression was obtained through the use of the short form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Regression analysis showed that depression related positively to age and serum cholesteryl ester arachidonic/docosahexaenoic fatty acid ratio. The only significant unadjusted correlation between depression and serum cholesteryl ester and adipose fatty acids was with adipose alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (r = -0.31, P &lt; 0.01). Depressed males (GDS-15 &gt; 5) had lower adipose ALA and sum n-3 fatty acids than non-depressed ones. There were no significant differences between depressed and non-depressed males in serum cholesteryl ester fatty acids. When adipose tissue ALA was included as one of the independent measures in the regression model, the observed positive relation between GDS-15 depression and cholesteryl ester arachidonic/docosahexaenoic ratio failed to persist. Instead, there was a negative relationship between GDS-15 depression and adipose tissue ALA. It appears that the fatty acids of the adipose tissue are better predictors of depression than those of serum cholesteryl esters. This indicates that depression relates more strongly to long-term than to short-term fatty acid intake. The reason for this may be the reported slow rate of deposition of dietary PUFA to the brain."

The aim of the present study was to determine the serotype distribution and the evolution of antimicrobial resistance among Salmonella enterica strains isolated from patients with diarrhea in Crete, Greece, during a 5-year period (2000-2004). Among the 401 S. enterica isolates recovered, serotype Enteritidis was the most prevalent (66.6%), followed by serotype Typhimurium (14.2%). The rates of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nalidixic acid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were 8.5, 7, 0.7, 5.4, 14.2, 2.7 and 2.7%, respectively. A marked decrease in resistance was observed during the study period. Resistance and multidrug resistance was most common in serotype Typhimurium. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production observed in one strain of S. enterica serotype Virchow and the reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility detected in 2.7% of the isolates studied are causes of concern.

To evaluate clinical and audiologic data as well as operative findings and postoperative follow-up in the management of chronic cholesteatomatous otitis media with canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM). A retrospective review of cases followed up between 1990 and 2002. Tertiary referral centre. Two hundred one patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma underwent CWDM. Clinical presentation, surgical findings, and audiologic evaluation were assessed. Preoperatively, eight patients suffered from vertigo and four presented with facial nerve paralysis. In 40 patients (20%), erosion of the lateral semicircular canal was found, and in 31 patients (15%), there was dehiscence of the facial nerve canal. Dural plate erosion and sinus plate dehiscence were found in 13 and 17 patients, respectively. Nine patients experienced serious endocranial complications at their admission. The malleus was noted to be intact in the majority of patients in all age groups. The incus was eroded or absent in most of the cases in all age groups. On postoperative evaluation 3 months after surgery, 195 audiograms were performed, with a mean pure-tone average of 55 dB HL and a mean air-bone gap of 30 dB HL. Although CWDM has the disadvantages of the necessity to avoid water insertion in the external auditory canal and lifelong mastoid care, it is an effective treatment in a single-step procedure for patients with advanced disease and for those who refuse to submit to postoperative follow-up.

"Dietary habits are an important determinant of serum homocysteine (tHcy), which may be a marker rather than a cause of progression of the atherosclerotic process. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the nutritional status, and to determine the serum tHcy concentrations in healthy subjects who live in rural areas of Crete, and who theoretically follow a contemporary Mediterranean-style diet. Serum tHcy, folate, vitamin B(12), creatinine, glucose, and the lipid profile, were measured in 203 (141 men and 62 women) healthy subjects, aged 33-78 years. The major risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as age, gender, cigarette smoking, obesity were recorded and dietary data were assessed using a 3-day weighed food intake record. Our population had high serum tHcy, low serum folate concentrations and lower than the traditional Cretan dietary folate intake [median (range): 12.0 (3.6-44.7) micromol L(-1), 7.9 (1.9-15.5) ng mL(-1) and 241 (68-1106) microg, respectively]. Dietary intake of fibre, omega-3, and mono- or/ polyunsaturated fatty acids was also low. An inverse relation was observed between serum tHcy concentrations and serum folate (r = -0.28; P &lt; 0.01) and vitamin B(12) levels (r = -0.33; P &lt; 0.001). Nowadays, the Cretan diet has changed towards a more westernized eating pattern. Given the analytic difficulties in determining the amount of folate in food and the inverse correlation between serum tHcy and folate levels, serum tHcy concentrations may be a useful marker for nutritional status, especially folate deficiency, in healthy subjects."

"During the years 2003-2005, a comparative ethnobotanical field survey was conducted on remedies used in traditional animal healthcare in eight Mediterranean areas. The study sites were selected within the EU-funded RUBIA project, and were as follows: the upper Kelmend Province of Albania; the Capannori area in Eastern Tuscany and the Bagnocavallo area of Romagna, Italy; Cercle de Ouezanne, Morocco; Sierra de Aracena y Picos de Aroche Natural Park in the province of Huelva, Spain; the St. Catherine area of the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt; Eastern and Western Crete, Greece; the Paphos and Larnaca areas of Cyprus; and the Mitidja area of Algeria.One hundred and thirty-six veterinary preparations and 110 plant taxa were recorded in the survey, with Asteraceae and Lamiaceae being the most quoted botanical families. For certain plant species the survey uncovered veterinary phytotherapeutical indications that were very uncommon, and to our knowledge never recorded before. These include Anabasis articulata (Chenopodiaceae), Cardopatium corymbosum (Asteraceae), Lilium martagon (Liliaceae), Dorycnium rectum (Fabaceae), Oenanthe pimpinelloides (Apiaceae), Origanum floribundum (Lamiaceae), Tuberaria lignosa (Cistaceae), and Dittrichia graveolens (Asteraceae). These phytotherapeutical indications are briefly discussed in this report, taking into account modern phytopharmacology and phytochemistry.The percentage of overall botanical veterinary taxa recorded in all the study areas was extremely low (8%), however when all taxa belonging to the same botanical genus are considered, this portion increases to 17%. Nevertheless, very few plant uses were found to be part of a presumed ""Mediterranean"" cultural heritage in veterinary practices, which raises critical questions about the concept of Mediterraneanism in ethnobotany and suggests that further discussion is required.Nearly the half of the recorded veterinary plant uses for mammals uncovered in this survey have also been recorded in the same areas in human folk medicine, suggesting a strong link between human and veterinary medical practices, and perhaps also suggesting the adaptive origins of a few medical practices. Since most of the recorded data concern remedies for treating cattle, sheep, goats, and camels, it would be interesting to test a few of the recorded phytotherapeuticals in the future, to see if they are indeed able to improve animal healthcare in breeding environments, or to raise the quality of dairy and meat products in the absence of classical, industrial, veterinary pharmaceuticals."

"To investigate the extraintestinal manifestations of non-typhoidal Salmonellae (NTS) infection in immunocompetent infants and children. The study took place at the University General Hospital at Heraklion, Crete. Over a 10-year period from 1993-2002 we studied 1087 patients, of whom 443 were children less than 14 years old, with a culture-proven diagnosis of NTS infection. Stool and blood cultures were routinely obtained in patients presenting with fever and diarrhea. The cases of invasive infection in otherwise well children, including bacteremia and/or extraintestinal focal infections were further analyzed. Invasive cases were less common in children than adults (4.06% vs. 8.7%; relative risk 0.467; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.279-0.784; p=0.0033). Furthermore, invasive cases were much less common in the otherwise well than in immunocompromised children (3.5% vs. 21.4%; relative risk 0.163; 95% CI 0.053-0.500; p=0.0008). The 15 otherwise well children with invasive NTS infection were aged from 3 weeks to 7.5 years, and nine were aged less than 12 months. Among them, 11 presented with bacteremia, and four with focal extraintestinal infections (rectal abscess, deep neck abscess, urinary tract infection, elbow arthritis). Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars Enteritidis and Virchow were the most common invasive serotypes. All invasive strains were susceptible to beta-lactams including ampicillin, and to cotrimoxazole. All patients made a complete recovery with intravenous antibiotics and did not present with relapses or major infections during long-term follow-up. Invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis in immunocompetent children is less frequent than in both immunocompromised children and in adulthood. However, invasive cases may well occur in otherwise healthy children, especially during infancy. In these patients, prompt appropriate treatment leads to favorable outcomes."

"Persons with Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are seriously affected in their everyday life. The effect across different cultural settings of IBS on their quality of life has been little studied. The aim was to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of individuals suffering from IBS in two different cultural settings; Crete, Greece and Linköping, Sweden. This study is a sex and age-matched case-control study, with n = 30 Cretan IBS cases and n = 90 Swedish IBS cases and a Swedish control group (n = 300) randomly selected from the general population. Health-related quality of life, measured by SF-36 and demographics, life style indicators and co-morbidity, was measured. Cretan IBS cases reported lower HRQOL on most dimensions of SF-36 in comparison to the Swedish IBS cases. Significant differences were found for the dimensions mental health (p &lt; 0.0001) and general health (p = 0.05) even after adjustments for educational level and co-morbidity. Women from Crete with IBS scored especially low on the dimensions general health (p = 0.009) and mental health (p &lt; 0.0001) in comparison with Swedish women with IBS. The IBS cases, from both sites, reported significantly lower scores on all HRQOL dimensions in comparison with the Swedish control group. The results from this study tentatively support that the claim that similar individuals having the same disease, e.g. IBS, but living in different cultural environments could perceive their disease differently and that the disease might affect their everyday life and quality of life in a different way. The Cretan population, and especially women, are more seriously affected mentally by their disease than Swedish IBS cases. Coping with IBS in everyday life might be more problematic in the Cretan environment than in the Swedish setting."

"The prevalence of childhood obesity has been rising during the past decades in many parts of the world, including Greece. The dispersion of these trends across age, however, is less clear. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between age and 20-year changes in anthropometric characteristics of Greek boys. A total of 204 and 106 boys 9 years old, 163 and 274 boys 12 years old, and 161 and 240 boys 15 years old were randomly recruited in 1982 and 2002, respectively, throughout the county of Iraklio, Crete, Greece. Height, weight, and BMI were measured. Contemporary 9 and 12 year olds were taller than their peers in 1982 (+2.9% and +1.2%, respectively; p &lt; 0.005), but this was not the case for 15 year olds (-0.8%; p = 0.083). Body weight and BMI were higher now than in the 1980s, and this held true for all age groups (p &lt; 0.001). Increases in weight also showed a decline with advancing age (+17.4%, +13.9%, and +4.0% for 9, 12, and 15 year olds, respectively), whereas BMI changes were similar for those 9 and 12 years of age (approximately 10.5%), but were almost 2-fold higher than in 15 year olds (+5.5%). Contemporary boys are taller, heavier, and have higher BMI values than their peers in 1982, but the magnitude of these increases gradually declines with advancing age. Rates of increase in BMI, however, seem to have greatly accelerated compared with previous decades."

"The current study is a 4-year follow-up after the 6-year-long health and nutrition intervention programme applied in the primary schools of Crete. The aim of the current work was to identify whether the benefits obtained in certain health indices at the end of the intervention period were also present 4 years later. From a representative population of 441 pupils (250 from the intervention schools and 191 from the control schools), biochemical, dietary and physical activity data were obtained at baseline, at the end of the intervention period and after intervention (academic years 1992- 1993, 1997-1998 and 2001-2002, respectively). The findings of the current study revealed that the favourable changes in serum lipids observed at the end of the intervention period were maintained from baseline to after intervention for total cholesterol (-24-3 (SE 1.65) v. -9.70 (SE 2.03) mg/dl; P = 0-001), LDL-cholesterol(-18.6 (SE 1-41) v. -2.49 (SE 1.75) mg/dl; P &lt; 0-001), HDL-cholesterol (-8-34 (SE 0.75) v. -9-60 (SE 1-10) mg/dl; P = 0-014) and total cholesterol :HDL-cholesterol ratio (0.31 (SE 0.06) v. 0.04 (SE 0.05); P = 0001). Similar favourable changes for the intervention group were observed in leisure-time physical activities (38.3 (SE 11-7) v. -13.2 (SE 10.9) min/week; P = 0.038) and BMI (6-05 (SE 0.18) v. 6.67 (SE 0-21) kg/m(2);P = 0.014), whereas no changes were observed in the fitness and dietary indices examined. The findings of the current study are encouraging, indicating maintenance of the favourable changes observed in serum lipids, BMI and physical activity 4 years after the programme had ended."

The badger, Meles meles, is a widely distributed mustelid in Eurasia and shows large geographic variability in morphological characters whose evolutionary significance is unclear and needs to be contrasted with molecular data. We sequenced 512 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region in 115 Eurasian badgers from 21 countries in order to test for the existence of structuring in their phylogeography, to describe the genetic relationships among their populations across its widespread geographic range, and to infer demographic and biogeographic processes. We found that the Eurasian badger is divided into four groups regarding their mitochondrial DNA: Europe, Southwest Asia, North and East Asia, and Japan. This result suggests that the separation of badgers into phylogeographic groups was influenced by cold Pleistocene glacial stages and permafrost boundaries in Eurasia, and by geographic barriers, such as mountains and deserts. Genetic variation within phylogeographic groups based on distances assuming the Tamura-Nei model with rate heterogeneity and invariable sites (d(T-N) range: 3.3-4.2) was much lower than among them (d(T-N) range: 10.7-38.0), and 80% of the variation could be attributed to differences among regions. Spatial analysis of molecular variance (samova), median-joining network, and Mantel test did not detect genetic structuring within any of the phylogeographic groups with the exception of Europe, where 50% of variation was explained by differences among groups of populations. Our data suggest that the European, Southwest Asian, and North and East Asian badgers evolved separately since the end of Pliocene, at the beginnings of glacial ages, whereas Japanese badgers separated from continental Asian badgers during the middle Pleistocene. Endangered badgers from Crete Island, classified as Meles meles arcalus subspecies, were closely related to badgers from Southwest Asia. We also detected sudden demographic growth in European and Southwest Asian badgers that occurred during the Middle Pleistocene.
PMID:16615218	Duron O, Fort P, Weill M	Proc Biol Sci. 273(1585):495-502	2006	Hypervariable prophage WO sequences describe an unexpected high number of Wolbachia variants in the mosquito Culex pipiens. 	Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria that infect many arthropod species and may induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) resulting in abortive embryonic development. Among all the described host species, mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens complex display the highest variability of CI crossing types. Paradoxically, searches for polymorphism in Wolbachia infecting strains and field populations hitherto failed or produced very few markers. Here, we show that an abundant source of the long-sought polymorphism lies in WO prophage sequences present in multiple copies dispersed in the genome of Wolbachia infecting C. pipiens (wPip). We identified up to 66 different Wolbachia variants in C. pipiens strains and field populations and no occurrence of superinfection was observed. At least 49 different Wolbachia occurred in Southern Europe C. pipiens populations, and up to 10 different Wolbachia were even detected in a single population. This is in sharp contrast with North African and Cretan samples, which exhibited only six variants. The WO polymorphism appeared stable over time, and was exclusively transferred maternally. Interestingly, we found that the CI pattern previously described correlates with the variability of Gp15, a prophage protein similar to a bacterial virulence protein. WO prophage sequences thus represent variable markers that now open routes for approaching the molecular basis of CI, the host effects, the structure and dynamics of Wolbachia populations.

For Greece, no data regarding the incidence of cutaneous melanoma (CM) have been reported. In this report, we present epidemiologic data for CM on Crete, an island in southern Greece, during the years 1999-2002. We attempt a comparison with corresponding data reported for the Italian population. One hundred and two CM patients of Cretan origin with primary CM first diagnosed between the years 1999-2002 were interviewed and underwent complete skin examination by the same two experienced dermatologists. Crude and/or age-standardized incidence rates were calculated for Crete as a whole, as well as for each one of the four prefectures of the island. The age-standardized incidence rate according to the Greek population was 4.6 per 100,000 person-years for men and 4.7 per 100,000 person-years for women. The crude incidence rates did not differ significantly between the four prefectures. Significant differences between Cretan and Italian CM patients were found in terms of gender, age at diagnosis, anatomic site and histogenetic type of CM, hair color, skin reaction to sun exposure, history of sunburn before the age of 15 years, presence of solar lentigines, and total common nevus count. The incidence of CM on Crete is higher than that estimated for the whole of Greece and comparable with the incidence reported for other southern European countries.

Comparative analysis of the incidence rates and epidemiological features of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) between different ethnic groups exposed to varying environmental factors is critical for consideration of the causes of CMM but can also be utilized in a public health approach to control of the disease. To compare incidence rates and clinical features of CMM in a Greek and a central European population (central Baden-Württemberg, Germany). Incident cases of CMM were traced in all hospitals of the island of Crete for the period 1999-2002. Age-standardized incidence rates per 100 000 inhabitants per year for the European Standard Population were calculated based on the Cretan population statistics. A comparison was performed between the Cretan findings and those of southern Germany as registered by the hospital-based Central Malignant Melanoma Registry, which likewise documents more clinical features than normally recorded by population-based cancer registries. Mean incidence rates in Crete for 1999-2002 were 4.01 per 100 000 inhabitants per year for males and 4.05 for females as compared with 10.6 for males and 11.1 for females in southern Germany. There were striking differences in the clinical characteristics of CMMs, with significantly higher tumour thickness in Crete (median 1.4 mm vs. 0.7 mm in southern Germany). Correspondingly, significantly more nodular melanomas were observed in Crete (29%) as compared with southern Germany (11%). Incidence of CMM in Crete, with about four cases per 100 000 inhabitants per year, is clearly higher than previously estimated, and there is an urgent necessity for earlier recognition of CMM in Crete. However, the incidence of CMM in southern Germany is much higher.

"The aim of this paper was to evaluate the use of different bulking agents in different ratios as a means to control, optimise and eventually reduce the duration of the thermophilic period in two-phase olive oil mill sludge (OOMS) composting. The bulking agents used were: (i) olive tree leaves (OTL), (ii) olive tree shredded branches (OTB) and (iii) woodchips (WDC). The selection of these materials was based on their abundance and availability on the island of Crete, the southernmost point of Greece. The ratios studied were: Pile 1, OOMS:OTL in 1:1 v/v; Pile 2, OOMS:WDC in 1:1.5 v/v; Pile 3, OOMS:OTL in 1:2 v/v; Pile 4, OOMS:OTL:OTB in 1:1:1 v/v; and Pile 5, OOMS:OTL:OTB in 1:1:2 v/v. The composting system used was that of windrows with the volume of each pile approximately 20-25 m3. The experiments took place over two consecutive years. A composting turner was used and turnings were performed at one and two week intervals. In each pile a variety of physiochemical parameters were monitored. Temperature remained high in all five trials. Piles 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 temperatures recorded values of above 50 degrees C for 106, 158, 160, 175 and 183 days, respectively. Volumes were reduced by approximately 67%, 62%, 63%, 80% and 84%, respectively. Temperature remained high, mainly due to the presence in large amounts of oily substances which during their complete oxidation release important amounts of energy and aid the cometabolism of more stable molecules such as lignin. This process is better described as the slow ""burning"" of a ""fuel"" mixture in an ""engine"" than composting. This approach is based on the extensive similarities of this process to that of crude oil sludge or similar waste composting."

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal, recessively inherited disease, characterized by recurrent fever and serositis that affects mainly patients of the Mediterranean basin. The gene responsible for FMF, named MEFV, was cloned and several missense mutations were found to be responsible for the disease. Based on a recent molecular analysis of MEFV gene mutations in 43 patients from Crete aiming to correlate specific genotypes and clinical manifestations of FMF, we were prompted to construct a three-dimensional model (3-D model) of the PRYSPRY domain of pyrin. The majority of the known MEFV mutations located on this domain have been classified, according to disease severity, and localized on this 3-D model. The functional consequences of these mutations and their implications on disease severity are discussed. Moreover, we report a putative novel missense mutation, S702C, which we identified in exon 10 of the MEFV gene and localized on the constructed 3-D model.

Marine sediments from the Mar Grande and Gulf of Taranto were analysed for 17 parent PAHs, with molecular weight from 128 to 278 Daltons. The analyses were performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Total PAHs content in sediments ranged from 464 to 12522 microg kg(-1) dry wt for Mar Grande and from 593 to 72275 microg kg(-1) dry wt for Gulf of Taranto. The analytical results were compared with the published results for other coastal areas in the Mediterranean Sea. PAHs levels in the Gulf of Taranto sediments were the highest in the Mediterranean sea, while PAHs concentrations in Mar Grande were higher than the ones reported in the Adriatic and Cretan Sea and with the same order of magnitude of the ones known for coastal areas of the Western and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. PAHs concentration ratios were consistent with the main source of these compounds, in most areas, being pyrolysis. Based on the comparison of both the individual and the total PAHs concentrations with proposed sediment quality guidelines, the acute biological effects on the marine organisms were probable, especially for the Gulf of Taranto, in which almost all PAHs concentrations in sediments were higher than the guidelines limit values. The statistical analysis effected by HCA and PCA methods was used in order to classify sediment samples and to identify accumulation areas.

"To explore the prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 7-y-old child residents of Crete, Greece. The study combined information from both parents and teachers for 1708 elementary school children attending the first grade in 101 classes of 55 primary schools. A two-stage screening process was employed, including the ADHD test and a rating scale of student behaviour. Parents completed the ADHD test and teachers the rating scale of student behaviour. Both questionnaires were completed for 1285 (75.2%) children. Among them, 84 children (6.5%; 95% CI 5.2-7.9%) met the study criteria for ADHD. The estimated prevalence was 8.8% for boys (95% CI 6.6-11.0%) and 4.2% for girls (95% CI 2.6-5.7%). No significant differences were observed regarding urban, semi-urban or rural residence. By using a combination screening procedure, both the ADHD prevalence among first-grade schoolchildren in Crete and the gender differences in prevalence were found to be comparable to those reported from other countries. The methods used and the problems faced illustrate the challenges involved in conducting population-based studies of ADHD."

In Greece, primary care is still developing. The aim of this study was to define the epidemiologic profile of common otorhinolaryngological, head and neck disorders in order to help general practitioners to deal with them in a primary care future. A total of 6771 patients attended the Otorhinolaryngology emergency department of the University General Hospital of Heraklion (Crete), between January and December 2004. All cases were included in this retrospective study. The registry of the Otorhinolaryngology emergency department was analysed and age, sex, seasonality and clinical diagnosis were tabulated. All patients were evaluated by Otorhinolaryngologists. The classification of the cases was based on the main symptom or clinical sign that conditioned the reason for seeking care. Diagnoses were also coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The male to female ratio was 1:1. The mean age for females was 36.3 years standard deviation (SD): 21.1 and for males was 36.8 years (SD = 22.0). Eight hundred eighty six patients (13.1%) formed the paediatric sub-group. Over 60% of the cases were classified in ten major groups of diagnosis. Acute tonsillitis (12.3%) and acute pharyngitis (9.0%) were the most common causes of all medical visits, followed by otitis media (7.6%) and external ear canal obstruction by ear wax (6.2%). Oedema of the larynx was detected in 0.4%. A negative diagnosis of otorhinolaryngological, head and neck disorder was formulated in 553 patients (8.2%). Hospitalization rate was 5.2%. The highest rate of visits was registered in March. Most patients used the facility as a primary care service. Real emergencies were a minority. Recovering data about which areas of Otorhinolaryngology deserve more emphasis might help primary health care providers to diagnose and manage the common otorhinolaryngological, head and neck disorders properly.

"To evaluate the safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability of conductive keratoplasty (CK) for the treatment of hyperopic astigmatism. University of Crete Medical School, Vardinoyannion Eye Institute of Crete, Heraklion, Greece. In this prospective nonrandomized noncontrolled single-center study, 47 eyes of 34 patients (15 women and 19 men) were treated for hyperopic astigmatism (up to + 3.50 diopters [D]) with a Refractec ViewPoint CK system and followed for 24 months +/- 0.6 (SD). The treatment consisted of 4 to 36 spots applied to the periphery of the cornea. Mean age was 48.5 years +/- 9.7 years, range 25 to 68 years. All the treated eyes were analyzed for safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability. The mean patient age was 48.5 +/- 9.7 years (range 25 to 68 years). Preoperatively, the mean manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) was +2.11 +/- 0.88 D (range -0.50 to + 4.13 D); at 12 months, it was -0.52 +/- 0.73 D and at 24 months, -0.50 +/- 0.77 D. At 24 months, the mean MRSE was within +/-0.50 D in 61% of eyes, within +/-1.00 D in 83%, and within +/-2.00 D in all eyes. At 24 months, the uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 or better in 37% of eyes and 20/40 or better in 97%. By the end of the follow-up period, no eye had lost &gt; or =2 Snellen lines or had an induced cylinder &gt; or =1.50 D. Conductive keratoplasty for low hyperopic astigmatism was a safe, effective, and stable procedure. Nomogram adjustments and careful patient selection should contribute to higher levels of predictability when treating hyperopic astigmatism."

"Sarcoidosis is thought to be a T-helper type 1 cytokine-mediated disorder. Sputum induction has been proposed as a useful noninvasive method mainly for the assessment of airway diseases. However, it is unknown whether the balance of T-cytotoxic (Tc1) type 1 and Tc2 cells is altered in sarcoidosis. The primary aim of this study was to characterize the CD8+ T lymphocyte subpopulations in induced sputum from sarcoidosis patients, and to compare these subpopulations to those found in BAL fluid (BALF) from sarcoidosis patients. To further investigate the mechanism of the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ lymphocytes, we measured their perforin expression. Additionally, two adhesion molecules (CD62 and CD71), which are expressed on CD8+ T cells and may serve as novel immunologic markers, were detected. Department of Thoracic Medicine, University of Crete, and Department of Pneumonology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece. We prospectively studied 22 patients with sarcoidosis (median age, 48 years; age range, 25 to 65 years) and 10 healthy subjects (5 female and 5 male; median age, 39 years; age range, 26 to 60 years). The stimulation of lymphocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was followed by the use of double immunocytochemical methods to identify CD8+ interferon (IFN)-gamma producing cells (ie, Tc1) and CD8+ interleukin-4 producing cells (ie, Tc2). We found a significant decrease in the prestimulation percentage of IFN-gamma-positive CD8+ T cells in the BALF (p = 0.001) and induced sputum (p = 0.001) of sarcoidosis patients compared to the number in samples from healthy control subjects. However, no significant difference was documented between lymphocyte subsets poststimulation. Decreased levels of perforin expression were found in BALF (p = 0.001) and induced sputum (p &lt; 0.001) of sarcoidosis patients compared to those in control subjects. The adhesion molecules were significantly increased in both the BALF and induced sputum of the sarcoid population compared to those in healthy control subjects. Our results suggest that inflammation could be effectively and noninvasively determined by using sputum induction in sarcoidosis patients. In addition, we have provided evidence suggesting the possibility that CD8+ lymphocytes might not play a major role in sarcoidosis."
PMID:16873712	Spence JD	Stroke. 37(9):2430-5	2006	Nutrition and stroke prevention. 	"Nutrition is much more important in prevention of stroke than is appreciated by most physicians. The powerful effects of statin drugs in lowering the levels of fasting cholesterol, combined with an unbalanced focus on fasting lipids (as opposed to postprandial fat and oxidative stress), have led many physicians and patients to believe that diet is relatively unimportant. Because the statins can lower fasting lipids by &amp;50% to 60%, and a low-fat diet only lowers fasting cholesterol by &amp;5% to 10%, this error is perhaps understandable. However, a Cretan Mediterranean diet, which is high in beneficial oils, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and low in cholesterol and animal fat, has been shown to reduce stroke and myocardial infarction by 60% in 4 years compared with the American Heart Association diet. This effect is twice that of simvastatin in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study: a reduction of myocardial infarction by 40% in 6 years. Vitamins for lowering of homocysteine may yet be shown to be beneficial for reduction of stroke; a key issue is the high prevalence of unrecognized deficiency of vitamin B(12), requiring higher doses of vitamin B(12) than have been used in clinical trials to date. Efforts to duplicate with supplementation the evidence of benefit for vitamins E, C, and beta carotene have been largely fruitless. This may be related to the broad combination of antioxidants included in a healthy diet. A Cretan Mediterranean diet is probably more effective because it provides a wide range of antioxidants from fruits and vegetables of all colors."

"Greece has the highest adult smoking prevalence in the European Union, affecting not only those who smoke but also threatening the health of those who are involuntarily exposed to passive smoke, especially young Greek children. The aim of this study was to quantify passive smoking biomarkers (serum nicotine and cotinine levels) among preschool children in Crete in relation to parental smoking habits. All children enrolled in kindergarten in western Crete (1,757 preschool children and 2,809 parents) were interviewed during the 2004-2005 Cretan health promotion programme out of which a sample of 81 children was randomly selected according to parental smoking status and blood samples for cotinine and nicotine assay were taken. The geometric means of serum nicotine values in children with both parents current smokers and in those with both parents non-smokers were 0.71 ng/ml (95%CI 0.62, 0.80) and 0.59 ng/ml (95%CI 0.49, 0.69), respectively, (p=0.073). Cotinine geometric mean values were found at 1.69 ng/ml (95%CI 0.93, 3.06) and 0.15 ng/ml (95%CI 0.09, 0.28), respectively, (p&lt;0.001). Girls with smoker parents had also greater cotinine geometric mean values than boys (3.35 versus 0.85 ng/ml, respectively, p=0.018). Our findings prove that Greek preschool children, especially young girls, are exposed to substantial levels of passive smoke which therefore stresses the need for immediate action so as to prevent the predisposition and early addiction of Greek preschool children to tobacco."

The current study indicates a favorable effect of the intervention on boys' physical activity levels, which was maintained 4 years after the end of the program."

Food use is changing very fast all over the world. This and other changes (e.g. reduced physical activity, increased longevity) result in novel health risks for the populations in European countries and beyond. Also, in recent decades the convenience food market has grown dramatically and offers novel opportunities for small and large industries alike. Simultaneously, there is a dramatic and irrevocable loss of the local knowledge which forms the basis of many cultural traditions (traditional food knowledge--TFK). The Mediterranean region is well known for a dietary tradition commonly called 'Mediterranean diet(s)', which is renowned for health benefits based among others on widely consumed foods and beverages. While the focus of research has mostly been on the more widely used elements of the Mediterranean diets (especially olive oil and red wine), in this review the focus is on 'local food'. These are ingredients, which are gathered, grown or produced locally and prepared into dishes, which often represent local specialities. Such food is derived from animals, fungi and plants, but in this paper the main subject is food of botanical origin. Particularly important among these local foods are vegetables and salads derived from wild greens (gathered food plants--GFPs) and local cultivars of fruit trees and shrubs. In this review we discuss the theoretical basis (including the concept of traditional knowledge systems) and general approach of an EU-funded multidisciplinary ethnobotanicalpharmacological project focusing on the use of such local resources in several regions of the Mediterranean including the ethnobotanical documentation of food products of selected communities in southern Italy, Spain, Greece (mostly Crete), the identification of extracts/pure compounds (leads for new health food supplements) with potent activity on a series of in vitro targets, especially ones relevant to assess for antioxidant activity, the more detailed in vivo study of some lead extracts and lastly the dissemination of such TFK in local/national languages.

"The diversity of local Mediterranean food elements is not known in detail, but offers itself to search for new vegetables, salads, fruits and spices which could be used in to enrich diets outside their region of origin. Most amid those interesting local elements are edible wild plants and weeds. Ethnobotanical research has identified ca. 2,300 different plant and fungi taxa, which are gathered and consumed in the Mediterranean. Among these, &gt;1,000 are only consumed in one single zone, therefore are strictly local. The percentage of local gathered food plant (GFP) taxa (present in &lt;5 samples), is higher in the main centers of diversity at the periphery of the Mediterranean (Sahara, Alps, Caucasus, Canary Islands, the Levant). Islands (Sicily, Sardinia, Crete, Cyprus) also show a high proportion. Endemism of GFP taxa only accounts for a limited number of these 'ethnobotanical endemics' (only ca. 350 are endemic/ endangered species). On the other hand, only a few taxa--30 occurring in &gt;20 samples--are consumed in most of the Mediterranean. Most have been analyzed in the Local Food- Nutraceuticals project. The ca. 800 GFP taxa that occur in more than the 5% of localities show a geographical pattern that permits one to recognize seven geographical groups. These groups show relationships with types of Mediterranean diet and could also be related with human genetic polymorphism through long-term co-evolution in a geographical mosaic pattern."

In the middle of the previous century the Seven Countries Study first revealed the health benefits of the traditional Cretan diet. The Cretan diet was subsequently used as a basis to form the worldwide known 'Mediterranean diet'. This dietary scheme was visualized as a food pyramid, aimed to constitute a nutrition education tool and guide for the general public and scientific community. However, the way this dietary guide has been perceived by both the public and in certain cases by the scientific community may be oversimplified. From the nutritional point of view, some of the neglected parts of this diet concern the role of locally consumed wild greens, herbs, walnuts, figs and snails, all sources of n-3 fatty acids. The above foods with the addition of fish provide a n-6:n-3 ratio of 2:1 whereas in Northern Europe and the USA the same ratio is 10-20:1. Moreover, the flavonoid and antioxidant content of the traditional Cretan diet may have been underestimated. Despite the increasing knowledge on the bioprotective profile of the traditional Cretan diet, there is a need to revisit the way this knowledge is transferred to the public emphasizing the importance of some neglected food items and nutrients.

Myringotomy patency time. The mean patency times of the saline-treated ears were: 1.85 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.556-2.144 wk) for the LAT group and 1.70 weeks (95% CI, 1.494-1.906 wk) for the RFM group. This difference was not significant (p &gt; 0.5). MC application significantly prolonged mean patency time (p &lt; 0.0001) in both LAT and RFM groups. The mean patency times in the MC-treated ears were 5.45 weeks (95% CI, 5.226-5.674 wk) for the LAT group and 5.55 weeks (95% CI, 5.285-5.815 wk) for the RFM group. This difference was not significant (p &gt; 0.5). There is no significant difference in myringotomy patency times between LAT and RFM techniques in rabbits, whereas MC significantly prolongs the patency rate of either technique."

To calculate the costs of blood collection, testing, storage, and transfusion in Greece. Costing information was collected from two large public hospitals, in Athens and Crete, that also act as blood banks. Given that private health care accounts for 40 percent of total health spending, the same costs were also considered in a private setting by collecting key reagent cost data from a leading private hospital in Athens. Mainly direct costs were considered (advertising campaigns, personnel, storage and maintenance, reagent costs, transportation costs from blood bank to end-use hospitals, and cross-matching and transfusion costs in receiving hospitals) and some indirect costs (opportunity cost of blood donorship). Captive donorship accounts for over 50 percent of the national blood supply. A unit of blood transfused would cost between Euro 294.83 and Euro 339.83 in public hospitals and could reach Euro 413.93 in a private facility. This figure may be an underestimate, as it excludes opportunity costs of blood transfusion for patients and the healthcare system. Blood has a significant cost to the health system. Policy makers and practitioners should encourage its rational use, build on current policies to further improve collection and distribution, encourage further volunteer donorship in Greece, and also consider alternatives to blood where the possibility exists.

This study included all 18 cases of children hospitalized for encephalitis in the referral university hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, during the 5-year period from 2000 to 2004. Encephalitis was attributed to viral infection (echovirus, herpes simplex virus 1, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and influenza A) in eight children and to bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Rickettsia typhi) in a further five cases. Multiple hyperintense brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were associated with a severe clinical presentation but not with a guarded long-term outcome. Five children still presented with mild to moderate sequelae after 1.5 to 5.3 (median 4.0) years. Our findings confirm the elimination of measles, mumps, and rubella-associated encephalitis in the postvaccine era. MRI appeared to be of great diagnostic value. Although no fatalities were observed, deficits did persist in several patients.

Brucellosis is an endemic disease present in many countries worldwide, but it is rare in Europe and North America. Nevertheless brucella is included in the bacteria potentially used for bioterrorism. The aim of this study was the investigation of the antibiotic susceptibility profile of brucella isolates from areas of the eastern Mediterranean where it has been endemic. The susceptibilities of 74 Brucella melitensis isolates derived from clinical samples (57) and animal products (17) were tested in vitro. The strains originate from Crete (59), Cyprus (10), and Syria (5). MICs of tetracycline, rifampicin, streptomycin, gentamicin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and erythromycin were detected by E-test method. The NCCLS criteria for slow growing bacteria were considered to interpret the results. All the isolates were susceptible to tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and levofloxacin. Two isolates presented reduced susceptibility to rifampicin (MIC value: 1.5 mg/l) and eight to SXT (MIC values: 0.75-1.5 mg/l). Erythromycin had the highest (4 mg/l) MIC90value and both norfloxacin and erythromycin the highest (1.5 mg/l) MIC50 value. Brucella isolates remain susceptible in vitro to most antibiotics used for treatment of brucellosis. The establishment of a standardized antibiotic susceptibility method for Brucella spp would be useful for resistance determination in these bacteria and possible evaluation of bioterorism risks.

PMID:17039902	Vojvodić S, Popović S	Med Pregl. 59(5-6):219-24	2006	[The probability of finding HLA identical or partially matched unrelated donors in the population of Vojvodina]. 	Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from unrelated donors are treatments of choice for patients lacking HLA identical siblings or family matched donors. Class I HLA typing was performed by using a standard microlymphocytotoxicity test in 434 unrelated persons from Vojvodina, while, class II HLA typing was performed using a modified immunofluorescent technique. The estimated gene frequencies for the populations of Crete, Korea, China, Scotland, Romania, and North America, were used to calculate phenotype frequencies, the probability of finding HLA identical or partially (in 5/6 HLA antigens) matched unrelated donors, the number of donors necessary for research, as well as genetic distances between populations. The probability of finding HLA identical or partially matched unrelated donors for patients from Vojvodina is higher in closely related populations with low genetic distances, such as populations of Crete, Romania and Scotland. The probability of finding HLA identical or partially matched unrelated donors is in inverse proportion with the number of unrelated donors necessary for research with aim of finding at least one HLA compatible donor. The probability of finding compatible unrelated donors depends on the degree of HLA matching between the donor and recipient, HLA phenotype frequencies and the donor pool size. These methodology may have a wider usage, because it can be applied in calculating the probability of finding suitable genotypically matched donors, by using HLA allele frequencies defined by molecular techniques.

"In the present study, the TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling) assay--a well known technique widely used for detecting fragmented DNA in various types of cells--was used to detect cell death (DNA fragmentation) in a biological model, the early and mid stages of oogenesis of the insect Drosophila melanogaster. The flies were exposed in vivo to either GSM 900-MHz (Global System for Mobile telecommunications) or DCS 1800-MHz (Digital Cellular System) radiation from a common digital mobile phone, for few minutes per day during the first 6 days of their adult life. The exposure conditions were similar to those to which a mobile phone user is exposed, and were determined according to previous studies of ours [D.J. Panagopoulos, A. Karabarbounis, L.H.

Our present results suggest that the decrease in oviposition previously reported, is due to degeneration of large numbers of egg chambers after DNA fragmentation of their constituent cells, induced by both types of mobile telephony radiation. Induced cell death is recorded for the first time, in all types of cells constituting an egg chamber (follicle cells, nurse cells and the oocyte) and in all stages of the early and mid-oogenesis, from germarium to stage 10, during which programmed cell death does not physiologically occur. Germarium and stages 7-8 were found to be the most sensitive developmental stages also in response to electromagnetic stress induced by the GSM and DCS fields and, moreover, germarium was found to be even more sensitive than stages 7-8."

"Ozone flux-response relationships were derived for lettuce, employing a multiplicative approach to model the manner in which stomatal conductance is influenced by key environmental variables, using a dataset collected during field experimentation in Crete and yield-response relationships derived from parallel open-top chamber experiments. Regional agronomic practices were adopted throughout. Computed versus measured data revealed that the derived model explained 51% (P&lt;0.001) of the observed variation in stomatal conductance. Concentration-based indices were compared with flux-based indices. Analyses revealed a significant relationship between accumulated stomatal ozone flux and yield employing flux threshold cut-offs up to 4 nmol m(-2) s(-1). Regressions employing very low or zero flux thresholds resulted in the strongest yield-flux relationships (explaining approximately 80% (P&lt;0.05) of the variation in the dataset)."

Mold spores are universal outdoor and indoor components and generally are recognized as possible sources of respiratory allergies. A 10-year aerobiological study (1994-2003) was conducted in the city of Heraklion located at the center of the Mediterranean island of Crete, Greece. Eighteen mold species exhibiting a normal annual seasonal pattern have been identified and recorded. The most abundant mold species include (a) Cladosporium, (b) Alternaria, (c) miscellaneous ascosporas (d) Leptosphaeria, and (e) basidiomycete Coprinus. In parallel, 571 atopic individuals were tested by skin-prick tests (SPTs). Among these 571 patients 42.5% showed dermal positivity to mold allergens. Most positive SPTs were those of (a) Alternaria, (b) Cladosporium, (c) Fusarium, (d) Aspergillus, and (e) Mucor. No linear relationship was noted between SPT frequencies and percentages of mold species. All of these aerobiological and sensitization data constitute a firm basis for further medical and biological research and application.

Grasses and weeds contain species that produce abundant pollen grains and have been implicated as causative agents in both asthma and allergic rhinitis. In this study, we present the pollen counts of allergenic grasses and weeds on the island of Crete and show their impact on allergic individuals. Heraklion is located at the center of the north shore of Crete and has been monitored with a Burkard 7-day volumetric spore trap since 1994, to determine the identity, concentration, and seasonal variation of airborne pollen grains. Data from 10 consecutive years were recorded, analyzed, and correlated to the growth of respective plants on this island. The island's vegetation and blossoming periods have been investigated by conducting field trips. In parallel, an atopic population of 576 individuals with a convincing history of allergic respiratory disease-rhinitis and/or asthma-was subjected to skin-prick tests with 50 common allergens. Quantitatively, there was a fair agreement between total pollen counts and positive skin-prick test frequencies for Parietaria (Urticaceae family). For the majority of the grass and weed genera, strongly positive skin test responses were observed frequently, despite rather low pollen counts.

Pollen grains from the plant cover of a given area participate largely in the composition of aeroflora (pollen and molds) of this area. Association of allergic respiratory disorders with concentration of allergenic particles in the atmosphere is well documented, and aerobiologic studies are of great relevance. A 10-year volumetric aerobiologic study was conducted in the city of Heraklion, located in the center of the north-shore of the island of Crete, Greece. Main allergenic families and genera encountered were, in descending order of frequency Oleaceae, Quercus, Platanaceae, Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Populus, Moraceae, and Corylaceae. Concentrations noted for most of these aeroallergens were much lower than those reported from other European regions. In parallel, an atopic population of 576 individuals, exhibiting allergic symptoms mainly of the respiratory tract were subjected to a battery of skin-prick tests. A fair degree of agreement between total pollen counts and positive skin-prick test frequencies for the families of Oleaceae, Platanaceae, and Cupressaceae was noted. On the contrary a poor degree of concordance was noted for the rest of the families and genera.

The olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae (Gmelin) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is the most important pest of olives in countries around the Mediterranean basin. Its control has been based mostly on bait sprays with organophosphate insecticides (usually dimethoate or fenthion) for about 40 years. In the present study, the resistance status of olive fruit fly populations to dimethoate was examined in Greece and Cyprus over 2 years. Thirty-one populations from various regions of Greece, nine from Cyprus and one laboratory susceptible strain, which served as a control, were assayed by topical application of dimethoate. Considerable variation in the resistance levels to dimethoate was recorded in the populations of B. oleae, with resistance ratios ranging from 6.3 to 64.4 (ED(50) values 12.5-128.7 ng dimethoate per insect). The highest resistance ratios were found in populations from Crete, and the lowest in those from Cyprus. This variation could be attributed to different selection pressures from insecticidal applications among populations from the various regions. Migration of resistant genotypes, either autonomous or via commerce, may also be involved.

The clinical, epidemiological, and therapeutic aspects of 15 patients with Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), admitted to the Internal Medicine Department of the General Hospital of Sitia (southeastern Crete, Greece) between December 2000 and July 2003, were studied. Diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms and was confirmed by serology. Of the patients studied, 67% were men and 33% women, with a median age of 52 years (range of 23-76 years). Ten cases (67%) were diagnosed between May and July. Of all the patients, 93% had a history of contact with animals, mainly with sheep (11 patients, 73%), while 53% of them had a history of tick-bite (33%), or reported the presence of ticks in their environment (20%). The typical eschar lesion (tache noir) at the tick-bite site was present in 53% of the patients, while the rash was present in 87% of them. Laboratory findings included leukopenia (47%), thrombocytopenia (54%), elevation of transaminases (80%), hyponatremia (33%), and microscopic hematuria (80%). Four patients (27%) displayed pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. All patients were treated with doxycycline (200 mg daily) and recovered rapidly. Renal function deteriorated in one patient with chronic renal failure, but he recovered thereafter.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate for a possible relationship between depression and serum adiponectin and adipose tissue omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA. The sample consisted of 90 healthy adolescent volunteers from the island of Crete. There were 54 girls and 36 boys, aged 13 to 18. The mean age was 15.2 years. Subjects were examined by the Preventive Medicine and Nutrition Clinic of the University of Crete. Depression was assessed through the use of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography in adipose tissue. CES-D correlated with dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (DGLA). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that BDI was negatively associated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), while CES-D was positively associated with DGLA in adipose tissue. Serum adiponectin was not significantly associated with depression. The negative relationship between adipose EPA and depression in adolescents, is in line with findings of previous studies involving adult and elderly subjects, demonstrating negative relations between depression and adipose omega-3 PUFA. This is the first literature report of a relationship between depression and an individual omega-3 fatty acid in adolescents. The inverse relationship between adipose EPA and depression indicates that a low long-term dietary intake of EPA is associated with an increased risk for depression in adolescents.

During the Pleistocene pygmy elephantids, some only a quarter of their ancestors' size, were present on Mediterranean islands until about 10,000 years ago (y.a.). Using a new methodology for ancient DNA (aDNA) studies, the whole genomic multiple displacement amplification method, we were able to retrieve cytochrome b (cytb) DNA fragments from 4200 to 800,000 y.a. specimens from island and mainland samples, including pygmy and normal-sized forms. The short DNA sequence (43 bp) retrieved from the 800,000 y.a. sample is one of the oldest DNA fragment ever retrieved. Duplication of the experiments in two laboratories, the occurrence of three diagnostic sites and the results of the phylogenetic analyses strongly support its authenticity. Our results challenge the prevailing view that pygmy elephantids of the eastern Mediterranean originated exclusively from Elephas, suggesting independent histories of dwarfism and the presence of both pygmy mammoths and elephant-like taxa on these islands. Based on our molecular data, the origin of the Tilos and Cyprus elephantids from a lineage within the genus Elephas is confirmed, while the DNA sequence from the Cretan sample falls clearly within the mammoth clade. Thus, the name Mammuthus creticus rather than Elephas creticus, seems to be justified for this form. Our findings also suggest a need to re-evaluate the evolutionary history of the Sicilian/Maltese species, traditionally included in the genus Elephas.

To evaluate the effect of a campaign for proper education of the public on the risk of foreign body aspiration in children. A retrospective analysis of 87 endoscopic foreign body removals in children was performed at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital of Crete, during the period between January 2000 and December 2004. Results were compared with those of a previous study conducted by the same Department during the period between 1991 and 1999. A foreign body was discovered in 44 cases, while in 43 cases there were no findings. Twenty-one foreign bodies (47.73%) were found in the right main bronchus, 20 foreign bodies (45.45%) were found in the left main bronchus and 3 (6.82%) in the trachea. Both crude and age-standardized bronchoscopy rates appear to be lower in the time period 2000-2004, as compared to the time period prior to the educational program. The decline in the total number of bronchoscopies during recent years has been a result of a campaign for proper education of the public and especially parents, caretakers and families. All aspects of the educational campaign are described in detail. The risk of high morbidity and mortality from foreign body aspiration makes it mandatory to increase even more the awareness of the general population.
PMID:17162331	Matalas AL	Int J Food Sci Nutr. 57(7-8):529-36	2006	Disparities within traditional Mediterranean food patterns: an historical approach of the Greek diet. 	The scope of this study was to address the historical features underpinning the Greek variant of the Mediterranean diet and to examine whether relevant differences exist among dietary patterns followed in Greece prior to World War II and those recorded in the 1960s within the Seven Countries Study framework. For this purpose, archival data on family budgets were used to extract information on food availability and composition of the diets followed by two rural Greek populations prior to World War II. Results indicate that diets followed by rural Greeks in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century were characterized by a low availability of fat sources, olive oil included. Lipids represented 22-27% of the total available energy, saturated fatty acids accounted for less than 10% of the total energy, while monounsaturated fatty acids contributed 8-9% of the energy. Our results suggest that although the dietary patterns of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century are in line with the Cretan diet of the 1960s with regards to saturated fat intake, important differences can be traced with regards to total and monounsaturated fat intake. These findings suggest that the model of the Mediterranean diet represents a dietary pattern that has not persisted over a long time period in the region.

This Article extends the geometric analysis of slow invariant manifolds in explosive kinetics developed by Creta et al. to three-dimensional and higher systems. Invariant manifolds can be characterized by different families of Lyapunov-type numbers, based either on the relative growth of normal to tangential perturbations or on the deformation of m-dimensional volume elements (if the manifold is m-dimensional) and of the complementary (n - m)-elements in the normal orthogonal complement. The latter approach, based on elementary concepts of exterior algebra, is particularly simple because the evolution of the relevant volume elements can be related to suitable local stretching rates, and local analysis can be performed directly from the knowledge of the Jacobian matrix of the vector field. Several examples of bifurcations of the points-at-infinity, which modify the manifold structure, are discussed for 3-D models of exothermic reactions.

Morganella morganii is a commensal Gram-negative bacillus of the intestinal tract of humans and other mammals and reptiles. Few reports exist in the literature regarding infections caused by this organism. A retrospective study at the 650-bed University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece was performed during a 4-year period (2001-2004) to identify and analyze infections caused by M. morganii. Twenty-four patients had M. morganii isolated from clinical specimens during the study period. Thirteen patients (54%) suffered from skin and soft tissue infections, five from pyelonephritis, three from female genital tract infections, one from pneumonia, one from gangrenous appendicitis, and one from tonsillitis. M. morganii was a constituent of polymicrobial infections in 14 patients (58%). The patients received various antibiotics, i.e., six patients received ciprofloxacin, four piperacillin/tazobactam, two amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, one ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, one ceftriaxone, one imipenem, and one cefuroxime monotherapy, whereas the remaining eight received antibiotic combinations. Two (both debilitated) of 24 patients (8%) died, despite antibiotic treatment. Skin and soft tissue infection was the commonest type of infection due to M. morganii in our series. M. morganii is commonly a part of polymicrobial infections and can rarely cause fatalities in debilitated patients.

"To explore the association of allergic rhinitis with the use of pesticides among grape farmers in Crete. A cross-sectional study of 120 grape farmers and 100 controls at the Malevisi region in Northern Crete was conducted. The protocol consisted of a questionnaire, skin prick tests for 16 common allergens, measurement of specific IgE antibodies against 8 allergens, and spirometry before and after bronchodilatation. Grape farmers who used pesticides had higher prevalence rates of allergic rhinitis symptoms (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4 to 6.2) compared with grape farmers who reported no current use of pesticides, and control subjects. Logistic regression models controlling for age, sex and smoking status showed that 6 of the 12 predefined groups of major pesticides were significantly related to allergic rhinitis symptoms. The highest risks were observed for paraquat and other bipyridyl herbicides (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.8), dithiocarbamate fungicides (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.3) and carbamate insecticides (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4 to 6.5). A factor analysis of pesticides used identified 3 distinct factors. The most common factor was that of multiple pesticide use that included 9 pesticides and was significantly associated with allergic rhinitis (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.3). ORs were higher when allergic rhinitis was defined using both questionnaire data on symptoms and atopy. Occupational exposure to multiple agricultural chemicals could be related to allergic rhinitis in grape farmers."

The Greek Orthodox Christian (GOC) diet is a periodic vegetarian-type diet that shares all the characteristics of the Mediterranean diet. No study to date has investigated its impact on blood pressure (BP). Thirty-eight devout Orthodox Christian fasters and 29 matched controls living in Crete, Greece, were followed for 1 year during 2001. BP data were gathered before (pre) and near completion (end) of the three major fasting periods of the Orthodox Christian calendar [Christmas (40 days)-Easter (48 days)-Assumption (15 days)] along with other information on their dietary and lifestyle habits, body measurements and blood samples. Throughout the study fasters had higher mean SBP and DBP than controls. No fasting period had a significant BP lowering effect on fasters. Fasters' prevalence of end-Christmas and end-Lent high-normal BP was significantly higher than that of the controls', while it was reduced during the Assumption and reached the very low levels of controls'. On the whole, compared to controls, fasters increased their fiber, magnesium and fruit and vegetable consumption during the fasting periods and decreased their sodium and calcium intake. BMI and blood lipids were significantly associated with SBP/DBP at almost all measurements. Religious adherence to a periodic vegetarian Mediterranean-style diet does not have an observable effect on BP. Further research is needed in order to establish conclusive evidence.

"We sought to describe CNS involvement as initial presentation of autoimmune rheumatic diseases using a standardized nomenclature. A 6-year observational study (1999-2005) was conducted in the University Hospital of Heraklion Crete, a regional referral secondary/tertiary care academic center. Patients presenting with new neurological symptoms of acute/subacute onset underwent clinical and laboratory screening for systemic autoimmune disorders. The diagnosis of an autoimmune rheumatic disorder was based upon the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria, whereas for primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) we used the Sapporo preliminary criteria. In order to describe the neurological syndromes we used the ACR nomenclature for neuropsychiatric lupus. During this period fourteen patients (ten females and four males) were recorded. Eight patients had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), four had primary APS and the remaining two had systemic vasculitis. Four out of the eight SLE patients had secondary APS. Two of them presented with movement disorder (chorea). The other two and all four patients with primary APS presented with cerebrovascular disease (CVD). These six patients comprised the 5.7% of young adults under &lt; 45 years old with cerebrovascular accident admitted over the 6-year period. SLE and APS either primary or secondary to SLE were the most common underlying systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, in patients presenting with a neurological event of acute onset. Young adults (&lt; 45 years old) with CVD should undertake screening for SLE/APS."

"To examine the long-term effects of the 'Cretan Health and Nutrition Education Program' on blood pressure. A representative population of 176 pupils (85 from the intervention schools and 91 from the control schools). Blood pressure, dietary, anthropometrical and physical activity data were obtained at baseline (academic year 1992-1993) and at follow-up examination (academic year 2001-2002). The findings of the current study revealed that the increase over the 10-year period in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was higher in the control group (CG) than in the intervention group (IG) (P=0.003 and P&lt;0.001 respectively). Regarding dietary indices, the IG were found to have a significantly higher intake of potassium (P=0.018) and magnesium (P=0.011) compared to the CG. Furthermore, the decrease in body mass index (BMI) z-score observed in the IG was found to differentiate significantly from the increase observed in the CG (P=0.042). On the contrary, the increase in leisure time, moderate to vigorous physical activities (MVPA) observed in the IG, was found to differentiate significantly from the decrease observed in the CG (P=0.032). Intervention's effect on SBP was mediated by changes in MVPA (beta=-0.20, P=0.030) and BMI (beta=0.19, P=0.048). Similarly, intervention's effect on DBP was mediated by changes in MVPA (beta=-0.18, P=0.048), BMI (beta=0.26, P=0.007) and magnesium intake (beta=-0.20, P=0.048). The findings of the current study are encouraging, indicating favorable changes in blood pressure, micronutrients intake, BMI and physical activity over the 10 years of follow-up and 4 years after program's cessation, thus providing some support for the effectiveness of school-based health education programs in successfully tackling certain chronic disease risk factors early in life."

Data coming from one natural population of D. subobscura, that of Crete, are presented in detail and examined for nonrandom associations of genes and gene arrangements. This population and four others previously studied are reanalyzed for the detection of higher than first-order interactions. Only first-order interactions are important and statistically significant, especially those concerning genes and inversions in which these genes are included. The paucity of linkage disequilibria detected is remarkable, and we argue that it does not depend on the methods of study, rather it is genuine. We further argue that most of the disequilibria detected are probably due to mechanisms based on epistatic selection. 
PMID:17254747	Bourre JM	Biomed Pharmacother. 61(2-3):105-12	2007	Dietary omega-3 fatty acids for women.	"This review details the specific needs of women for omega-3 fatty acids, including alpha linoleic acid (ALA) and the very long chain fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Omega-3 fatty acid (dietary or in capsules) ensures that a woman's adipose tissue contains a reserve of these fatty acids for the developing fetus and the breast-fed newborn infant. This ensures the optimal cerebral and cognitive development of the infant. The presence of large quantities of EPA and DHA in the diet slightly lengthens pregnancy, and improves its quality. Human milk contains both ALA and DHA, unlike that of other mammals. Conditions such as diabetes can alter the fatty acid profile of mother's milk, while certain diets, like those of vegetarians, vegans, or even macrobiotic diets, can have the same effect, if they do not include seafood. ALA, DHA and EPA, are important for preventing ischemic cardiovascular disease in women of all ages. Omega-3 fatty acids can help to prevent the development of certain cancers, particularly those of the breast and colon, and possibly of the uterus and the skin, and are likely to reduce the risk of postpartum depression, manic-depressive psychosis, dementias (Alzheimer's disease and others), hypertension, toxemia, diabetes and, to a certain extend, age-related macular degeneration. Omega-3 fatty acids could play a positive role in the prevention of menstrual syndrome and postmenopausal hot flushes. The normal western diet contains little ALA (less than 50% of the RDA). The only adequate sources are rapeseed oil (canola), walnuts and so-called ""omega-3"" eggs (similar to wild-type or Cretan eggs). The amounts of EPA and DHA in the diet vary greatly from person to person. The only good sources are fish and seafood, together with ""omega-3"" eggs."
PMID:17257336	Arfib B, de Marsily G, Ganoulis J	Ground Water. 45(1):28-35	2007	Locating the zone of saline intrusion in a coastal karst aquifer using springflow data. 	Coastal fresh water aquifers are an increasingly desirable resource. In a karstic aquifer, sea water intrusion occurs as a salt water wedge, like in porous media. However, preferential flow conduits may alter the spatial and temporal distribution of the salt water. This is typically the case when the outlet of the aquifer is a brackish spring. This paper shows that salinity and flow rate variations at a spring, where salinity is inversely proportional to discharge, can help to understand the hydrodynamic functioning of the aquifer and to locate the fresh water-sea water mixing zone deep inside the aquifer. The volume of water-filled conduit between the sea water intrusion zone and the spring outlet is calculated by the integral over time of the flow rate during the time lag between the flow rate increase and the salinity decrease as measured at the spring. In the example of the spring at Almyros of Heraklio (Crete, Greece), this time lag is variable, depending on the discharge, but the volume of water-filled conduit appears to be constant, which shows that the processes of salt water intrusion and mixing in the conduit are constant throughout the year. The distance between the spring and the zone where sea water enters the conduit is estimated and provides an indication of the position where only fresh water is present in the conduit.

The island of Crete, credited by some historical scholars as a central crucible of western civilization, has been under continuous archeological investigation since the second half of the nineteenth century. In the present work, the geographic stratification of the contemporary Cretan Y-chromosome gene pool was assessed by high-resolution haplotyping to investigate the potential imprints of past colonization episodes and the population substructure. In addition to analyzing the possible geographic origins of Y-chromosome lineages in relatively accessible areas of the island, this study includes samples from the isolated interior of the Lasithi Plateau--a mountain plain located in eastern Crete. The potential significance of the results from the latter region is underscored by the possibility that this region was used as a Minoan refugium. Comparisons of Y-haplogroup frequencies among three Cretan populations as well as with published data from additional Mediterranean locations revealed significant differences in the frequency distributions of Y-chromosome haplogroups within the island. The most outstanding differences were observed in haplogroups J2 and R1, with the predominance of haplogroup R lineages in the Lasithi Plateau and of haplogroup J lineages in the more accessible regions of the island. Y-STR-based analyses demonstrated the close affinity that R1a1 chromosomes from the Lasithi Plateau shared with those from the Balkans, but not with those from lowland eastern Crete. In contrast, Cretan R1b microsatellite-defined haplotypes displayed more resemblance to those from Northeast Italy than to those from Turkey and the Balkans.

A novel, Gram-negative, non-motile, non-sporulating, rod-shaped bacterium isolated from a viscous two-phase olive-oil mill waste ('alpeorujo') is described. The strain, designated AW-6T, is an obligate aerobe, forming irregular, pigmented creamy white colonies. The pH and temperature ranges for growth were pH 5-8 and 5-45 degrees C, with optimal pH and temperature for growth of pH 6-7 and 28-32 degrees C, respectively. Strain AW-6T was chemo-organotrophic and utilized mostly D+ -glucose, protocatechuate and D+ -xylose, followed by L-cysteine, D- -fructose, D+ -galactose, L-histidine, lactose, sorbitol and sucrose. Menaquinone-7 was detected in the respiratory chain of strain AW-6T. The major fatty acids of strain AW-6T were C(16 : 1)omega7c and/or iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH, iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and C(16 : 0). The closest phylogenetic relative of strain AW-6T was clone BIti35 (89.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), while Sphingobacterium thalpophilum DSM 11723T was the closest recognized relative within the Sphingobacteriaceae (88.2 % similarity). Strain AW-6T showed a low level of DNA-DNA relatedness to S. thalpophilum DSM 11723T (33.8-37.0 %). The DNA G+C content of strain AW-6T was 45.6 mol%. Physiological and chemotaxonomic data further confirmed the distinctiveness of strain AW-6T from members of the genera Sphingobacterium and Pedobacter. Thus, strain AW-6T is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus within the family Sphingobacteriaceae, for which the name Olivibacter sitiensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AW-6T =DSM 17696T=CECT 7133T).

"Rapid assessment of immune status in neonatal ruminants of endangered species facilitates early intervention in cases of inadequate passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulins. Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was used to evaluate suspected passive transfer status in 25 North Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak vaginalis), 45 Cretan goats (Capra algagrus cretica), 20 white-lipped deer (Cervus albirostris), 25 Mhorr gazelles (Gazella dama mhorr), and 31 Soemmerring's gazelles (Gazella soemmerringi soemmerringi). Serum GGT, measured within 48 hr of birth, was compared with clinical condition at 5 days of age. Neonatal Soemmerring's and Mhorr gazelles with GGT &gt; 600 U/L were likely to survive without medical intervention, whereas GGT &lt; 400 U/L was a good indicator that the gazelle neonate would need medical intervention. Neonatal muntjac with GGT &gt; 200 U/L were also likely to survive without medical intervention. Because there is no gold standard for evaluating passive transfer status in neonatal nondomestic ruminants, it is recommended to evaluate the results of more than one diagnostic test, as well as clinical condition, in considering health status and disposition of neonatal ruminants of endangered species."

Salivary gland tumors constitute a highly heterogeneous group. There are few large epidemiological studies of benign and malignant salivary gland tumors in Greece. The aim of the present study was to define the pattern of parotid gland neoplasms on the island of Crete. The medical records of 131 patients who underwent parotidectomy in the Otorhinolaryngology department of the University hospital of Heraklion over the last ten years were retrospectively reviewed. Gender and age of the patients, size, location, and histology of the tumors, as well as postoperative complications were analyzed and tabulated. There were 101 (77.1%) benign parotid gland tumors and 30 (22.9%) of malignant ones. The most common benign tumor was pleomorphic adenoma (44.2%), while the most common malignant tumor was mucoepidermoid carcinoma (5.3%). The female-to-male ratio was 1.18/1.00. Median age was 48.2 years (range: 16-75 years) in patients with benign tumors and 65.4 years (range: 27-90 years) in patients with malignancy. After superficial parotidectomy, the most common postoperative complication was Frey syndrome (8.1%), while after total parotidectomy the most frequent complication was transient facial nerve palsy (45.5%). On Crete, parotid gland tumors show epidemiological characteristics similar to studies worldwide. Benign parotid tumors are largely more frequent than malignant tumors. The most common benign parotid gland tumor was pleomorphic adenoma, while the most frequent malignant tumor was mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Future research needs to be done to better define the epidemiology of these tumors among the Greek population.

Alu elements are the most abundant mobile elements in the human genome (approximately 1,100,000 copies). Polymorphic Alu elements have been proved to be useful in studies of human origins and relationships owing to two important advantages: identity by descent and absence of the Alu element known to be the ancestral state. Alu variation in the X chromosome has been described previously in human populations but, as far as we know, these elements have not been used in population relationship studies. Here, we describe the allele frequencies of 13 'young' Alu elements of the X chromosome (Ya5DP62, Ya5DP57, Yb8DP49, Ya5a2DP1, Yb8DP2, Ya5DP3, Ya5NBC37, Yd3JX437, Ya5DP77, Ya5NBC491, Yb8NBC578, Ya5DP4 and Ya5DP13) in six human populations from sub-Saharan Africa (the Ivory Coast), North Africa (Moroccan High Atlas, Siwa oasis in Egypt, Tunisia), Greece (Crete Island) and Spain (Basque Country). Eight out of 13 Alu elements have shown remarkably high gene diversity values in all groups (average heterozygosities: 0.342 in the Ivory Coast, 0.250 in North Africa, 0.209 in Europe). Genetic relationships agree with a geographical pattern of differentiation among populations, with some peculiar features observed in North Africans. Crete Island and the Basque Country show the lowest genetic distance (0.0163) meanwhile Tunisia, in spite of its geographical location, lies far from the other two North African samples. The results of our work demonstrate that X chromosome Alu elements comprise a reliable set of genetic markers useful to describe human population relationships for fine-scale geographical studies.

Mumps is an infectious disease, occurring rarely in many countries including Greece, where approximately 50 cases are reported each year. In Crete, Greece's biggest island, an average number of four cases are reported annually. The study population consists of all patients hospitalised because of mumps in our clinic. Clinical, laboratory and serological confirmation of the disease has been performed. During the tourist summer periods of 2004 and 2005, 39 patients with mumps have been hospitalized in our clinic in Crete. All patients but one were young tourists from Britain. The patients presented with parotid gland swelling and fever and some developed complications of the disease as well. The above findings are consistent with the mumps epidemic, now occurring in the UK. The disease is spreading among the Greek population as well, since six cases have been reported. This study investigates the reasons for this epidemic, focusing on the role of MMR vaccination.

"Atopy is not uncommon among children living in rural Crete, but wheeze and rhinitis are rare. A study was undertaken to examine whether this discrepancy could be attributed to a high consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables or adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet. A cross-sectional survey was performed in 690 children aged 7-18 years in rural Crete. Parents completed a questionnaire on their child's respiratory and allergic symptoms and a 58-item food frequency questionnaire. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet was measured using a scale with 12 dietary items. Children underwent skin prick tests with 10 common aeroallergens. 80% of children ate fresh fruit (and 68% vegetables) at least twice a day. The intake of grapes, oranges, apples, and fresh tomatoes-the main local products in Crete-had no association with atopy but was protective for wheezing and rhinitis. A high consumption of nuts was found to be inversely associated with wheezing (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.98), whereas margarine increased the risk of both wheeze (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.01 to 4.82) and allergic rhinitis (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.31 to 3.37). A high level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was protective for allergic rhinitis (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.64) while a more modest protection was observed for wheezing and atopy. The results of this study suggest a beneficial effect of commonly consumed fruits, vegetables and nuts, and of a high adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet during childhood on symptoms of asthma and rhinitis. Diet may explain the relative lack of allergic symptoms in this population."

To investigate the increased incidence of papillary thyroid cancer as found in specimens of total thyroidectomies and potential correlation with etiological factors. A retrospective study on patients who underwent total thyroidectomy, from 1990 to 2004, in an academic tertiary referral medical center. Patients' records were placed in a database, which included medical condition, history, and demographics. Histopathological slides were reviewed with special focus on papillary cancer. Our series consisted of 2379 patients. Thyroid cancer was confirmed in 354 patients (14.88%). Papillary carcinoma represented the most frequent type (316 patients, 89.26%). Increased incidence of papillary carcinomas was noticed after 1995, reaching the maximum value in the year 2000. After 2000, there was a descending trend and then a plateau. The increased incidence of papillary thyroid cannot be attributed to dietary patterns or increased diagnostic and therapeutic activity. It is likely to be associated with increased radiation and may be associated with the Chernobyl fallout.

"Coxsackieviruses are human enteroviruses, which have been associated with myocarditis/pericarditis and sudden death. In one investigation (Spanakis N, Manolis EN, Tsakris A, Tsiodras S, Panagiotopoulos T, Saroglou G, and Legakis NJ: J Clin Pathol 2005;58:357-360), a cluster of cases of fatal myocarditis in Greece was linked to coxsackievirus B3. The information from this investigation prompted us to study serologically the prevalence of coxsackieviruses B throughout Greece. Sera were obtained from 506 healthy blood donors from various transfusion centers, covering the entire country. All sera were tested for the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies, using ELISAs with various antigenic specificities: (1) heat-denatured coxsackievirus type B1 and B5 virions, (2) a synthetic peptide from the N terminus of the VP1 protein of coxsackievirus B3, and (3) a synthetic peptide from the N terminus of the VP1 protein of coxsackievirus B4. Sera positive for IgG antibodies against coxsackieviruses B1/B5, B3, and B4 were detected in 6.7 to 21.6% of the individuals tested in the various regions of Greece. Statistical analysis revealed that the highest prevalence of IgG antibodies against coxsackieviruses B1/B5 was found in blood donors from Crete (p = 0.025), whereas the highest prevalence against coxsackievirus B4 was detected in blood donors from Athens (p = 0.01). IgM antibodies against coxsackievirus B were detected at low percentage, less than 5%, with no significant viral preference for particular geographic regions. The preference of anti-coxsackievirus IgG antibodies for particular geographic regions could be potentially related to the previously reported clustering of cases of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and myocarditis in Athens and Crete, respectively."

Poulakakis and colleagues (Poulakakis et al. 2006: Biol. Lett. 2, 451-454), report the recovery of 'authentic' mammoth DNA from an 800,000-year-old fragment of bone excavated on the island of Crete. In light of results from other ancient DNA studies that indicate how DNA survival is unlikely in samples, which are recovered from warm environments and are relatively old (e.g. more than 100,000 years), these findings come as a great surprise. Here, we show that problems exist with the methodological approaches used in the study. First, the nested PCR technique as reported is nonsensical--one of the second round 'nested' primers falls outside the amplicon of the first round PCR. More worryingly, the binding region of one of the first round primers (Elcytb320R) falls within the short 43 base pair reported mammoth sequence, specifically covering two of the three reportedly diagnostic Elephas polymorphisms. Finally, we demonstrate using a simple BLAST search in GenBank that the claimed 'uniquely derived character state' for mammoths is in fact also found within modern elephants.

Pigmy elephants inhabited the islands from the Mediterranean region during the Pleistocene period but became extinct in the course of the Holocene. Despite striking distinctive anatomical characteristics related to insularity, some similarities with the lineage of extant Asian elephants have suggested that pigmy elephants could be most probably seen as members of the genus Elephas. Poulakakis et al (2006) have recently challenged this view by recovering a short mtDNA sequence from an 800 000 year old fossil of the Cretan pigmy elephant (Elephas creticus). According to the authors of this study, a deep taxonomic revision of Cretan dwarf elephants would be needed, as the sequence exhibits clear affinities with woolly mammoth haplotypes. However, we point here many aspects that seriously weaken the strength of the ancient DNA evidence reported.

The average summer equivalent population treated by the plant exceeded 50,000, falling to under 5,000 in the winter. The samples were analyzed for total coliforms number (TC in cfu / 100 mL) and residual chlorine concentration (RCHL in mg/L). In almost 60% of the samples the TC number was so large that it could be safe to suggest that the WWTP and distribution system failed to reach the EPA standards for wastewater reuse for tree irrigation (faecal coliforms &lt; or = 200 cfu/100 mL and RCHL &lt; 1 mg/L) due mainly to inflow and septage handling, above designed limits. The licensing operational and reuse standards were set in TC &lt; or = 500 cfu/100 mL, where 76% of the analyzed samples recorded larger values. It was also estimated that in 14% of the samples the wastewater quality failed to reach even the less strict WHO standards of FC &lt; or = 1.000 cfu/100 mL. When chlorination was properly adjusted the effluent quality was improved (last three sets of samplings for each collection point), helped by the WWTP inflow decrease. As a result the values recorded in all tanks and collectors were also improved. However, even then, the required licensing standards were randomly and barely achieved. This suggests that specific wastewater quality standard at the exit of a WWTP do not guarantee that the wastewater will still retain these characteristics at its final application point."

"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) account as a reason for frequent consultations in primary care. However, the magnitude of the problem at the GP's clinic, the patterns of pain and the consulting behaviour has not been sufficiently explored. The aim of this study was to report on patterns of pain relevant to MSDs and explore the co-morbidities and consulting behaviour in rural primary care settings in Crete. Three primary care centres (PCCs) of Crete were selected for a study period of 2 weeks. Every visitor, aged 20-75 years, regardless of the reason for visiting the facility was invited to participate. The Greek version of the general Nordic questionnaire for the analysis of musculoskeletal disorders (NMQ) was used for data collection. A total of 455 subjects answered the NMQ. Three hundred and seventy-six (82.6%) of the study population reported having one or more symptoms during the previous year. Low back (56.9%), neck (34.1%), shoulder (29.9%) and knee (27.9%) were the commonest sites of pain. In almost half cases (48.6%), the complaints about pain were accompanied by activity restrictions. Multivariate statistical analysis showed significant correlations with increasing age and female gender (P &lt; 0.05). Common chronic conditions were associated with co-morbidities from the musculoskeletal system. Only one-third of those who reported MSDs had consulted their GPs for the same problems within the previous year. MSDs are highly prevalent among rural population in Crete but fewer patients seek care than those who report symptoms."

Several extracts of Origanum dictamnus, an endemic plant of Greece growing only in the island of Crete and the bioassay-directed isolated ursolic acid, were tested in vitro against the P388 (murine leukemia) and the human bronchial epidermoid cancer NSCLC-N6 (non small cell lung cancer) cell lines. Both the initial dichloromethane extract and the isolated from it ursolic acid exhibited cytotoxic activity. Ursolic acid was also tested in vivo, on murine ascite leukemia P388, where it exhibited at a dose of 50 mg/kg a marginal antileukemic activity.

"Smoking is Greece's largest public health threat. Greece has the highest adult smoking prevalence among all E.U countries, which in turn possibly predisposes Greek children and adolescents to smoke. The purpose of our study was to research into the smoking habits of preschool children's parents since children of that age could be vulnerable to parental negative role modeling and to investigate into the necessity of conducting a public health awareness programme aimed at the general population. A cross-sectional study was performed on the parents of children enrolled in kindergarten in western Crete-Greece (2809 parents), and interviewed during the 2004-2005 Cretan school health promotion programme. 63% of households had at least one parent a current smoker and in 26% both parents were found to be current smokers. Smoking prevalence among adults with preschool children was estimated at 44% (52% of fathers and 36% of mothers). Paternal education and nationality were statistically significantly related to smoking (p &lt; 0.001), unlike place of residence (p = 0.862) and level of maternal education (p = 0.132). Smoking prevalence is high even among parents with preschool children. Taking into account the parents' significant primary role in the children's upbringing and the effect that parental induced passive smoking has on children's health and health attitude; one can deduce that the health of Greek children is under threat. It is of major importance that educational and policy intervention measures are implemented to reduce such a situation that could contribute to promoting the initiation of smoking among Greek adolescents."

Informed consent is a question of central importance in contemporary medical ethics, and clinical practice is inconceivable without considering the issues it raises. Although it is often vigorously argued that consent, informed or otherwise, is a recent phenomenon and that no sources testify to its existence before the 20th century, it is difficult to accept that a process for regulating the common and fundamental parameters in the relationship between doctor and patient and the planning of treatment had not concerned previous eras. A review of the Registers of the Islamic Court of Candia (Heraklion) in Crete, a series of records that touches on, among other things, matters of medical interest, reveals that the concept of informed consent was not only known during a period that stretched from the mid-17th to the early 19th century, but it was concerned with the same principles that prevail or have been a point of contention today. An extension of this study into other periods may thus provide contemporary researchers with material and information valuable in the discussion of today's bioethical issues.

Two constructed wetland systems, treating domestic wastewater, are compared in terms of performance and costs. One is a free water surface (FWS) wetland system located in Pompia, Crete, south Greece, and the other one is a vertical subsurface flow (VSF) wetland system located in Comati, Chalkidiki, north Greece. The FWS system is designed for 1200 p.e. Its construction cost was Euro 305,000, and the capital, operation and maintenance cost was Euro 22.07 p.e.(-1) yr(-1) or Euro 0.50 m(-3) of influent. The VSF system is designed for 1000 p.e. Its construction cost was Euro 410,850, and the capital, operation and maintenance cost was Euro 36.81 p.e.(-1) yr(-1) or Euro 0.56 m(-3) of influent. Both systems achieved high removal rates for BOD5, COD, TSS, TKN, phosphorus, TC, and FC, which makes them ideal for small communities in the Mediterranean region.

The log MAR visual acuity (VA) chart developed for use in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) is composed of 10 Sloan letters, which are not used in the Greek, Cyrillic, and Central European alphabets. In this study we evaluate a modified ETDRS chart, the University of Crete (UoC) chart, which contains a set of letters readable by all European citizens. In the UoC charts, the letters C, D, R, N, V, S, and Z were substituted with E, P, B, X, Y, A, and T, respectively. The similarity between the modified and the standard acuity charts was evaluated using two procedures. First, VA of 227 secondary school children (454 eyes) was evaluated using both sets of charts. Second, the relative difficulty for the identification of individual Sloan letters used in both charts, as well as letter M, was assessed from psychometric functions for five subjects. Bland-Altman plots revealed no statistical significant differences in the value of VA between the standard and the UoC set of charts. Although, estimates of identification log MAR threshold showed relatively significant interletter variability, in total, the new set of Sloan letters was equally identifiable with the original set. The overall pattern of results suggests that the modified log MAR UoC charts forms a valid alternative to the ETDRS for assessing VA in multinational clinical trials, offering the advantage of containing letters recognizable by a wider population basis, such as European citizens, as well as subjects from countries using the Cyrillic alphabet.

"Placenta creta (accreta, increta, or percreta) is a clinically symptomatic condition, usually diagnosed histologically on hysterectomy specimens. At a minimum, focal absence of decidua is the histological finding for this condition; however, excessive amounts of extravillous trophoblasts were recently documented on hysterectomy specimens. The histological finding of basal plate myometrial fibers (BPMF) without intervening decidua in spontaneously delivered placentas, which we term occult placenta accreta (OPA), is not infrequent, even in clinically asymptomatic cases. To prove that OPA is a missing link between normal placental implantation and clinical placenta accreta, CD146 immunohistochemical stains were performed on 25 sections of OPA (study group) and 25 placental sections without BPMF (control group). Implantation-site intermediate trophoblast (ISIT) cell number, thickness, and density were compared between the study and control groups. The ISIT micrometry thickness and cell number at BPMF sites were statistically significantly higher in OPA than in control group and same OPA placentas away from BPMF. There were no statistically significant differences in ISIT density. Therefore, although asymptomatic, OPA features the same histopathology as clinical placenta accreta and may share same pathogenesis, which may include decidual deficiency, abnormal trophoblast/decidua interaction, and/or hypoxia."

Congenital toxoplasmosis is associated with clinical dilemmas as untreated infants may have a guarded prognosis and as treatment may induce severe side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the outcome of infants born to mothers with toxoplasmosis acquired during pregnancy, following administration of appropriate regimens both during pregnancy and early infancy. All 35 infants, born to mothers with toxoplasmosis acquired during pregnancy, and referred to the major Neonatal Department in Crete, Greece, during the 7-year period 1997-2003 were included. All neonates were evaluated soon after birth and on a regular follow-up. Almost all mothers received spiramycin from diagnosis through labor and 2 received pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. At birth, infants had IgG antibody titers ranging from 1/1,350 to 1/109,350. All infants initially received pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine and folinic acid but in only 4 cases treatment was continued beyond the second month of life. Transient neutropenia was commonly observed. A follow-up period of 1.2-8.2 years did not reveal any remarkable sequelae. Our findings suggest that effective treatment both during pregnancy and early infancy is safe and may contribute to a good outcome of infants born to mothers with toxoplasmosis acquired during pregnancy.

The aim of the present study was to identify the organisms responsible for community acquired febrile UTI in children and to investigate their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. A 5-y prospective analysis was performed in children hospitalized for a first episode of UTI, in Crete, Greece. A total of 262 children, 40.1% males and 59.9% females, aged 0.08 to 13 y, were enrolled in the study. Escherichia coli (E. coli) was the leading uropathogen. Antimicrobial resistance of E. coli isolates was most commonly to ampicillin (56.4%) followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (27.3%), cefaclor (22.5%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (15.5%), gentamicin (4.9%), cefuroxime (3.1%), nitrofurantoin (2.6%), and ceftriaxone (1.6%). Interestingly, a significant decrease in E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX was observed during the study period. Resistance to ampicillin, TMP-SMX and cefaclor was noted for 61%, 28% and 27% of the total uropathogens, respectively, making these agents inappropriate for empirical treatment of febrile UTI in our region. A larger number of pathogens may be empirically treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate. More than 90% of the uropathogens are susceptible to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and nitrofurantoin. In conclusion, several of the first-line agents for empirical treatment of childhood UTI seem to have become ineffective in the area of this study.

"Oxidative stress may accelerate ageing and increase the risk of chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD). We assessed differences in oxidative stress, and iron and antioxidant status between elderly men living in Mediterranean southern Europe (Crete, Greece) and northern Europe (Zutphen, The Netherlands). A cross-sectional study using data from two cohorts of the Seven Countries Study. Non-fasting blood samples were drawn in 2000 from 105 men from Crete and 139 men from Zutphen, all aged 79 years or over. All assays were performed in the same laboratory. After multiple adjustments, serum levels of the markers of oxidative stress were lower in Cretan men than in men from Zutphen, as indicated by lower mean levels of hydroperoxides (33.2 versus 57.3 micromol/l; P=0.005) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (20.3 versus 26.1 U/l; P=0.003). The most pronounced difference in iron status was a twofold lower mean serum ferritin level in Cretan men (69.8 microg/l) compared with men from Zutphen (134.2 microg/l; P&lt;0.0001). Men from Crete had consistently higher plasma levels of major plasma antioxidants than the Zutphen men, including a nearly fourfold higher mean level of lycopene (15.3 versus 4.1 microg/100 ml; P&lt;0.0001). Elderly men from Crete had consistently lower levels of the indicators of oxidative stress and iron status and higher concentrations of major antioxidants than men from Zutphen. These differences may contribute to the lower rate of CHD and total mortality that has been observed in this cohort of Cretan men."

An earlier study revealed the strong phylogeographical structure of the lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura suaveolens group) within the northern Palaearctic. Here, we aim to reconstruct the colonization history of Mediterranean islands and to clarify the biogeography and phylogeographical relationships of the poorly documented Middle East region with the northern Palaearctic. We performed analyses on 998-bp-long haplotypes of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of 143 samples collected around the Mediterranean basin, including islands and the Middle East. The analyses suggest that the Cypriot shrew belongs to the rare group of relict insular Pleistocene mammal taxa that have survived to the present day. In contrast, the Cretan, Corsican and Menorcan populations were independently introduced from the Middle East during the Holocene. The phylogeographical structure of this temperate Palaearctic species within the Middle East appears to be complex and rich in diversity, probably reflecting fragmentation of the area by numerous mountain chains. Four deeply divergent clades of the C. suaveolens group occur in the area, meaning that a hypothetical contact zone remains to be located in central western Iran.

The mobility of copper (Cu) was studied in 13 soil samples from greenhouses in Falasarna, northwestern Crete, Greece. The spatial variability of Cu concentration in greenhouse soils and their physicochemical characteristics were examined. The results showed that the concentrations varied considerably, between 15 and 4900 ppb. Sorption and leaching experiments--kinetic and equilibrium--were conducted in uncontaminated and contaminated soils, respectively. Both leaching and sorption equilibrium experiments were performed as a function of pH. The leaching experiment results indicated that the total dissolved Cu concentration was between 10 and 15 ppb at a pH of 7.5, which is below the drinking water standards. The results suggest that the kinetics of Cu leaching were fast and the leachate concentration was relatively low, whereas Cu sorption kinetics were rapid and the sorbed concentrations were significant.

Longline fisheries, oil spills, and offshore wind farms are some of the major threats increasing seabird mortality at sea, but the impact of these threats on specific populations has been difficult to determine so far. We tested the use of molecular markers, morphometric measures, and stable isotope (delta15N and delta13C) and trace element concentrations in the first primary feather (grown at the end of the breeding period) to assign the geographic origin of Calonectris shearwaters. Overall, we sampled birds from three taxa: 13 Mediterranean Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea diomedea) breeding sites, 10 Atlantic Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis) breeding sites, and one Cape Verde Shearwater (C. edwardsii) breeding site. Assignment rates were investigated at three spatial scales: breeding colony, breeding archipelago, and taxa levels. Genetic analyses based on the mitochondrial control region (198 birds from 21 breeding colonies) correctly assigned 100% of birds to the three main taxa but failed in detecting geographic structuring at lower scales. Discriminant analyses based on trace elements composition achieved the best rate of correct assignment to colony (77.5%). Body measurements or stable isotopes mainly succeeded in assigning individuals among taxa (87.9% and 89.9%, respectively) but failed at the colony level (27.1% and 38.0%, respectively). Combining all three approaches (morphometrics, isotopes, and trace elements on 186 birds from 15 breeding colonies) substantially improved correct classifications (86.0%, 90.7%, and 100% among colonies, archipelagos, and taxa, respectively). Validations using two independent data sets and jackknife cross-validation confirmed the robustness of the combined approach in the colony assignment (62.5%, 58.8%, and 69.8% for each validation test, respectively). A preliminary application of the discriminant model based on stable isotope delta15N and delta13C values and trace elements (219 birds from 17 breeding sites) showed that 41 Cory's Shearwaters caught by western Mediterranean long-liners came mainly from breeding colonies in Menorca (48.8%), Ibiza (14.6%), and Crete (31.7%). Our findings show that combining analyses of trace elements and stable isotopes on feathers can achieve high rates of correct geographic assignment of birds in the marine environment, opening new prospects for the study of seabird mortality at sea.

The oxidative stability of extra virgin olive oils (EVOO) from the Greek island of Crete was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and the spin trapping technique. The spin trap N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) was added to the olive oil samples and the production of free radicals was monitored during heating at 70 degrees C. Induction time for the accelerated oxidation of virgin olive oils at 70 degrees C was determined. The EPR results were compared with the oxidative stability values provided by the Rancimat method at 110 degrees C and high linear correlations were found (r=0.922). EPR spin trapping provides a sensitive and rapid method for evaluating the oxidative stability of EVOO. The same samples of Greek extra virgin olive oils were also examined for their radical scavenging activity (RSA) toward the stable galvinoxyl radical by EPR spectroscopy. The decrease of the intensity of the EPR signal upon incubation time was followed. Both oxidative stability and radical scavenging activity of EVOO samples were correlated to their content in polyphenols and tocopherols.

Efforts by scientists to locate the sources of copper used in ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern cultures through comparative chemical analyses of copper ores and archeological artifacts have largely failed for various mineralogical and metallurgical reasons. The isotopic composition of lead, an element present in a minor amount in many copper ores and bronze objects, is unchanged through metallurgical processes and may in principle be used to determine the sources of the copper used in Bronze Age artifacts. Results suggest that for Late Bronze Age Crete the Laurion region in Attica, Greece, may have been a more important copper source than Cyprus.

"We evaluated the association between coffee drinking and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in elderly people from the Mediterranean islands. During 2005-2007, 500 men and 437 women (aged 65 to 100 years) from the islands of Cyprus (n = 300), Mitilini (n = 142), Samothraki (n = 100), Cephalonia (n = 104), Corfu (n = 160) and Crete (n = 131) participated in the survey. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (i.e. hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and obesity), as well as behavioral, lifestyle and dietary characteristics were assessed using face-to-face interviews and standard procedures. Among various factors, fasting blood glucose was measured and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was estimated, according to the established American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, while all participants were asked about the frequency of any type of coffee consumption over the last year. Coffee drinking was reported by 84% of the participants, the majority of whom drank boiled coffee. The participants reported that they had consumed coffee for at least 30 years of their life. Data analysis adjusted for various potential confounders, revealed that, compared to non-consumption, the multi-adjusted odds ratio for having diabetes was 0.47 (95%, CI 0.32 to 0.69) for 1-2 cups/day, while it was 1.05 (95%, CI 0.70 to 1.55) for &gt;3 cups/day, after adjusting for various potential confounders. The association of coffee drinking with diabetes was significant only among non-tea drinkers. Increased coffee intake was not associated with diabetes prevalence. The data presented suggest that moderate coffee drinking is associated with a lower likelihood of having diabetes, after adjusting for various potential confounders."

The aim of this work was to develop a simple and fast analytical method for the determination of a wide range of organic compounds (volatile and semivolatile compounds) in municipal wastewater. The headspace-solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography (with mass spectroscopy) was used for determination of the organic compounds. In this study, 39 organic compounds were determined, including 3 sulfur compounds, 28 substituted benzenes, and 8 substituted phenols. The extraction parameters, such as types of SPME fiber, extraction temperature, extraction time, desorption time, salt effect, and magnetic stirring, were investigated. The method had very good repeatability, because the relative standard deviations ranged from 0.5 to 12%. The detection limit of each compound was at or below the microgram-per-liter level. This method was applied for determination of the organic compounds in raw wastewater, primary effluent, secondary effluent, and chlorinated secondary effluent samples from the Chania Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant (Crete, Greece).

"Thyme honey is the most appreciated unifloral Greek honey in Greece as well as around the world. In an effort to investigate the headspace composition of this type of honey, 28 samples were analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction coupled to a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system. The botanical origin of the samples was ascertained by pollen analysis, and samples displayed relative frequencies of thyme pollen between 18 and 41%. A total of 62 compounds were isolated, and phenylacetaldehyde was the most abundant (32.9% of the total peak area). Possible botanical markers are 1-phenyl-2,3-butanedione (13.4%), 3-hydroxy-4-phenyl-2-butanone, 3-hydroxy-1-phenyl-2-butanone (14.7%), phenylacetonitrile (4.8%), and carvacrol (0.9%), since these compounds are found only in thyme honey. Additionally, high proportions of phenylacetaldehyde are also characteristic ( F = 12.282, p &lt; 0.001). The average concentrations of seven compounds were significantly different ( p &lt; 0.05), namely phenylacetaldehyde, acetophenone, octanoic acid, carvacrol, phenylethyl alcohol, nonanal, and hexadecane. Applying principal component analysis to the data, six components were extracted, explaining 85.4% of the total variance. The first component explained 46.2% of the total variance and was positively correlated to phenylacetaldehyde, nonanoic acid, acetophenone, decanoic acid, benzaldehyde, phenylacetonitrile, isophorone, and nonanal. The extracted components were used as variables to the discriminant analysis, which showed good discrimination, especially for samples from Crete. A leave-one-out classification showed 85.7% of cross-validated grouped cases correctly classified. These results are promising to establish a discrimination model for these geographical regions. This is crucial for local beekeeper corporations on their effort to produce honey with geographical origin label."

"Embodiment of biomass combustion technologies in the Cretan energy system will play an important role and will contribute to the local development. The main biomass fuels of Crete are the agricultural residues olive kernel and olive tree wood. Future applications of these biofuels may create, among others, operational problems related to ash effects. In this regard, the thermal behavior of the ashes during lab-scale fluidized bed combustion tests was examined, in terms of slagging/fouling and agglomeration of bed material. Control methodologies for mitigating ash problems were applied, such as leaching the raw fuels with water and using different mineral additives during combustion. The ashes and the bed material were characterized in terms of mineralogical, chemical and morphological analyses and the slagging/fouling and agglomeration propensities were determined. The results showed that fly ashes were rich in Ca, Si and Fe minerals and contained substantial amounts of alkali, falling within the range of ""certain or probable slagging/fouling"". Leaching of the raw fuels with water resulted in a significant reduction of the problematic elements K, Na, Cl and S in the fly ashes. The use of fuel additives decreased the concentrations of alkali and iron minerals in the fly ashes. With clay additives calcium compounds were enriched in the bottom ash, while with carbonate additives they were enriched in the fly ash. Fuel additives or water leaching reduced the slagging/fouling potential due to alkali. Under the conditions of the combustion tests, no signs of ash deposition or bed agglomeration were noticed. "

"The objective of the present study was to investigate the diversity of mycobacterial isolates in a general hospital in Crete, Greece. 48 positive Lowenstein-Jensen cultures over a 3-y period were analysed by means of AccuProbe and GenoType assays. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) comprised the majority of the isolates (56.3%, 27/48) vs 33.3% (16/48) of M. tuberculosis; 10.4% of the isolates could not be classified. Among NTM, M. lentiflavum was the predominant species isolated (9/27) followed by M. kansasii, M. gordonae and M. peregrinum, whereas no M. avium complex isolates were detected. This is the first detection of M. lentiflavum in Greece. The susceptibilities of the M. lentiflavum isolates to an extended panel of antibiotics were determined by the proportions method and the medical files of the 9 patients were reviewed. Three isolates were from urine, which is an unusual site. All strains exhibited multidrug resistance. The patients were adults with immunosuppression or predisposing conditions for NTM infection. Diagnosis of true infection was either not pursued or the patients died shortly after isolation."

"Carbapenems are frequently used to treat infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Thus, the emergence of infections due to carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKp) is a major public health concern. To identify risk factors associated with the development of CRKp infections. We conducted a matched case-control study in two hospitals (Henry Dunant Hospital, Athens, Greece and University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece). The controls were selected among patients with carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CSKp) and were matched with CRKp cases for site of infection. One hundred and six patients were included in our study (53 cases and 53 controls). Mortality was 30.1% and 33.9% for patients with CRKp and CSKp infections, respectively (P = 0.83). Bivariable analysis showed that exposure to anti-pseudomonas penicillins (P = 0.004), carbapenems (P = 0.01), quinolones (P &lt; 0.001) and glycopeptides (P &lt; 0.001), as well as admission to the intensive care unit (P = 0.002), tracheostomy (P = 0.02), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.04), surgery with use of foreign body (P = 0.04) and mechanical ventilation (P = 0.02) were associated with CRKp infection. The multivariable analysis showed that exposure to fluoroquinolones [odds ratio (OR) 4.54, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 1.78-11.54, P = 0.001] and exposure to antipseudomonal penicillins (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.00-6.71, P = 0.04) were independent risk factors for CRKp infections. Our data suggest that prior exposure to fluoroquinolones and antipseudomonal penicillins are independent risk factors for the development of CRKp infections."

The contents of (pseudo)hypericin and their immediate precursors were studied in wild populations of various Hypericum species on the island of Crete, Greece. Therefore, the aerial parts of wild grown H. perforatum, H. triquentrifolium, H. empetrifolium and H. perfoliatum shoots were collected throughout the island and the quantitative variations in (proto)hypericin and (proto)pseudohypericin examined. The plant material was harvested at different stages of the life cycle of the species and the contents in the above-mentioned compounds analyzed discriminating between flowers/fruits and leaves/petioles. HPLC analysis of hypericin, pseudohypericin and their immediate precursors, protohypericin and protopseudohypericin, revealed great differences in the contents of the compounds in dependence on the developmental stage of the plants. In all examined species the highest concentrations of hypericin were found during blossoming whereas the lowest concentrations were present during ripening of the fruits. H. perforatum and H. triquentrifolium show much higher hypericin levels in flowers/fruits compared to leaves/petioles, whereas the species H. empetrifolium and H. perfoliatum show similar concentrations of total hypericins in both flowers/fruits and leaves/petioles. In the different species the levels of (proto)hypericin and (proto)pseudohypericin varied, but in almost all samples from flowers/fruits and leaves/petioles the ratio of (proto)hypericin to (proto)pseudohypericin was higher than one. When the total amount of hypericins per entire aerial part of a plant was calculated for all developmental stages, we found that H. perforatum contained the highest amount of hypericin. This in combination with the comparatively high concentration of hypericins in flowers/fruits and in leaves/petioles in this species, as well as the high ratio of (proto)hypericin to (proto)pseudohypericin, especially during the developmental stage of blossoming, encourages us to think about the possibility of cultivating Hypericum perforatum in Crete as a medicinal plant in the future.

Five organic Sloping and Mountainous Olive Plantation Production Systems (SMOPS) have been studied in four olive-producing areas in four European countries (Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal). Results indicate that these SMOPS provide ecological, economic and social benefits to the regions in which they are located, although most of these benefits are not strictly limited to the organic production systems. Erosion control and organic matter balance remain significant issues in four of the SMOPS and we suggest that subsidy support should be conditional on the implementation of additional soil and water conservation measures that should be provided with specific funding. Most of the SMOPS will remain dependent on a similar level of support in order for olive production to remain economically feasible. The lower profitability compared to non-organic olive production systems suggests that there is limited scope for expansion of organic olive production, although in the study areas where there is little such production, such as Western Crete (Greece) and Basilicata-Salerno (Italy) the scope remains great. The analysis of the reasons for the beneficial effects of olive cultivation in the areas studied indicates that in most cases soil management techniques adopted in or recommended for organic production systems could provide similar benefits in other production systems as well.

"The risk of epidemics and emerging or re-emerging diseases such as avian flu, tuberculosis, malaria and other vector-borne diseases, is rising. These risks can be contained with prevention, early warning, and prompt management. Despite progress in information technology, communication is still a bottleneck for health early warning and response systems in post-disaster situations. This paper presents Satellites for Epidemiology (SAFE), a component-based interoperable architecture for health early warning that employs satellite, radio, and wireless networks, geographic information systems, integration technology, and data mining to promptly identify and respond to a disease outbreak. In a post-disaster situation, a mobile health emergency coordination center is established and integrated to public health services for health monitoring. The added-value of SAFE for post-disaster health management will be demonstrated as part of an earthquake readiness exercise regarding a typhoid fever epidemic, in the island of Crete. Advanced communication and data mining techniques in SAFE offer new tools to the ""Epidemic Intelligence"" and contribute to advanced preparedness and prompt response by lifting communication barriers, promoting collaboration, and reducing the isolation of affected areas.

There is intensive cultivation of olives on sloping land in Jaen-Granada (Spain), Basilicata (Italy) and Western Crete (Greece). The intensive olive groves here are characterised by a tree density of about 250treesha(-1), yearly fertilisation and pruning, several chemical sprays for pest control, soil tillage once to thrice per year and irrigation up to 2700m3ha(-1)yr(-1). Intensive management results in high yields of 3600-6500kgha(-1) but also higher labour costs of 1154-1590euroha(-1)yr(-1), varying per area. The major environmental concerns in this system are related to chemical residues in the fruit, the extinction of useful insects, the depletion of groundwater resources, the pollution of soil and water and the erosion of soil. This paper describes the impact of intensive orchard management on natural resources and gives recommendations for soil and water conservation, reduction of chemicals use and biodiversity enhancement. The specific recommendations for the relevant stakeholders--farmers, technicians, agricultural services and policy makers--are based on the experimental evaluation of different agricultural practices and a socio-economic analysis of local and global production and markets.
PMID:17923250	Duarte F, Jones N, Fleskens L	J Environ Manage. 89(2):86-98	2008	Traditional olive orchards on sloping land: sustainability or abandonment? 	Traditional olive orchards account for a large share of the area under olives in the EU, particularly in marginal areas, like those analysed in the OLIVERO project. In general, traditional olive growing can be described as a low-intensity production system, associated with old (sometimes very old) trees, grown at a low density, giving small yields and receiving low inputs of labour and materials. Though such systems are environmentally sustainable, their economic viability has become an issue, since EU policies favour more intensive and competitive systems. Orchards that have not been intensified seem to be threatened by the recent reform of the EU olive and olive oil policy, as income support has been decoupled from production. The main purpose of this paper is to identify the present constraints to traditional olive growing, and to recommend some private and public interventions to prevent its abandonment. During the OLIVERO project, traditional olive production systems were identified and described in five target areas (Trás-os-Montes--Portugal, Cordoba and Granada/Jaen--Spain, Basilicata/Salerno--Italy, and West Crete--Greece). The causes and consequences of abandonment are discussed, based on the analysis of the costs and returns, which revealed that these systems are barely economically sustainable. Their viability is only assured if reduced opportunity costs for family labour are accepted, and the olive growing is part-time. Based on these results, recommendations are made to prevent the abandonment of traditional olive growing and to preserve its environmental benefits.

The objective of this field study was to depict the extensive system of dairy sheep farming in the semi-arid environment of the island of Crete and to assess the potential margins of improvement through technical intervention. Forty-three family-run farms keeping a total of 13,870 sheep were surveyed in seven representative areas of the island. Several parameters were dealt with, concerning socio-economy, flock management and productivity. Study areas differed widely regarding feeds supplied per sheep, land cultivated for feeds, grazing land utilized and housing space. A range of parameters were recorded on flock size and their production characteristics such as births, fertility and number of lambs weaned. Milk yield and parameters associated with milk quality, such as somatic cell counts and total microbial flora, were also recorded. Technical intervention was directed towards removal of non-productive animals, programming of matings, balancing of diets, management of grazing lands and health care. Ewe fertility and numbers of lambs weaned per ewe, as well as harvested milk and milk quality (based on somatic cell counts and microbial load of milk) were also significantly improved. Information derived from this study stresses the important role of extension services to small farm sustainability and contributes to our knowledge of the dairy sheep farming systems in countries around the Mediterranean and elsewhere.

Epidemiological studies concerning dermatophyte infections have been performed in many countries and differences in the incidence and the aetiological agents have been reported in different geographical locations. This study was undertaken to investigate the prevailing species of dermatophytes in the island of Crete, Greece, and their pattern of infection during a 7-year period (1997-2003). A total of 5544 samples obtained from 3751 patients with clinically suspected dermatomycoses were examined mycologically in the laboratory of Clinical Microbiology at the University Hospital of Crete, Greece. Skin, hair and nail specimens were subjected to direct microscopy and culture. Dermatophytes were isolated from 520 patients (13.9%). Trichophyton rubrum was the most frequently isolated dermatophyte accounting for 48% of the infections, followed by Microsporum canis (17.9%), Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. interdigitale (14.2%) and Epidermophyton floccosum (6%). Tinea unguium, tinea pedis, tinea corporis, tinea capitis, tinea cruris, tinea manuum and tinea facei were the clinical types of dermatophytoses in decreasing order of frequency. Trichophyton rubrum is the predominant dermatophyte in our area. As the epidemiology of dermatophytoses is changing over time it is important to review periodically the incidence of dermatophytes and their distribution.

Nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite markers were used to study population structure and gene flow among seven Cretan populations of the Aegean endemic plant species Brassica cretica (Brassicaceae). Both nuclear and chloroplast markers revealed exceptionally high levels of population differentiation (overall F(ST)=0.628 and 1.000, respectively) and relatively little within-population diversity (overall H(S)=0.211 and 0.000, respectively). Maximum-likelihood estimates of directional migration rates were low among all pairs of populations (average Nm=0.286). There was no evidence that differences in flower colour between populations had any influence on historical levels of gene flow. In addition, a haplotype network showed that all five chloroplast haplotypes found in the sample were closely related. Together, these results suggest that current patterns of diversification in B. cretica are mainly a result of genetic drift during the last half million years. The main conclusions from the present study are consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that plant diversification in the Aegean region is driven by random rather than adaptive differentiation among isolated populations.

"Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a major threat to public health. Greece, having the highest smoking prevalence in the European Union is seriously affected by passive smoking. The purpose of this study was to measure environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in the non smoking areas of hospitality venues and offices in Greece and to compare the levels of exposure to levels in the US, UK and Ireland before and after the implementation of a smoking ban. Experimental measurements of particulate matter 2.5 microm (PM2.5), performed during a cross sectional study of 49 hospitality venues and offices in Athens and Crete, Greece during February - March 2006. Levels of ETS ranged from 19 microg/m3 to 612 microg/m3, differing according to the place of measurement. The average exposure in hospitality venues was 268 microg/m3 with ETS levels found to be highest in restaurants with a mean value of 298 microg/m3 followed by bars and cafes with 271 microg/m3. ETS levels were 76% lower in venues in which smoking was not observed compared to all other venues (p &lt; 0.001). ETS levels in Greek designated non-smoking areas are similar to those found in the smoking sections of UK hospitality venues while levels in Ireland with a total smoking ban are 89% lower and smoke-free communities in the US are 91 - 96% lower than levels in Greece. Designated non-smoking areas of hospitality venues in Greece are significantly more polluted with ETS than outdoor air and similar venues in Europe and the United States. The implementation of a total indoor smoking ban in hospitality venues has been shown to have a positive effect on workers and patrons' health. The necessity of such legislation in Greece is thus warranted."

Nitric oxide (NO), a short-lived gaseous free radical, synthesized from L-arginine by NO synthases (NOS), is a potent mediator of biologic responses involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Most biological necessary NO is produced by the family of three NOS. To date, several functionally relevant genetic polymorphisms in the eNOS gene have been associated with various vascular, infectious and autoimmune diseases. To our knowledge, no study has explored these polymorphisms for both SLE and RA in the same population. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the eNOS gene intron 4 a/b VNTR polymorphism (a 27-base-pair tandem repeat-based polymorphism) on susceptibility to SLE and RA in patients living in the island of Crete, a genetically homogeneous population. A group of 145 healthy subjects and 190 SLE patients were included in this study. Similarly, a second group of 235 healthy controls and 202 RA patients were analysed. In both cases, patients and controls were sex- and age-matched. Herein we report that the presence of a/b genotype of the eNOS gene may act as a risk factor not for the presence of SLE but for the development of glomerulonephritis (OR 2.71, 95% CI: 1.4-5.2), while it may be a susceptibility gene for RA (OR: 2.005, 95% CI: 1.31-3.07). Thus, in our population, the a/b genotype of the eNOS gene represents a severity rather than a susceptibility genotype for SLE.

"In the present work we assessed chronic exposure of different working population groups of Messara and Sitia districts, Crete, Greece, to common currently used pesticides (diazinon, fenthion, methyl parathion and malathion) and two banned pesticides hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and DDT. The study population (211 persons, 110 females and 101 males) was divided to three groups; people working in greenhouses, animal breeders and people working in open cultivations. Methanolic extraction of pulverized hair was used for organophosphate pesticides extraction, followed by liquid-liquid extraction with water-ethyl acetate as a clean up step. The extraction of organochlorine pollutants was performed by acidic hydrolysis of the hair matrix followed by liquid-liquid and solid phase extraction. The levels of the aforementioned pesticides were measured by GC-ECD and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The median concentrations of a-HCH, HCB, lindane, opDDE, ppDDE, opDDD, ppDDD + opDDT and ppDDT were determined at 7.2, 2.2, 70.2, 2.7, 5.7, 3.1, 2.6 and 23.2 pg/mg. The median concentration of total HCHs and DDTs detected in the three working groups were: 95.0 and 8.9 pg/mg for the greenhouse workers, 38.2 and 3.3 pg/mg for the animal breeders and 24.1 and 5.2 pg/mg for the open cultivation group. Ten head hair samples were positive for diazinon at a mean concentration of 2.8 pg/mg. Fenthion, methyl parathion and malathion were not detected. Our results demonstrated the ability to assess chronic human past pesticides exposure, offering valuable information to epidemiological clinical studies."

Ten years after primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare facilities in Crete were connected in HYGEIAnet, one of the first regional health information networks worldwide, the Twister project addressed the practical challenge of delivering integrated eHealth services to remote healthcare facilities in Crete and the south Aegean. A hybrid network infrastructure comprising terrestrial broadband, wireless, and satellite segments provided connectivity among distributed healthcare organizations. A fast-track methodology of continuous training and evaluation was used to encourage the wide adoption of EHR services in primary healthcare centers and their remote community offices, eTraining in prehospital emergency management, and medical collaboration. For the evaluation of Twister, health professionals using EHRs and citizens visiting the healthcare facilities provided their attitudes and perceptions on eHealth. Although eHealth is viewed differently by citizens and health professionals, both groups consider the EHR as an important part of the daily medical practice. However, continuous training, practical incentives, and awareness initiatives are necessary to increase the use of EHRs and the social embedding of eHealth in rural areas.

"Studies have shown that depression relates to biomarkers of both short-term and long-term polyunsaturated fatty acid intake. However, it is not known which of these two biomarkers is more closely related to depression. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of depression with both adipose tissue and serum phospholipid polyunsaturated fatty acids and to assess the importance of each of these two biomarkers in relating to depression. This is a cross-sectional study of healthy adults from the island of Crete. Subjects were examined by the Preventive Medicine and Nutrition Clinic of the University of Crete. Subjects were 394 healthy adults (175 males, 219 females) aged 18-60. The sample consisted of farmers from a number of rural communities of Crete. Fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography in adipose tissue and serum phospholipids. Information about depression was obtained through the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSRDS). Adipose tissue alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (C18:3n-3) was inversely correlated to BDI (r=-0.17, p&lt;0.02). Multiple linear regression analysis taking into account the possible confounding effect of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking and educational level did not confirm this association. The other polyunsaturated fatty acids in adipose tissue were not related to depression. Serum phospholipid polyunsaturated fatty acids did not correlate with depression. This study did not show that the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the adipose tissue are better predictors of depression than those in serum phospholipids."

"It has been proposed that insulin resistance (IR) is associated with the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of IR in Greek schoolchildren and to investigate factors associated with IR. Between October 2005 and March 2006, 522 children were recruited from Crete. Physical activity and dietary habits, anthropometric and biochemical characteristics, as well as medical history of pupils' parents were recorded. IR was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio (FGIR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). Multiple linear regression was used to determine independent predictors for IR. Fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR scores were higher in obese children and girls compared with their normal-weight peers (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the former had lower values in FGIR and QUICKI indices compared with the latter, indicating that obese children and girls are more insulin resistant compared with their counterparts (P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of IR was 9.2% (2.9% in normal-weight, 10.5% in overweight and 31.0% in obese children), using as a threshold HOMA-IR &gt; 2.10 97.5th percentile of normal-weight participants). Multiple linear regression revealed that central adiposity, female gender and intake of simple carbohydrates is associated positively with HOMA-IR values, even after controlling for many other factors. These findings demonstrate that girls and obese children, particularly those with central adiposity, are at high risk of developing IR. Therefore, these groups should be targets of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease preventive interventions."

"Myocardin is thought to contribute to heart hypertrophy as assessed in animal models. The aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms on the myocardin gene and investigate possible relationships with left ventricular structure in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Eighty-four native Cretan individuals (36 patients with HCM and 48 healthy controls) were examined by direct sequencing and subsequent restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and six polymorphisms were identified in the promoter region at positions -435T&gt;C (rs758187), -629A&gt;T (rs8071072), -1030C&gt;G (rs1233851), -1069A&gt;G, -1166A&gt;G and -1406G&gt;A (rs976906). Allele and haplotype frequencies were not significantly different between patients and controls. However, patients carrying the [-435C;-629T] allelic variant had decreased left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT, p = 0.020) and left ventricular mass (p = 0.006) as compared with the wild-type genotype. Carrier status of this myocardin promoter allelic variant was also associated with significant lower myocardin mRNA levels in peripheral blood (p = 0.039). Thus, a myocardin promoter allelic variant existing in the normal Cretan population was associated with decreased left ventricular mass in HCM patients and decreased myocardin mRNA levels in peripheral blood. Our results may be limited by the limited sample size, but are strengthened by the genetic homogeneity of the Cretan population. Our data suggest that functional natural myocardin promoter variation might be a genetic factor contributing to inter-individual differences in the development of cardiac hypertrophy."

"Crete has been of great epidemiological interest ever since the publication of the Seven Countries Study. In 1988 a well-defined area of rural Crete was studied, with only scarce signs of coronary heart disease (CHD) despite the unfavorable risk profile. The same population was re-examined twelve years later aiming to describe the trends of CHD risk factors over time and discuss some key points on the natural course of coronary heart disease in a rural population of Crete. We re-examined 200 subjects (80.7% of those still living in the area, 62.4 +/- 17.0 years old). The prevalence of risk factors for CHD was high with 65.9% of men and 65.1% of women being hypertensive, 14.3% of men and 16.5% of women being diabetic, 44% of men being active smokers and more than 40% of both sexes having hyperlipidaemia. Accordingly, 77.5% of the population had a calculated Framingham Risk Score (FRS) &gt; or = 15%, significantly higher compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.001). The overall occurrence rate for CHD events was calculated at 7.1 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval: 6.8-7.3). The study confirms the unfavorable risk factor profile of a well defined rural population in Crete. Its actual effect on the observed incidence of coronary events in Cretans remains yet to be defined."

"To assess the Ca, nutrient and food intake of Greek Orthodox Christian monks during a vegetarian-type fasting week, compared with their normal diet. Dietary data collection (using 7 d weighed food records), anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, as well as serum glucose and lipid analyses, were performed during Palm Sunday week (fasting) and the week following Pentecost Sunday (non-fasting). Mean daily nutrient and food (g/d) intakes were calculated from the food records. The study took place in two monasteries in the Municipality of Heraklion, Crete. The study involved ten healthy monks aged 25-65 years, with BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2, who had been performing fasts for the last 24.4 (SD 10.4) years and lived in monasteries in Crete during April-June 2005. Nutrient and food intake profiles were more favourable during the fasting week, when participants had lower intakes of total and saturated fat and trans-fatty acids, and higher intakes of dietary fibre, Fe, folate, legumes and fish/seafood. Ca intake was lower when participants fasted, whereas consumption of dairy products, meat and eggs increased significantly in the non-fasting week. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher, whereas blood lipid levels were more favourable during the fasting week. The periodic vegetarianism recommended by the Greek Orthodox Church contributes to the favourable profiles of several biomarkers of health among this sample of monks. The fasting rituals described are an important component of the traditional diet of Crete and should be emphasised in nutrition education programmes promoting this Mediterranean eating pattern."

Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autosomal, recessively inherited disease, characterized by recurrent and short attacks of fever with serosal inflammation that are caused by mutations in MEFV gene that encodes pyrin protein. To date, more than 70 disease-associated mutations have been identified, almost all of them representing missense nucleotide changes. FMF is very common among patients with Mediterranean ancestry, although the exact prevalence is not yet known, Greeks are considered to be at 'intermediate risk'. In the present study, we studied FMF patients in natives of Crete, a population sharing a common genetic and cultural background. The spectrum of MEFV gene mutations in 71 patients as well as 158 healthy controls was studied by performing a molecular analysis focused on the 12 most frequent FMF-associated mutations. We found that 59 of 71 (83.1%) FMF patients had at least one MEFV mutation, five patients were homozygotes and 54 heterozygotes for FMF-associated mutations. No mutations were detected in 12 patients (16.9%). As in high-risk populations, common MEFV mutations were found in Cretan FMF patients, with the M694V being the most penetrant. M694V and M694I mutations were associated with severe phenotypes, with many patients presenting with uncommon clinical manifestations such as erysipelas-like erythema or renal disturbances. Of interest, 20 (37%) of our heterozygous FMF patients presented with a severe phenotype. Population genetics analysis showed an FMF carrier frequency in healthy Cretan population of approximately 6% (1:17) and places Cretans closer to the Western rather than Eastern populations of the Mediterranean basin. Finally, we constructed a three-dimensional model showing the interaction of the PRYSPRY domain of pyrin with caspase-1 onto which we mapped MEFV mutations, classified according to disease severity. In this model, the 'flexible loops' of caspase-1 appear to have no access to some positions that have been previously associated with mild disease, suggesting that alternative pathogenic pathways leading to FMF need to be explored.

The hydrologic and geochemical conditions that prevail in Mediterranean temporary ponds (MTPs), create a unique environment for many rare and endangered species. Mediterranean temporary ponds are habitats of high ecological value, which are vulnerable to imminent climatic changes, as well as to human activities. This article examines the hydrology and the nitrogen and phosphorous geochemical cycles of four MTPs in Crete. Field and laboratory studies provided the necessary information for the development of a conceptual understanding of the hydrologic and biogeochemical processes that affect the fate of nitrogen and phosphorous in these MTPs. Their hydrology was driven by deposition, infiltration, and evaporation. The hydroperiod of the ponds varied between 40 and 160 d. Mineralization and nutrient release capacity experiments illustrated the significant role that MTP sediments played in enhancing the geochemistry of the aqueous phase. Such ecosystem functions (i.e., mineralization, nutrient release) exhibited high variability among MTPs necessitating site-specific studies with immediate implications to management. It is very important to understand the local hydrogeochemical and climatic conditions to ensure appropriate environmental measures for their management and conservation.

"To improve our understanding of the formation and fate of nitro-PAHs, which contribute to the toxicity of ambient particles, the diurnal variation of their ambient concentration was studied concurrently with the corresponding PAH, OH radical, ozone, and oxy-PAH concentration, during an intensive field campaign at an eastern Mediterranean marine background location (Finokalia, Island of Crete) in August, 2001. The gas-phase PAH and OH radical concentrations maximized at noon. Gas-phase PAH concentrations were correlated (p &lt; 0.001) with ambient temperatures. The gas-phase OH-radical-initiated PAH reaction was identified as the major process contributing to the ambient burden of nitro-PAHs. 2-Nitrofluoranthene and 2-nitropyrene were the most abundant particle-associated nitro-PAHs. A well-defined diurnal pattern was identified for both compounds exhibiting a maximum during midday followed by a rapid decrease. 9,10-Anthracenodione and 9-fluorenone, the most abundant oxy-PAHs, did not present a diurnal variation of concentration."

The objective of this work was to evaluate the diagnosis and management of patients with substernal goiter (SSG) on the basis of our experience. We conducted a retrospective study of all SSGs within a series of 591 thyroidectomies performed in a tertiary referral center over a period of 14 years, analyzing epidemiological data, diagnostic criteria, and surgical results. There were 37 (6%) patients with descending goiter: 28 women (mean age 57.1 years) and 9 men (mean age 61 years). All 37 patients underwent successful surgical treatment without any major postoperative complications. A postoperative histological examination revealed a 16.6% incidence of malignancy. Despite the size and close proximity to vital organs in the mediastinum, all of the SSGs were managed successfully. A neck approach was used in all except for one patient who was operated on via sternotomy. A thorough preoperative evaluation including computed tomography scan of the neck and mediastinum, and an appropriate surgical technique ensure a positive outcome for most patients with an SSG.

Four yeast strains were isolated from Spanish traditional fermented sausages (chorizo) spoiled by gas production. Using the classical identification procedures, they were identified as Debaryomyces hansenii. However, they fermented galactose and did not produce positive results in Debaryomyces differential medium (DDM), a growth medium highly specific for this species. Phylogenetic analysis showed identical sequences for the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene and almost identical sequences for the 5.8S-ITS region with those of the recently described yeast species Candida cretensis. This result was confirmed by sequencing the gene encoding actin of the type and the new strains. Candida cretensis is a new species included in the so-called Candida kruisii clade that was described from a single strain, isolated from a decaying mushroom in Crete, Greece. The discovery of new strains of C. cretensis in fermented food expands its physiological and ecological diversity. With the description of these new strains isolated from food, three groups of strains can be distinguished within C. cretensis according to the restriction patterns of the intergenic spacer rRNA gene region and on the basis of some physiological properties that are of ecological relevance.

"The earliest Neolithic sites of Europe are located in Crete and mainland Greece. A debate persists concerning whether these farmers originated in neighboring Anatolia and the role of maritime colonization. To address these issues 171 samples were collected from areas near three known early Neolithic settlements in Greece together with 193 samples from Crete. An analysis of Y-chromosome haplogroups determined that the samples from the Greek Neolithic sites showed strong affinity to Balkan data, while Crete shows affinity with central/Mediterranean Anatolia. Haplogroup J2b-M12 was frequent in Thessaly and Greek Macedonia while haplogroup J2a-M410 was scarce. Alternatively, Crete, like Anatolia showed a high frequency of J2a-M410 and a low frequency of J2b-M12. This dichotomy parallels archaeobotanical evidence, specifically that while bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is known from Neolithic Anatolia, Crete and southern Italy; it is absent from earliest Neolithic Greece. The expansion time of YSTR variation for haplogroup E3b1a2-V13, in the Peloponnese was consistent with an indigenous Mesolithic presence. In turn, two distinctive haplogroups, J2a1h-M319 and J2a1b1-M92, have demographic properties consistent with Bronze Age expansions in Crete, arguably from NW/W Anatolia and Syro-Palestine, while a later mainland (Mycenaean) contribution to Crete is indicated by relative frequencies of V13."

"The classical biological control program for exotic saltcedars (various Tamarix species and hybrids) has involved the assessment of different populations of the leaf beetle Diorhabda elongata (Brullé) s.l. that are promising for release in areas of North America that are located south of 37 degrees N latitude. We report here the overwintering survival, phenology, and voltinism of four D. elongata populations (Tunisia, Crete, Uzbekistan, and Turpan) in eastcentral Texas. In addition, we studied their developmental and reproductive biology, which also included the previously released population from Fukang, China. Overwintering survival of the adult beetles of the Crete and Tunisia populations was 90-99 and 75%, respectively. The Uzbekistan and Turpan beetles had &lt;31% overwintering survival. All D. elongata populations began ovipositing in late March. The Turpan beetle may produce three summer generations and ceased oviposition by September. The Crete beetle produced four summer generations plus a partial fifth generation and ceased ovipositing by mid-October. Both the Tunisia and Uzbekistan beetles produced five summer generations plus an unsuccessful partial sixth generation; oviposition extended into late November. Larval development and survival were generally similar among D. elongata populations. The Turpan and Fukang beetles had a shorter preoviposition period and produced more but smaller egg masses than the other beetle populations. However, this did not alter a female's lifetime fecundity and generally did not affect the innate capacity for increase compared with other populations. The Crete beetle seems to be the most promising for release in central Texas and points further south."

"Mitochondrial complex I deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), but as yet no mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations have been identified that could account for the impaired complex I activity. On the other hand, it has been suggested that mtDNA polymorphisms (mtSNPs) or haplogroups may modify the risk of developing PD. Here, we determined the distributions of ten mtSNPs that define the nine major European haplogroups among 224 PD patients and 383 controls from Crete, an island of 0.6 million inhabitants who share a similar genetic background and a common environment. The recruitment of patients and controls was restricted to individuals of Cretan origin for at least three generations from both parental sides in order to avoid population admixture and subsequent genetic heterogeneity. We found no mtSNP or mtDNA haplogroup that predisposes to PD, although there was a trend for haplogroups J, T, U and I and the supercluster of haplogroups UKJT to be slightly underrepresented in our PD patients as compared to controls. While a combination of common mtSNPs (present in &gt;or=5% of the general population) may decrease the chance of developing PD, this effect was minor in the Cretan population."

Due to inappropriate agricultural management practices, soil erosion is becoming one of the most dangerous forms of soil degradation in many olive farming areas in the Mediterranean region, leading to significant decrease of soil fertility and yield. In order to prevent further soil degradation, proper measures are necessary to be locally implemented. In this perspective, an increase in the spatial accuracy of remote sensing datasets and advanced image analysis are significant tools necessary and efficient for mapping soil erosion risk on a fine scale. In this study, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was implemented in the spatial domain using GIS, while a very high resolution satellite image, namely a QuickBird image, was used for deriving cover management (C) and support practice (P) factors, in order to map the risk of soil erosion in Kolymvari, a typical olive farming area in the island of Crete, Greece. The results comprised a risk map of soil erosion when P factor was taken uniform (conventional approach) and a risk map when P factor was quantified site-specifically using object-oriented image analysis. The results showed that the QuickBird image was necessary in order to achieve site-specificity of the P factor and therefore to support fine scale mapping of soil erosion risk in an olive cultivation area, such as the one of Kolymvari in Crete. Increasing the accuracy of the QB image classification will further improve the resulted soil erosion mapping.

Several reports on angioedema (AE) related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have been published recently. This study reports on the experience gained at the Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) Clinic of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete. A retrospective chart review of the patients admitted to this clinic, in a 42-month period (1999-2003), and discharged with a diagnosis ENT code for AE was performed (14 eligible patients). A complementary telephone survey was conducted during January 2005. Ten patients responded to our invitation. Of those patients, five were under ACE-I and one was under ARB treatment during the AE episode. The mean length of time between the onset of symptoms and presentation to the hospital was 4.5 hours (range 0.5-12 hours). The mean duration between the initiation of antihypertensive treatment and AE episode was 26.2 months (range 1-60 months). Patients reported that no information was provided about the possible adverse effects of these drugs. Although AE introduced by ACE-I and ARBs is an uncommon side effect, this case series conveys a key message to primary care physicians.

Laparascopic examination. Statistical methods included chi(2) and Mann-Whitney U tests measuring incidence of right- vs. left-sided endometria. One hundred seventy patients from Yale University and 81 Greek patients participated in this study. Endometrioma was significantly more frequent in the left ovary (139 of 206 [67.4%]) than in the right ovary (67 of 206 [32.6%]; odds ratio [OR] = 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI) 2.9-6.5; chi(2) = 48.9) and significantly different from the expected proportion of 50% (chi(2) = 25.2). When bilateral endometriomas were included, 62.1% (184 of 296) were left-sided and 37.15 (112 of 296) were right-sided (OR = 17.5; 95% CI 1.9-3.8; chi(2) = 34.1). Dilated ovarian veins in were found in 22 (68.7%) of 32 Greek cases with endometrioma. All 20 women with left endometrioma had left ovarian vein dilated. We suggest a new mechanical theory of implication, the female varicocele theory, which could play an important role in the development of ovarian endometriosis or endometriomas."

By numerical simulation we investigate the sensitivity of the method to both atmospheric and device perturbations. The aerosol optical effect in the planetary boundary layer, ozone interference in water-vapor retrieval, statistical error, optical cross talk between Raman-shifted channels, and optical cross talk between an elastically backscattered signal in Raman-shifted signals and an afterpulse effect are studied in detail. In support of the main conclusions of this model study, time series of ozone and water vapor obtained at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne and during a field campaign in Crete are presented. They are compared with point monitor and balloon sounding measurements for daytime and nighttime conditions.

"Two free water surface (FWS) and two subsurface flow (SSF) pilot-size constructed wetlands treating highway runoff (HRO) were monitored over a period of two years (September 2005-August 2007). One FWS and one SSF were designed with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12h, named FWS12 and SSF12, respectively, with each one capable of treating a maximum HRO of 12.6 m(3) d(-1). The other couple, named FWS24 and SSF24, respectively, was designed with an HRT of 24h, with each receiving a maximum HRO of 6.3 m(3) d(-1). The influent flowed from a highway section with a total surface 2752 m(2) on the island of Crete, Greece, in the heart of the South-Central Mediterranean region. Influent and effluent were monitored for COD, TSS, total N (TN), NO(3)(-) and total P (TP) concentrations. Furthermore, removal efficiencies were examined for heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) for both years, while polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs) were examined for the period between September 2006 and August 2007. The influent had a two-year average COD value of 101 mg l(-1), whereas the mean values for TSS, TN, N-NO(3)(-) and TP were 203, 4.30, 1.25 and 4.17 mg l(-1), respectively. For Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn the respective two-year mean influent concentrations were 56, 114, 49 and 250 microg l(-1). Mean concentration of total PAHs in runoff (summation operator PAHs, 16 compounds) were 12.01 microg l(-1). The performance among the four beds was not significantly different according to ANOVA analysis followed by Tukey test (at p&lt;0.05) for almost all the above physicochemical parameters, suggesting that all systems performed in a similar way.

We conducted this study among school adolescents to identify factors, which influence schoolchildren to smoke. We carried out a cross-sectional study in a sample of 924 students of all classes (ages 12-18 years old) in 15 public high schools in a semi-urban area in Crete, Greece, using a questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of 46 questions covering children's lifestyle habits regarding daily activities and leisure time, frequency of risk-taking behaviour, knowledge about the hazards and long-term consequences of smoking. 23.9% of participants were experimental smokers and 18.6% were current smokers. 11.4% of the total population was daily smokers. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of experimental and current smokers with school grades, while peaks in last grades were observed. Boys started smoking earlier than girls, mean (standard error) age 13.4 (2.3) years vs. 14.1 (2.3) years, P = 0.01. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed a positive relationship between current smoking and having brother or sister smoking [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 2.7 (1.7-4.4) and 1.8 (1.1-3.3) respectively], having more than three friends who were smokers [2.6 (2-3.4)] and last school grade [1.4 (1.2-1.7)]. Students appeared to be informed about long-term smoking hazards and had negative views on children who smoke especially in the lower grades. Prevention programmes should be imposed early in elementary schools while cessation policies should target at all grades, in particular at critical grades depending on population-specific characteristics.

"This work deals with the prediction of the geographical origin of monovarietal virgin olive oil (cv. Koroneiki) samples from three regions of southern Greece, namely, Peloponnesus, Crete, and Zakynthos, and collected in five harvesting years (2001-2006). All samples were chemically analyzed by means of 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy and characterized according to their content in fatty acids, phenolics, diacylglycerols, total free sterols, free acidity, and iodine number. Biostatistical analysis showed that the fruiting pattern of the olive tree complicates the geographical separation of oil samples and the selection of significant chemical compounds. In this way the inclusion of the harvesting year improved the classification of samples, but increased the dimensionality of the data. Discriminant analysis showed that the geographical prediction at the level of three regions is very high (87%) and becomes (74%) when we pass to the thinner level of six sites (Chania, Sitia, and Heraklion in Crete; Lakonia and Messinia in Peloponnesus; Zakynthos). The use of classification and binary trees made possible the construction of a geographical prediction algorithm for unknown samples in a self-improvement fashion, which can be readily extended to other varieties and areas."

We report 2 of these cases followed by an investigation of the immune status of the adult Cretan population against tetanus using 200 random patients who visited our clinic. A negative history of complete childhood immunization was recorded in 37% of individuals. Of the male population, 88.5% had received active immunization during adulthood, although 47% had received all three doses. Only 12.6% of the females had received full-dose immunization during adulthood. Overall, only 8.5% of the studied population had received either complete immunization or a scheduled booster dose during the last decade. In many cases, an otorhinolaryngologist can be the first physician to examine a patient with tetanus. The incidence of the disease in Crete, Greece, is significantly higher than in most parts of developed countries.

Earlier studies have suggested altered nitric oxide (NO) metabolism in both T1D and T2D. In the present case-control study, we investigated whether the endothelial NO synthase gene intron 4 a/b polymorphism is associated with T1D and T2D in the island of Crete, a well-defined area with genetically homogeneous population. Mutated allele ""a"" was more common in individuals with both T1D and T2D than in controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-2.77, p = 0.013; and OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.930-2.42, p = 0.047, respectively). Mutated genotype (a/a or a/b) was more common in individuals with T1D than in nondiabetic individuals (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.12-3.32, p = 0.008); this increased frequency was also observed for T2D, although not at a significant level (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.802-2.37). No difference was found in the frequency of mutated allele a or mutated genotype (a/a or a/b) between T1D and T2D populations. In conclusion, our results indicate that allele a of the intron 4 endothelial NO synthase gene is associated with susceptibility to both T1D and T2D and may represent a common genetic factor for diabetes."
PMID:18500747	Martinez L, Mirabal S, Luis JR, Herrera RJ	Am J Phys Anthropol. 137(2):213-23	2008	Middle Eastern and European mtDNA lineages characterize populations from eastern Crete. 	Throughout centuries, the geographic location of the island of Crete has been one of the leading factors shaping the composition of its population. Invasions and commercial and cultural ties at various time periods with European, Middle Eastern, and North African civilizations have created a collage of genetic and/or cultural influences from each of these regions within the island. Previous Y-chromosome diversity analyses uncovered pronounced differences in the frequency distribution of haplogroups from a mountain refugium and surrounding lowland populations of eastern Crete. In this study, the current geographic stratification of mtDNA haplotypes in eastern Crete was explored to elucidate potential sources of maternal gene flow. Our work includes a comparative characterization of two lowland collections from the Heraklion and Lasithi Prefectures in eastern Crete, as well as of an isolated mountain population from the Lasithi Plateau, all three previously examined using Y-chromosome markers. In addition to the presence of European mtDNA haplogroups in all three collections, our analyses reveal a significant contribution of Middle Eastern and Central Asian genetic signatures in the island of Crete, and particularly in the two populations from the Lasithi region at the eastern-most portion of the island. Close association between these Cretan groups and the Balkans can also be discerned, which in the case of the Lasithi Plateau corroborates previously uncovered Y-chromosome affiliations with the same geographic region.

A new, fast and simple cleanup procedure, based on hollow-fibre liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME) is described here, used for the determination of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in complex pine needle samples. Initially, pine needle samples were sonicated in a 20 mL aqueous solution having a 20% (v:v) acetone content and 5 mL of the sonicated liquid extract was then used for the HF-LPME cleanup step. Different experimental parameters (namely: type of organic solvent used as acceptor phase, effect and type of co-solvent, salt addition, sample agitation and sampling time) were controlled and optimized based on the response of GC-MS instrument under the SIM mode. Under the optimized experimental conditions found the typical chromatograms obtained revealed that despite the very complex matrix of pine needles the HF-LPME cleanup step greatly reduced if not eliminated the presence of interferents, resulting in chromatograms which contained very cleanly separated and readily evaluable PAH peaks. In addition, the proposed method was found to be linear in the concentration 10-2000 ngg(-1) for most target analytes and the limits of detection for a S/N=3 ranged between 0.01 and 0.95 ngg(-1) (dry weight). Furthermore, the repeatability and reproducibility were also found good. Finally, the proposed method was applied for the analysis of real pine needle samples taken for different parts of the island of Crete.

"Placenta creta is associated with massive postpartum hemorrhage and commonly leads to emergency hysterectomy. While the exact pathogenesis of placenta creta is unknown, proposed hypotheses include a primary deficiency of decidua, abnormal maternal vascular remodeling, excessive trophoblastic invasion, or a combination thereof. To assess these changes in placenta creta, we retrospectively reviewed 49 cases of gravid hysterectomy, 38 with and 11 without the diagnosis of creta, gathered clinical data, and evaluated histopathology of extravillous trophoblast. Specifically, we evaluated maternal vessels for remodeling by endovascular trophoblast, as well as the morphology and depth of invasion of interstitial trophoblast at the implantation site. Compared to controls, cases with creta had decreased proportion of remodeled vessels, with many vessels displaying partial physiologic change. Cases with creta also demonstrated vascular remodeling deeper in the myometrium; however, vascular remodeling of large outer myometrial vessels was only demonstrated in increta and percreta cases, and was absent in both non-creta and accreta. As previously reported, interstitial trophoblast invaded the uterine wall to a significantly greater depth in placenta creta; however, there was no significant difference between creta subtypes. Finally, Ki-67 staining was rarely observed in extravillous trophoblast, except in the trophoblast columns of first trimester creta cases. We, therefore, conclude that the pathogenesis of placenta creta is multi-dimensional, involving increased, but incomplete trophoblast invasion in a background of absent decidua. We further propose that placenta increta and percreta are not due to a further invasion of extravillous trophoblast in the uterine wall, rather they likely arise secondary to dehiscence of a scar, leading to the presence of chorionic villi deep within the uterine wall, and thus give extravillous trophoblast greater access to the deep myometrium."

"Identification and assessment of predictive factors of in-hospital mortality of trauma patients injured in vehicle accidents. We reviewed the Trauma Registry data of Herakleion University Hospital, a level I trauma center in Crete, Greece. All 730 consecutive, adult motor-vehicle trauma patients admitted to our hospital from 1997 to 2000 were included in the study. Variables included in the analysis were: sex, age, mechanism of injury, injuries per anatomic region, initial vital signs, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), and the final outcome. In order to better describe continuous variables, two categories were created: age &gt; or = 60 and &lt;60; ISS &gt; or = 18 and &lt;18. Mortality rate was 4.8% (n=35). Multivariate survival analysis showed that age greater than or equal to 60 years (p=0.0002), ISS greater than or equal to 18 (p=0.003), being a pedestrian (p=0.007), craniocerebral injuries (p=0.01), thoracic (p=0.01), and abdominal injuries (p=0.01) are independent predictors of the in-hospital mortality of the patients. Trauma patients after vehicle accidents aged &gt; or = 60, pedestrians, those with an ISS &gt; or = 18 and craniocerebral, thoracic or abdominal injuries are at higher risk of an in-hospital fatal outcome."
PMID:18554832	Steyn M, Işcan MY	Forensic Sci Int. 179(1):86.e1-6	2008	Metric sex determination from the pelvis in modern Greeks. 	The ability to determine sex from unknown skeletal remains is vital, and methods to do this on the various bones of the human skeleton have been researched extensively. Many researchers have emphasized the need for population specific data for methods which are based on measurements, as there are vast differences in body size in various populations. The pelvis is known to be the most sexually dimorphic part of the human body, and no discriminant function formulae for this bone are available for Greek or other Mediterranean groups. The purpose of this study was therefore to develop discriminant functions which can be used for sex determination on measurements of the pelvis of modern Greeks. A sample of 97 male and 95 female pelves in a skeletal collection housed in Heraklion, Crete, was used. Measurements were taken from the articulated pelvis, single os coxae and the sacrum. Discriminant function formulae for all measurements and various combinations were used in order to assess the degree of sexual dimorphism in various parts of the pelvis, and to make the formulae usable on fragmented remains. For the single os coxae, average accuracies of 79.7-95.4% (79.1-93.5% on cross-validation) were found. However, it was found that measurements of the sciatic notch were unreliable and yielded poor results, and it is advisable that this characteristic must only be used as a last resort. Dimensions of the sacrum were not very dimorphic (average accuracy 60.9%), while measurements from the articulated pelvis yielded poorer results than that from single innominate bones. The diameter of the acetabulum was the single most dimorphic characteristic, providing on average 83.9% accuracy when used in isolation.

"Greece is one of the first countries of the European Union to introduce a human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine in its national vaccination programme. Geographical variations in the prevalence of the different HPV types have been demonstrated. The aim of this preliminary case control study was to investigate HPV infection in women with low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) from two different geographical areas of Greece; Central Greece and Crete. Seventy-five cervical specimens were collected from women with SILs from Crete and Central Greece. HPV detection and typing were performed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. HPV-18 was detected more frequently in Crete than in the Central Greece samples (29.7 vs 13.1%). HPV-16 was predominant in Central Greece (34.2%), while in Crete it was detected in 23% of the studied women. Non-16/-18 HPV types were detected in 45.9% of the women from Crete and 52.6% of the women from Central Greece. No relationship was observed between the geographical distribution of HPV and the presence of K-ras or B-raf point mutations in either group. Our pre-vaccination data indicate a high prevalence of HPV-18 in Crete. A trend for difference was observed in the rates of non-HPV-16/-18 women between the two areas. A large epidemiological study is required to investigate the prevalence of the different HPV types to further investigate the effectiveness of HPV vaccination in the Greek population."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial disease that is increasing in incidence worldwide. It is associated with a complex mode of inheritance, with many genes being involved in the development and progression of the disease. Genome-wide association studies in different populations have recently revealed a significant association between a TRAF1/C5 and a STAT4 polymorphism and the development of RA. In the present study we performed a case-control study in the population of the island of Crete, Greece, aiming to replicate the former findings in a genetically homogeneous cohort of patients. We found that mutated allele A or genotypes A/A and G/A of the TRAF1/C5 rs10818488 SNP were more common in individuals with RA than in control individuals (odds ratio [OR]=1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.35-2.15, and OR=2.22, 95% CI=1.61-3.05, respectively). Similarly, mutated allele T or genotypes T/T and G/T of the STAT4 rs7574865 SNP were also associated with susceptibility to RA (OR=1.9, 95% CI=1.46-2.50, and OR=2.37, 95% CI 1.73-2.25, respectively). Thus, we conclude that mutant alleles or genotypes of both polymorphisms examined are associated with the development of RA in our population.

To examine the effect of heterogeneous case mix for a benchmarking analysis and interhospital comparison of the prevalence rates of nosocomial infection. Cross-sectional survey. Eleven hospitals located in Cyprus and in the region of Crete in Greece. The survey included all inpatients in the medical, surgical, pediatric, and gynecology-obstetrics wards, as well as those in intensive care units. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria were used to define nosocomial infection. The information collected for all patients included demographic characteristics, primary admission diagnosis, Karnofsky functional status index, Charlson comorbidity index, McCabe-Jackson severity of illness classification, use of antibiotics, and prior exposures to medical and surgical risk factors. Outcome data were also recorded for all patients. Case mix-adjusted rates were calculated by using a multivariate logistic regression model for nosocomial infection risk and an indirect standardization method.Results. The overall prevalence rate of nosocomial infection was 7.0% (95% confidence interval, 5.9%-8.3%) among 1,832 screened patients. Significant variation in nosocomial infection rates was observed across hospitals (range, 2.2%-9.6%). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the mean predicted risk of nosocomial infection across hospitals ranged from 3.7% to 10.3%, suggesting considerable variation in patient risk. Case mix-adjusted rates ranged from 2.6% to 12.4%, and the relative ranking of hospitals was affected by case-mix adjustment in 8 cases (72.8%). Nosocomial infection was significantly and independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 3.6 [95% confidence interval, 2.1-6.1]). The first attempt to rank the risk of nosocomial infection in these regions demonstrated the importance of accounting for heterogeneous case mix before attempting interhospital comparisons.

DNA analysis identified the inheritance of common alpha(+)-thalassemia (alpha(+)-thal) mutations in trans to an in-frame 3 bp deletion at codons 38/39 (-ACC) on the alpha1-globin gene, previously described as Hb Taybe. Hematological findings in the parents of three of the Hb Taybe carrier cases, together with a fourth unrelated carrier, are also presented. These cases represent the first observation of Hb Taybe in the Greek population, as to date, it has only been observed in Israeli-Arab families. With the exception of one patient and his mother who both originate from Corfu, all our cases come from the Greek island of Crete.

Environmental factors are known to influence strongly the accumulation of secondary metabolites in plant tissues. In a previous paper, we studied the contents of (pseudo)hypericin and its immediate precursors in wild populations of various HYPERICUM species on the island of Crete, Greece, in dependence on their developmental stage. In this study, we investigated the effect of the habitat altitude on the total hypericins content of the plants, which is defined as the sum of protohypericin, hypericin, protopseudohypericin and pseudohypericin. Taking into account our previous finding that the highest accumulation is found during the flowering period in June, we collected the aerial parts of spontaneously growing H. PERFORATUM L. , H. TRIQUENTRIFOLIUM Turra , H. EMPETRIFOLIUM Willd. and H. PERFOLIATUM L. during that time frame at elevations between 100 and 600 m above sea level, however, bearing in mind the time lag in development with increasing altitude. HPLC analysis of the plant material, separated again into a flowers and a leaves/petioles fraction, revealed great differences in the total hypericin content in dependence on the altitude of the habitat. Specifically, a clear trend was revealed, showing an increase of the total hypericin content with increasing altitude. However, no changes could be observed in the ratio of hypericin to protohypericin and in that of pseudohypericin to protopseudohypericin. The habitats of the employed plants were again randomly distributed all over Crete. It is proposed that higher light intensities accompanied by enhanced UV-B radiation and lower air temperature might be responsible for the increasing levels of total hypericins with increasing altitude

"To assess the intake of sugar-added beverages such as soft drinks and commercially available fruit juices in kindergarten children, and to examine its association with obesity indices, physical activity levels and dietary habits. A total of 856 children aged 4-7 years living in Crete, Greece in 2004-5 were included in this cross-sectional study. Nutrient and food intake was assessed with the use of 3-day weighed food records. Body measurements were used in order to assess BMI and waist circumference, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was calculated with the use of a questionnaire. Approximately 59.8% of all children consumed sugar-added beverages on a daily basis. High intake of sugar-added beverages (&gt; 250 g/day) was associated with low intakes of calcium (p &lt; 0.001), vitamin A and E (p &lt; 0.010), fruits and vegetables (p = 0.007), and milk and yogurt (p = 0.048). Compared to non or low consumers, high consumers of sugar-added beverages (&gt; 250 g/day) had higher BMI levels and two times greater risk of being overweight and/or obese (OR:2.35, p = 0.023). High intake of sugar-added beverages in kindergarten children is associated with poor eating habits and inadequate nutrient intake, as well as increased risk for developing childhood obesity."

"In Greece there are no official recommendations concerning the management of pregnant women for the prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis. A protocol for monitoring pregnant women was designed in order to differentiate between acute and latent toxoplasmosis and was tested successfully for 7 years. The maternofetal transmission rate in Crete was assessed and a map showing seroprevalence of pregnant women in all prefectures of Greece was prepared. The high seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in Greece (up to 46% in some areas) may be explained by: (a) the presence of a great number of stray cats; (b) the Greek diet consisting of large amounts of raw, wild vegetables and salads that could easily be contaminated with oocysts; (c) the high consumption of meat, smoked pork and sausages, well-documented sources of T. gondii infection. T. gondii genotypes were characterized, directly from clinical samples, after PCR-RFLP on the SAG2 gene and sequence analysis at the restriction sites. They belonged to all 3 clonal lineages."

Molecular genotyping has been used to characterize Toxoplasma gondii strains into the three clonal lineages known as types I, II, and III. To characterize T. gondii strains from Greece and Cyprus, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on the GRA6 gene was performed directly on 20 clinical samples from 18 humans (11 pregnant women, six patients with lymphadenopathy, and one patient positive for human immunodeficiency virus) and two rats. Characterization of T. gondii types was performed after digestion of amplified products with Mse I. The 20 strains were characterized as type II (20%) and type III (80%). Of these strains, 19 originated from the island of Crete (4 strains type II and 15 strains type III), and 1 from the island of Cyprus (type III). Although both type II and type III strains were found, type III was the most prevalent in Crete.

Mycobacterium malmoense was isolated from a broncho-alveolar lavage sample of a 73-year-old cancer (small cell lung carcinoma) patient in Crete, representing the first reported case of this pathogen in Greece. The isolate was considered to be a colonizer and the patient did not receive any antimycobacterial treatment while he received chemotherapy to which he responded favourably. No signs of pulmonary infection were noted during the course of his disease. This case provides evidence of the ubiquitous nature of this mycobacterial species, believed until recently to favour cooler climates. We, therefore, propose that the index of suspicion for this pathogen should be raised particularly in patients with underlying immunodeficiency, cancer and chronic lung disease, irrespective of the geographic location.

A case-control study. 	The incidence of childhood insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is rapidly increasing in Greece. The aim of this study was to examine nutrient patterns of children and adolescents with IDDM in Crete. A case-control survey of eating habits was conducted among 41 children and adolescents, aged 6-17 years, with IDDM (cases) and healthy sex- and age-matched controls, recruited from Heraklion University Hospital and the village of Rouvas, Crete, respectively. Dietary data was based on 24-hour recall records. Dietary intake was similar between the groups. Both groups exceeded the recommendations for total and saturated fat and consumed lower than recommended amounts of dietary fibre and total carbohydrates. Children with IDDM consumed more dairy products and vegetables and less meats and cereals. Vegetables were consumed by a relatively high proportion of children and adolescents in both groups, but there was a higher proportion of fruit consumers amongst the IDDM group. For those who ate fruit and vegetables, intake approximated current recommendations of 400 g/day. The need to increase complex carbohydrates and reduce the consumption of total and saturated fat, in order to approach the traditional dietary pattern of Crete for this population, should be addressed via appropriate nutrition education programmes.

"Despite the fact that sex assessment using craniofacial characteristics is commonly made worldwide, a lack of such investigation is noted in the Balkan area and in Greece in particular. The aim of this study is to develop a sex determination technique using osteometric data from skeletal remains of a contemporary Cretan cemetery population. A total of 90 males and 88 females are measured according to standard osteometric techniques. Age differences are not significant (mean age for men=68.94+/-13.41, N=66; for women=73.21+/-16.77, N=66). A total of 16 dimensions taken from the craniofacial skeleton are used and data are analyzed using SPSS subroutines. A comparison is made with other contemporary populations, including Americans (Terry collection) and South Africans (Dart and Pretoria collections), as well as an archaeological sample (Middle and Late Helladic) from Crete. Results indicate that males are statistically significantly greater than females in all dimensions. Bizygomatic breadth is the most discriminatory single dimension and can provide an accuracy rate of 82% on average. Using a stepwise method involving five dimensions (bizygomatic breadth, cranial length, nasion-prosthion and mastoid height and nasal breadth), accuracy is raised to 88.2%. Interestingly, cranial length is selected as the first discriminating variable by the stepwise analysis when only the neurocranium is available for measurement."

"The paper presents an application of the ""Fit between Individuals, Task and Technology"" (FITT) framework to analyze the socio-organizational-technical factors that influence IT adoption in the healthcare domain. The FITT framework was employed as the theoretical instrument for a retrospective analysis of a 15-year effort in implementing IT systems and eHealth services in the context of a Regional Health Information Network in Crete. Quantitative and qualitative research methods, interviews and participant observations were employed to gather data from a case study that involved the entire region of Crete. The detailed analysis of the case study based on the FITT framework, showed common features, but also differences of IT adoption within the various health organizations. The emerging picture is a complex nexus of factors contributing to IT adoption, and multi-level interventional strategies to promote IT use. The work presented in this paper shows the applicability of the FITT framework in explaining the complexity of aspects observed in the implementation of healthcare information systems. The reported experiences reveal that fit management can be viewed as a system with a feedback loop that is never really stable, but ever changing based on external factors or deliberate interventions. Management of fit, therefore, becomes a constant and complex task for the whole life cycle of IT systems."

Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria, which typically spread in the host population by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In Drosophila melanogaster, Wolbachia is quite common but CI is variable, with most of the studies reporting low levels of CI. Surveying mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and infection status in a worldwide D. melanogaster collection, we found that the Wolbachia infection was not randomly distributed among flies with different mtDNA haplotypes. This preferential infection of some mtDNA haplotypes could be caused by a recent spread of mtDNA haplotypes associated with the infection. The comparison of contemporary D. melanogaster samples with lines collected more than 50 years ago shows that indeed one haplotype with a high incidence of Wolbachia infection has increased in frequency. Consistent with this observation, we found that the acquisition of a Wolbachia infection in a population from Crete was accompanied with an almost complete mtDNA replacement, with the Wolbachia-associated haplotype becoming abundant. Although it is difficult to identify the evolutionary forces causing the global increase of wMel, the parallel sweep of Wolbachia and an mtDNA haplotype suggests a fitness advantage of the Wolbachia infection.

Cigarette smoke itself is an abundant source of free radicals and a major cause of oxidative stress, to which plasma antioxidants function as a vital protective and counterbalancing mechanism. The objective of this study was to investigate into the relationship between smoking status and serum and dietary micronutrient concentrations. Cross-sectional study SUBJECTS - SETTING: 502 farmers from the Valley of Messara in Crete were randomly selected and examined. Complete three-day and 24-hr recall questionnaires were collected along with anthropometrical, physical activity and clinical data from all participating subjects. After adjusting for age, gender and number of fasting days adhered to per year, current smokers were found to have a lower dietary intake of vitamin C (112.1 mg vs. 136.4 mg, p = 0.03), fibre (16.6 g vs. 19.1 g, p = 0.006) and fruits and vegetables (339 g vs. 412 g, p = 0.014), while dietary vitamin B1 intake was found to be higher (1.7 mg vs. 1.4 mg, p = 0.02) in comparison to non/ex smokers. Dietary intake of meat, folate and vitami A, E, B2, B6 and B12 did not differ between the groups. Controlling age, gender, fasting days and dietary micronutrient intake, serum folate levels were found to be lower among smokers (geometric mean 15.3 nmol/L vs. 17.7 nmol/L, p = 0.023), while serum iron and vitamin B12 levels were not affected by smoking status. Current smoking status affects dietary nutrient intake as well as plasma folate levels. The above coherence between antioxidant depletion and reduced antioxidant intake may predispose smokers to the premature development of tobacco related mortality and morbidity.

The flavonoid content of several methanolic extract fractions of Navel orange peel (flavedo and albedo of Citrus sinensis) cultivated in Crete (Greece) was first analysed phytochemically and then assessed for its antioxidant activity in vitro. The chemical structures of the constituents fractionated were originally determined by comparing their retention times and the obtained UV spectral data with the available bibliographic data and further verified by detailed LC-DAD-MS (ESI+) analysis. The main flavonoid groups found within the fractions examined were polymethoxylated flavones, O-glycosylated flavones, C-glycosylated flavones, O-glycosylated flavonols, O-glycosylated flavanones and phenolic acids along with their ester derivatives. In addition, the quantitative HPLC analysis confirmed that hesperidin is the major flavonoid glycoside found in the orange peel. Interestingly enough, its quantity at 48 mg/g of dry peel permits the commercial use of orange peel as a source for the production of hesperidin. The antioxidant activity of the orange peel methanolic extract fractions was evaluated by applying two complementary methodologies, DPPH(*) assay and the Co(II)/EDTA-induced luminol chemiluminescence approach. Overall, the results have shown that orange peel methanolic extracts possess moderate antioxidant activity as compared with the activity seen in tests where the corresponding aglycones, diosmetin and hesperetin were assessed in different ratios.

The purpose of the present retrospective study is to describe the antibiotic susceptibility to several common antibiotics of 930 consecutive clinical isolates of H. influenzae over the period of 1996-2005 in a tertiary general hospital on the island of Crete, Greece. Overall, 9.5% of the isolates were beta-lactamase producing. Resistance to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate was observed in 11 and 0.6% of the strains, respectively, remaining stable throughout the study period. Resistance to tetracycline increased from 1.6% in 1996 to 38% in 2005, while resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin was &lt;1%. A significant decrease in resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed during the study period. No significant changes in resistance to other antimicrobials were seen. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and older quinolones remain potent agents against H. influenzae. Constant surveillance ofantibiotic susceptibility of H. influenzae clinical isolates is important in order to guide appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy."

The aim of this study was to present data of the cochlear implant programme in Crete. Our series consists of 51 patients, 35 adults and 16 children, in a nine year period. The average age of our patients was 31 years (range from three to 68). The average duration of deafness among our patients was seven years (range from two to 22). Our series included 32 postlingual patients and 19 prelingual patients. The cause of deafness in our series was unknown in approximately 40 per cent of cases. Standard selection criteria and operative techniques were used for all cases. Postoperative programming and rehabilitation were performed according to the individual needs of each patient. Implantation was successful in all patients except one who had to undergo a second operation with good results. No major postoperative complications were noted, while minor complications included temporary facial weakness and undesired stimulation of the facial nerve during implant function in two and three patients, respectively. All patients showed significant improvement in perception and discrimination of sound and speech. Better results have been noted in prelingual patients under the age of six, as well as in postlingual adults with a recent history of deafness. As cochlear implant technology evolves and surgical techniques continue to improve, our department will continue its efforts to provide effective hearing rehabilitation of deaf children and adults in Crete.

The aim of this study was to measure the quality of life in patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure, who make up the majority of admissions to an acute hospital cardiology unit. The study was undertaken in the General Hospital of Agios Nikolaos, Crete, and recruited 153 patients. The SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires were administered to evaluate health-related quality of life at hospital admission, discharge and one month after the discharge date. The analysis indicates that the quality of life of coronary disease patients is quite low and improved very marginally between admission and one month post discharge. The same applies for heart failure patients, who are associated with even lower quality of life scores. As illness affects all aspects of life, such as physical functioning, emotional balance, social role and general wellbeing, measurement of quality of life is considered to be an important factor in the assessment of the objective and subjective status of the individual's health. It appears in this context that patients with cardiac conditions suffer a significant deterioration in their quality of life status.

ABSTRACT The geographic incidence and molecular variation of three whitefly-borne closteroviruses (lettuce infectious yellows virus [LIYV], cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus [CYSDV], and beet pseudo-yellows virus [BPYV]) were studied in cucurbits collected from several distinct geographic locations. Of 498 samples analyzed, none were found to be infected by LIYV. Sixty-nine samples collected in the Middle East and Mediterranean Europe were found infected by CYSDV, and twelve samples from Crete and Italy were infected by BPYV. Reverse-transcription poly-merase chain reaction of a portion of the heat shock protein 70 homolog coding region, followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analysis, was used to estimate the intra- and inter-isolate molecular variability. These analyses showed that each BPYV and CYSDV isolate was composed of a population of sequence variants with a nucleotide identity greater than 98%. CYSDV isolates could be divided into two divergent groups. Group I was only composed of isolates from Spain, Jordan, and Turkey, and group II isolates were predominantly found in Saudi Arabia. Nucleotide identity between isolates of the same group was greater than 99%, whereas identity between both groups was less than 92%. All BPYV isolates showed a nucleotide identity greater than 98%.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and a leading cause of death from cancer in women in Europe. Although breast cancer incidence is on the rise worldwide, breast cancer mortality over the past 25 years has been stable or decreasing in some countries and a fall in breast cancer mortality rates in most European countries in the 1990s was reported by several studies, in contrast, in Greece have not reported these favourable trends. In Greece, the age-standardised incidence and mortality rate for breast cancer per 100.000 in 2006 was 81,8 and 21,7 and although it is lower than most other countries in Europe, the fall in breast cancer mortality that observed has not been as great as in other European countries. There is no national strategy for screening in this country. This study reports on the use of mammography among middle-aged women in rural Crete and investigates barriers to mammography screening encountered by women and their primary care physicians. Semi-structured individual interviews. Thirty women between 45-65 years of age, with a mean age of 54,6 years, and standard deviation 6,8 from rural areas of Crete and 28 qualified primary care physicians, with a mean age of 44,7 years and standard deviation 7,0 serving this rural population. Qualitative thematic analysis. Most women identified several reasons for not using mammography. These included poor knowledge of the benefits and indications for mammography screening, fear of pain during the procedure, fear of a serious diagnosis, embarrassment, stress while anticipating the results, cost and lack of physician recommendation. Physicians identified difficulties in scheduling an appointment as one reason women did not use mammography and both women and physicians identified distance from the screening site, transportation problems and the absence of symptoms as reasons for non-use. Women are inhibited from participating in mammography screening in rural Crete. The provision of more accessible screening services may improve this. However physician recommendation is important in overcoming women's inhibitions. Primary care physicians serving rural areas need to be aware of barriers preventing women from attending mammography screening and provide women with information and advice in a sensitive way so women can make informed decisions regarding breast cancer screening.

Currants and Sultanas (Vitis vinifera L.) are dried vine products produced in Greece and used broadly in the Mediterranean diet. We aimed to investigate the gastric cancer preventive activity of methanol extracts obtained from currants from three different origins in Greece (Vostizza, Nemea, and Messinia) as well as methanol extracts obtained from Sultanas cultivated in the island of Crete as to inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of inflammation. All extracts from 500 microg dried raisins studied suppressed cell proliferation, significantly those obtained from Sultanas from Crete and currants from Nemea. Flow cytometric analysis of Annexin-V labeled cells indicated that Cretan Sultana, Nemea, and Messinia currants at 500 microg dried product/ml medium significantly induced cell death. All extracts from 500 microg dried raisins statistically decreased protein and mRNA levels of ICAM-1 in TNF-alpha stimulated cells. Measurement of IL-8 protein levels and quantification for IL-8 mRNA showed no significant decrease. These results indicate that the methanol extracts from currants, rich in phenolic compounds, exhibit cancer preventive efficacy by limiting cell proliferation, inducing cell death, and suppressing ICAM-1 levels in AGS cells.

Mediterranean countries such as Greece have experienced rapid social change in the last decade. These community changes affect nutritional habits and there is a tendency for the traditional healthy Mediterranean diet to be abandoned. The parents of children from one rural Greek village on Crete (Neapolis), and one rural village in Sweden (Kisa) were invited to their primary health care centers for an interview and to fill in a validated nutrition questionnaire, KidMed. There were no differences (p = 0.48) in total KidMed score between the Cretan and Swedish children, adjusted for gender and age. However, there were some significant differences in scores on certain KidMed questions. Parents of the Cretan children reported significantly higher daily use of olive oil at home and more regular nut consumption, but also more commercially baked goods or pastries for breakfast. The parents of Swedish children reported significantly higher use of cereals, grains or bread for breakfast. The mean BMIs were similar for the Cretan (Neapolis mean 16.8, 95% CI 13.5-23.0) and for the Swedish children (Kisa mean 17.4, 95% CI 13.7-25.5) The results suggest the possibility of changing nutritional habits, measurable among young children in rural areas. The study raises the question of whether Cretan children may have abandoned some aspects of the traditional Mediterranean diet. It may also be that Swedish children have changed their diet in favor of a more Mediterranean food choice. The major limitation of the study is the small sample size, and further, larger studies are warranted.

In the present study we report the chemical composition of the Cretan Phoenix theophrasti Gr. fruits, in comparison with dates, from its close relative Phoenix dactylifera L. for their nutritional value and their potential exploitation as a source of bioactive components such as phytosterols, lipids and polyphenols. The non polar dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) extract of the fruits was analysed by several techniques (TLC, CC, GC and GC-MS) and was found to consist mainly from fatty acids, hydrocarbons and phytosterols. Palmitic acid was the most abundant fatty acid, 12.49% of total saponifiables, while beta-sitosterol was the most prevalent phytosterol, 29.46% of total unsaponifiable lipid fraction. The polar methanolic extract was examined for its total phenolic content, by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, as well as for its antioxidant activity through DPPH assay, in comparison with previous studies on the fruits of several Phoenix dactylifera varieties. This fraction was found to possess strong antioxidant activity despite its lower content of phenolic compounds in comparison with previously studied Phoenix dactylifera specimens.

"Myxobacteria are gliding bacteria that belong to the delta-Proteobacteria and are known for their unique biosynthetic capabilities. Among myxobacteria, Nannocystis spp. are most closely related to marine myxobacteria and their secondary metabolism has hardly been investigated. Phenylnannolones A (1), B (2) and C (3) were obtained from a culture of Nannocystis exedens that was isolated from the intertidal region of Crete. Compound 1 had inhibitory activity toward the ABCB1 gene product P-glycoprotein and reversed daunorubicin resistance in cultured cancer cells. Phenylnannolone A has an unusual structural architecture; it is composed of an ethyl-substituted polyene chain linked to a pyrone moiety on one side and to a phenyl ring on the other. The investigation of the biosynthesis with labelled precursors revealed acetate, butyrate and phenylalanine as building blocks for 1. The labelling pattern suggested novel biochemical reactions for the biosynthesis of the starter unit."

"Hygienic conditions in primary schools are a major concern for both governmental organizations and families. Particularly, the occurrence of faecal indicators on children's hands and various school surfaces has been associated with increased risk of diarrhoeal diseases. The presence of faecal streptococci on environmental surfaces and children's hands and the possible correlation with socio-economic factors were examined. Overall, 1956 samples from hands and 1470 samples from surfaces were collected from 20 primary schools in Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Faecal streptococci were found at 52.9% of children's hands and at 16.7% of other surfaces. Children, who had parents with the highest education level (&gt;12 years), had the lowest percentage (48.8%) of faecal contamination on their hands. Furthermore, boys exhibited higher levels of hands contamination compared with girls. Among the environmental surfaces examined, the school canteen reception was the most contaminated area. High faecal contamination was detected in primary schools in the examined region. Children's hands were highly infected (52.9%), while boys exhibited higher levels of contamination. The educational level of parents correlated well with the contamination of children's hands."

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is frequently diagnosed in primary care. Its diagnosis is based on diagnostic criteria but their use is limited in primary care.We aimed to assess the diagnostic agreement between the older (Manning's and Rome II) and the new (Rome III) criteria for the diagnosis of IBS in primary care in Greece. Medical records of 5 Health Centers in rural Crete, Greece, were reviewed for a four-year period and patients with the diagnosis of IBS were invited to a structured interview. Kappa agreement of the Rome III criteria with the criteria of Manning and Rome II was estimated. One hundred and twenty three patients were eligible for interview and 67 (54.5%) participated. Forty-six (69%) fulfilled the Manning, 32(48%) the Rome II, and 16(24%) the Rome III criteria. Twenty-seven (40%) patients were identified as IBS according to the questionnaire for the identification of functional gastrointestinal diseases (FGIDs). The agreement of Rome III with Manning criteria was poor (kappa = 0.25). The agreement between the FGIDs questionnaire and the Manning, Rome II and Rome III criteria was: kappa = 0.30, 0.31 and 0.24 respectively. Moderate agreement was found between the Rome II and III criteria (kappa = 0.51). Questionnaires and criteria deriving from expert's consensus meetings or tertiary hospitals are not easy to apply in rural primary care where symptoms are often underestimated by patients and complicated questions can be confusing.

"This study is the first culture-independent report on the regional variability of bacterial diversity in oxic sediments from the unexplored southern Cretan margin (SCM). Three main deep basins (water column depths: 2670-3603m), located at the mouth of two submarine canyons (Samaria Gorge and Paximades Channel) and an adjacent slope system, as well as two shallow upper-slope stations (water column depths: 215 and 520m), were sampled. A total of 454 clones were sequenced and the bacterial richness, estimated through five clone libraries using rarefaction analysis, ranged from 71 to 296 unique phylotypes. The average sequence identity of the retrieved Cretan margin sequences compared to the &gt;1,000,000 known rRNA sequences was only 93.5%. A diverse range of prokaryotes was found in the sediments, which were represented by 15 different taxonomic groups at the phylum level. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that these new sequences grouped with the phyla Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Gamma-, Alpha- and Delta-proteobacteria. Only a few bacterial clones were affiliated with Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia, Nitrospirae, Beta-proteobacteria, Lentisphaerae and Dictyoglomi. A large fraction of the retrieved sequences (12%) did not fall into any taxonomic division previously characterized by molecular criteria, whereas four novel division-level lineages, termed candidate division SCMs, were identified. Bacterial community composition demonstrated significant differences in comparison to previous phylogenetic studies. This divergence was mainly triggered by the dominance of Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria and reflected a bacterial community different from that currently known for oxic and pristine marine sediments."

During a 5-y period (2003 - 2007), nocardial infections were diagnosed in 15 patients admitted to the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Nine patients (60%) had 1 or more underlying conditions predisposing to nocardiosis. The skin was involved in 10 cases, followed by the lung in 4. One patient had disseminated disease. Five different species were identified: N. brasiliensis (n =7), N. otitidiscaviarum (n=4), N. abscessus (n=2), N. transvalensis (n=1), and N. farcinica (n=1). The most common species was N. brasiliensis. All isolates were sensitive to linezolid, moxifloxacin, and tigecycline, and 80% of them to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Antibiotics were given to all 15 patients. A clinical response was observed in 14 of them, while 1 died of nocardiosis. Nocardiosis is a rare but sometimes life-threatening infection, complicating immunosuppression. Early diagnosis and timely administration of appropriate treatment result in a favourable outcome.

"To examine the prevalence of an exon 12 polymorphism on the human Thromboxane synthase (CYP5A1) gene. Using sequence-specific PCR, we examined the allelic prevalence in 237 Greek patients with ischemic strokes and in 171 controls. In addition, we compared the CYP5A1 allelic prevalence in 71 patients with stroke recurrence despite Aspirin use, in comparison with patients who have not experienced recurrent stroke while taking Aspirin. The frequencies of the CYP5A1*9 mutant (substitution of guanine by adenine near the heme-binding catalytic domain) and of the wild-type allele were 0.197 and 0.803, respectively; they did not differ significantly between stroke patients and controls. The wild-type allele was more frequent in the Cretan population compared to continental Greece (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.19-2.74). The wild-type allele was more frequent among hypertensive and less frequent among diabetic stroke sufferers, respectively. The CYP5A1*9 mutant was significantly more prevalent among stroke patients with history of previous cerebrovascular attacks (p&lt;0.01); and among those who failed secondary Aspirin prophylaxis even after adjusting for the common risk factors for cardiovascular disease (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.06-2.11). Allelic prevalence of the CYP5A1 exon 12 might differ between geographic areas within the same ethnic group, and is associated with particular characteristics of stroke patients. Allele mutations can abolish the enzymatic activity of thromboxane synthase, via impaired heme binding, associated with defective response to Aspirin used as secondary prevention, an effect independent from the conventional risk factors for cerebrovascular disease."

"A major problem of crop protection in Crete, Greece, is the control of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) with chemical insecticides owing to the rapid development of resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the establishment of resistance and the underlying mechanisms to major insecticide classes with classical bioassays and known biochemical resistance markers. During a 2005-2007 survey, 53 Q biotype populations were collected. Application history records showed extensive use of neonicotinoids, organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids. High resistance levels were identified in the majority of populations (&gt;80%) for imidacloprid (RF: 38-1958x) and alpha-cypermethrin (RF: 30-600x). Low resistance levels (RF &lt; 12) were observed for pirimiphos-methyl. A strong correlation between resistance to imidacloprid and the number of applications with neonicotinoids was observed. Significant correlations were observed between COE and P450-dependent monoxygenase activity with resistance to alpha-cypermethrin and imidacloprid respectively. A propoxur-based AChE diagnostic test indicated that iAChE was widespread in most populations. Resistance levels for alpha-cypermethrin were increased when compared with a previous survey (2002-2003). Differentiation of LC(50) values between localities was observed for imidacloprid only. Bemisia tabaci resistance evolved differently in each of the three insecticides studied. Imidacloprid resistance seems less established and less persistent than alpha-cypermethrin resistance. The low resistance levels for pirimiphos-methyl suggest absence of cross-resistance with other organophosphates or carbamates used."

In this article, we show that methylation-specific multiplex PCR (MS-multiplex PCR) is a sensitive and specific single assay for detecting CpG methylation status as well as copy number aberrations. We used MS-multiplex PCR to simultaneously amplify three sequences: the 3' ends of the SNRPN gene (for unmethylated sequences), the KRITI gene (as internal control), and the promoter of the SNRPN gene containing CpG islands (for methylated sequences) after digestion with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (HhaI). We established this duplex assay for the analysis of 38 individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome, 2 individuals with Angelman syndrome, and 28 unaffected individuals. By comparing the copy number of the three regions, the methylation status and the copy number changes can be easily distinguished by MS-multiplex PCR without the need of bisulfite treatment of the DNA. The data showed that MS-multiplex PCR allows for the estimation of the methylation level by comparing the copy number aberrations of unknown samples to the standards with a known methylated status. The in-house-designed MS-multiplex PCR protocol is a relatively simple, cost-effective, and highly reproducible approach as a significant strategy in clinical applications for epigenetics in a routine laboratory.

Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) is a serious threat to public health, and a significant cause of lung cancer and heart disease among non-smokers. Even though Greek hospitals have been declared smoke free since 2002, smoking is still evident. Keeping the above into account, the aim of this study was to quantify the levels of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and to estimate the attributed lifetime excess heart disease and lung cancer deaths per 1000 of the hospital staff, in a large Greek public hospital. Environmental airborne respirable suspended particles (RSP) of PM2.5 were performed and the personnel's excess mortality risk was estimated using risk prediction formulas. Excluding the intensive care unit and the operating theatres, all wards and clinics were polluted with environmental tobacco smoke. Mean SHS-RSP measurements ranged from 11 to 1461 microg/m3 depending on the area. Open wards averaged 84 microg/m3 and the managing wards averaged 164 microg/m3 thus giving an excess lung cancer and heart disease of 1.12 (range 0.23-1.88) and 11.2 (range 2.3-18.8) personnel in wards and 2.35 (range 0.55-12.2) and 23.5 (range 5.5-122) of the managing staff per 1000 over a 40-year lifespan, respectively. Conclusively, SHS exposure in hospitals in Greece is prevalent and taking into account the excess heart disease and lung cancer mortality risk as also the immediate adverse health effects of SHS exposure, it is clear that proper implementation and enforcement of the legislation that bans smoking in hospitals is imperative to protect the health of patients and staff alike.

The question of what potential benefits and harms are associated with certain dietary regimes used in rheumatoid arthritis is an important one for many patients and health care providers. To assess the effectiveness and safety of dietary interventions in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)(The Cochrane Library, issue 1 2008), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL and reference lists of relevant articles (up to January 2008), and contacted authors of included articles. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) where the effectiveness of dietary manipulation was evaluated. Dietary supplement studies (including fish oil supplements) were not included. Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the internal validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information. Fourteen RCTs and one CCT, with a total of 837 patients, were included. Due to heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes, baseline imbalance and inadequate data reporting, no overall effects were calculated. A single trial with a moderate risk of bias found that fasting, followed by 13 months on a vegetarian diet, may reduce pain (mean difference (MD) on a 0 to 10 scale -1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.62 to -0.16), but not physical function or morning stiffness immediately after intervention. Another single trial with a moderate risk of bias found that a 12-week Cretan Mediterranean diet may reduce pain (MD on a 0 to 100 scale -14.00, 95% CI -23.6 to -4.37), but not physical function or morning stiffness immediately after intervention. Two trials compared a 4-week elemental diet with an ordinary diet and reported no significant differences in pain, function or stiffness. Due to inadequate data reporting, the effects of vegan and elimination diets are uncertain. When comparing any dietary manipulation with an ordinary diet we found a significantly higher total drop-out of 10% (risk difference (RD) 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.18), higher treatment-related drop-out of 5% (RD 0.05, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.14) and a significantly higher weight loss (weighted mean difference -3.23, 95% CI -4.79 to -1.67 kg) in the diet groups compared to the control groups. The effects of dietary manipulation, including vegetarian, Mediterranean, elemental and elimination diets, on rheumatoid arthritis are still uncertain due to the included studies being small, single trials with moderate to high risk of bias. Higher drop-out rates and weight loss in the groups with dietary manipulation indicate that potential adverse effects should not be ignored.

"Windrow composting of source-separated biowaste was studied in a pilot plant in Crete, with regard to abiotic factors, gas concentration in the pile and succession of functional microbial groups. The pH, C/N ratio and VS content, as well as the O(2) and CO(2) concentration, correlated well with composting time, indicating typical composting behaviour. Most of the microbial groups examined exhibited their highest counts towards the end of the thermophilic phase, with declining trends thereafter. The population of total mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria increased during the mild thermophilic phase and followed the temperature decline thereafter. Results on these microbial groups and fungi indicate that the timing of the thermophilic stage in the composting process, in addition to the peak temperature and duration of the stage, affects the microbial succession. Escherichia coli were detected for over 2 months of processing, in spite of the high temperatures achieved; only after about 3 months of composting did its population decline below the detection limit."

The effect of irrigation with saline water on oil quality was studied in the two olive ( Olea europaea L.) cultivars Koroneiki and Mastoidis, which are the main varieties grown extensively on the island of Crete. Plants (5 years old) were grown outdoors in containers, filled with freely drained light soil. Four treatments were applied, differing in the NaCl added to the irrigation water as follows: 0 (control) 50, 100, and 150 mM NaCl. Drip irrigation was applied regularly, during the dry season (from April to October). Plants in all treatments were irrigated when the soil-water potential reached -40 kPa at a depth of 30 cm. Data showed that increased NaCl levels in irrigation water resulted in a decrease in oil content in the fruits and an increase in total phenols and their secoiridoid derivatives in olive oils from harvested fruits. Furthermore, changes also took place in the composition of fatty acids and triacylglycerol molecular species. The extent of alterations was different for the two varieties and greater in cv. Koroneiki. This fitted with agronomic evidence that cv. Koroneiki is less saline-tolerant than cv. Mastoidis.

Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (W/Hip Ratio), waist-to-height ratio (W/Height Ratio), conicity index, percentage of body fat and hours of daily light physical activity (LPhA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPhA) were calculated for each subject. 86,1% of the study population was overweight and/or obese. Specifically 42.9% had a BMI of 25.1-30 kg/m(2) and were overweight and 43.2% were obese with a BMI&gt;30 kg/m(2). The percentage of body fat was estimated at 27.3% of total body weight among males and 39.3% among females, while all obesity indexes were found to differ between genders. In comparison to middle aged male farmers from Crete in the 1960s, mean weight has increased by 20 kg (83 kg vs. 63 kg), which has lead to a 7 kg/m(2) in mean BMI (22.9 kg/m(2) vs. 29.8 kg/m(2)), findings that support the fact that the prevalence of obesity in Greece has risen dramatically over the years, even among farmers from Crete, a population historically known for being the gold standard of health status globally."

"Four different pilot-scale treatment units were constructed to compare the feasibility of treating domestic wastewater in the City of Heraklio, Crete, Greece: (a) a free water surface (FWS) wetland system, (b) a horizontal subsurface flow (HSF) wetland system, (c) a rotating biological contactor (RBC), and (d) a packed bed filter (PBF). All units operated in parallel at various hydraulic loading rates (HLR) ranging from 50% to 175% of designed operating HLR. The study was conducted during an 8 month period and showed that COD removal efficiency of HSF was comparable (&gt;75%) to that of RBC and PBF, whereas that of the FWS system was only 57%. Average nutrient removal efficiencies for FWS, HSF, RBC and PBF were 6%, 21%, 40% and 43%, respectively for total nitrogen and 21%, 39%, 41% and 42%, respectively for total phosphorus. Removals of total coliforms were lowest in FWS and PBF (1.3 log units) and higher in HSF and RBC (2.3 to 2.6 log units). HSF showed slightly lower but comparable effluent quality to that of RBC and PBF systems, but the construction cost and energy requirements for this system are significantly lower. Overall the final decision for the best non-conventional wastewater treatment system depends on the construction and operation cost, the area demand and the required quality of effluent."

"In Greece, there is limited research on issues related to organ donation, and the low rate of registration as donors requires explanation. This study reports the findings of a survey of knowledge and attitudes to kidney donation among primary care patients in rural Crete, Greece. Two rural primary care settings in the island of Crete, Anogia Health Centre and Vrachasi Practice, were involved in a questionnaire survey. This was conducted among primary care patients (aged 18 years and over) with routine appointments, to assess their knowledge and attitudes to kidney donation. General practitioners (GPs) recruited patients and questionnaires were completed following the patients' medical consultation. Pearson's chi square tests were used and crude odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated in order to investigate into the possible associations between the respondents' knowledge, attitudes and specific concerns in relation to their socio-demographic features. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine differences by geographical location. The 224 (92.5%) of the 242 primary care attenders who were approached agreed to participate. Only 2.2% (5/224) of the respondents carried a donor card. Most participants (84.4%, 189/224) did not feel well informed about registering as a kidney donor. More than half of the respondents (54.3%, 121/223) were unwilling to register as a kidney donor and donate kidneys for transplant after death. Over a third of respondents (35.4%, 79/223) were not confident that medical teams would try as hard as possible to save the life of a person who has agreed to donate organs. People with a higher level of education were more likely to be willing to register as kidney donors [(OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.8-6.0), p &lt; 0.001)] and to be less worried about their kidneys being removed after death [(OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1-0.5), p &lt; 0.001)] than those having a lower level of education. Lack of knowledge and information regarding organ donation and negative attitudes related to registration as donors were the main findings of this study. Efforts should be based on targeting the attitudes to organ donation of individuals and population groups."

"This study aimed to assess children's diet quality in Crete and the potential role of several socio-demographic factors related to it. Between October 2005 and March 2006, 481 primary school children were recruited from Crete. Dietary intake data was obtained using a combination of techniques comprising a 24 h recall and 3 food diaries. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was calculated summing the individual scores (0-10) assigned to 10 index components. The majority of participants (84.5%) had diet that 'needs improvement' (HEI score: 51-80). Twelve percent of participants had 'poor diet' and only 3.5% of schoolchildren had 'good diet' (HEI score &gt;80). The overall mean of the HEI score was 60.5. The mean values of the HEI components score ranged between 2.8 (that is, the HEI component that measures vegetables intake) and 9.9 (that is, component that expresses the variety of consumed foods). Low mean values were found in the total fat and saturated fat components (3.7 and 3.4, respectively). Moreover, the HEI score was strongly associated with dietary macronutrients and micronutrients intake. On the basis of the HEI score, the vast majority of children were found to have a diet that 'needs improvement'. This indicates the increased necessity of drawing and implementing nutrition education programs targeting both children and their families and aiming to increase vegetables and fruits intake and reduce fat intake."

Two free water surface (FWS) and two subsurface flow (SSF) pilot-size wetlands were constructed for the evaluation of their performance in treating highway runoff (HRO) in the heart of the Mediterranean region, the island of Crete, at the southernmost point of Greece. Detailed recordings of the resources involved during the construction allowed a thorough calculation of the cost of the systems and the requirements in materials, man-hours, and equipment. The two identical FWS systems had a surface area of 33 m(2) each, while the two identical SSF covered 32 m(2) each. One FWS and one SSF, named FWS12 and SSF12, respectively, were designed with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 h, with each one capable of treating a maximum HRO of 12.6 m(3)/day. The other couple, named FWS24 and SSF24, respectively, was designed with an HRT of 24 h, with each receiving a maximum HRO of 6.3 m(3)/days. An influent storage tank was required to hold the runoff during the common storm events and control the flow rate (and the hydraulic retention time) into the wetlands. This construction represented 25% of the total construction cost, while 5% was spent on the influent automated (and sun-powered) control and distribution system, from the storage tank to the wetlands. The respective total cost allocated to the two SSF systems (euro 14,676) was approximately 10% higher than that of the FWS (euro 13,596), mainly due to the three different-sized gravel layers used in the SSF substrate compared to the topsoil used in the FWS, which tripled the cost and placement time. The Total Annual Economic Cost (TAEC) was euro 1799/year and euro 1847/year for the FWS and SSF pair, respectively. TAEC was also used to compare the economic efficiency of the systems per cubic meter of HRO treated and kilograms of COD and TSS removed from the wetlands during their first operational year. Based on these estimations, FWS12 recorded the lowest TAEC(COD) and TAEC(TSS) values (euro 89.09/kg and euro 43.69/kg, respectively) compared to the other three systems, presenting a more economically favorable option.

This paper takes a phenomenological hermeneutic orientation to explicate and explore the notion of the grey zone of health and illness and seeks to develop the concept through an examination of the case of alcohol consumption. The grey zone is an interpretive area referring to the irremediable zone of ambiguity that haunts even the most apparently resolute discourse. This idea points to an ontological indeterminacy, in the face of which decisions have to be made with regard to the health of a person (e.g., an alcoholic), a system (e.g., the health system), or a society. The fundamental character of this notion will be developed in relation to the discourse on health and the limitations of different disciplinary practices. The case of alcohol consumption will be used to tease out the grey zone embedded in the different kinds of knowledge made available through the disciplinary traditions of medical science, with its emphasis on somatic well-being, and anthropology, with its focus on communal well-being. This tension or grey zone embedded in different knowledge outcomes will be shown to have a discursive parallel with the dialogue between the Athenian, the Spartan, and the Cretan in Plato's Laws. Making use of the dialogical approach as described by Gadamer, the Athenian's particular resolution of the tension will be explored as a case study to demonstrate the necessarily particular analysis involved in a grey zone resolution.

Starting in May 2007, an ongoing outbreak of infections due to carbapenem resistant KPC-2-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae occurred in a tertiary care hospital in Crete (Greece). The outbreak involved 22 patients, none of whom had travelled in a country with known high prevalence of such isolates. KPC-producing K. pneumoniae strains were mainly isolated from patients admitted in the Intensive Care Unit, on mechanical ventilation, with prolonged hospitalization, prolonged administration of antibiotics, and prolonged administration of carbapenems. Clinical diagnoses were: pneumonia (62% of cases), surgical site infection (19%), bacteremia (9.5%), urinary tract infection (4.7%), and peritonitis (4.7%). Overall, 61 KPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolates were recovered, mainly from the respiratory tract (59.1%), catheter tip (22.7%), surgical site (18.2%), and blood (18.2%). Among 16 patients for whom therapeutic data were available, 14 (87.5%) were treated with a combination of colistin and/or tigecycline and/or garamycin. Clinical failure was noted in 22.2% of 18 patients available for assessment of clinical outcome, and microbiologic failure in 87.5% of 8 patients available for assessment of microbiologic outcome. In conclusion, an outbreak of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae infections has occurred in a tertiary care hospital in Greece, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Prospective studies are required to evaluate the available therapeutic options for these infections. Our efforts should focus on rational use of available antibiotics, enhancement of infection control measures, and implementation of active antibiotic resistance surveillance.

We sought to evaluate the link between long-term tea intake and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, in a sample of elderly adults. During 2005-2007, 300 men and women from Cyprus, 142 from Mitilini, 100 from Samothraki, 114 from Kefalonia, 131 from Crete, 150 from Corfu and 103 from Zakynthos (aged 65 to 100 years) were enrolled. Dietary habits (including tea consumption) were assessed through a food frequency questionnaire. Among various factors, fasting blood glucose was measured and prevalence of (type 2) diabetes mellitus was estimated. 54% of the participants reported that they consume tea at least once a week (mean intake 1.6 +/- 1.1 cup/day). The majority of the participants (98%) reported green or black tea consumption. The participants reported that they consume tea for at least 30 years of their life. After adjusting for various confounders, tea intake was inversely associated with lower blood glucose levels (b +/- SEM per 1 cup: - 5.9 +/- 2.6 mg/dL, p = 0.02). Moreover, multiple logistic regression revealed that moderate tea consumption (1 - 2 cups/day) was associated with 70% (95% CI 41% to 86%) lower odds of having (type 2) diabetes, irrespective of age, sex, body mass, smoking, physical activity status, dietary habits and other clinical characteristics. The presented findings suggest that long-term tea intake is associated with reduced levels of fasting blood glucose and lower prevalence of diabetes, in a cohort of elderly people living in Mediterranean islands.

The reproduction of single egg-mass isolates of Meloidogyne javanica from Crete that differed in virulence were compared on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) genotypes homozygous or heterozygous for the Mi gene. The reproduction of three isolates with partial virulence was much greater on tomato genotypes heterozygous for the Mi gene (cultivars Scala, Bermuda, and 7353) than on two homozygous genotypes (F8 inbred lines derived from Scala). The reproduction of a highly virulent isolate on the homozygous and heterozygous genotypes was similar to that on a susceptible cultivar. These results pose questions regarding the nature of partial virulence and indicate a quantitative effect of the Mi gene in relation to such virulence.

Thyroglossal duct cysts are remnants of the embryonic thyroglossal duct that may occur anywhere from the base of the tongue to the thyroid gland. The majority, however, are found at the level of the thyrohyoid membrane, under the deep cervical fascia. They are midline or just off the midline, and move up and down upon swallowing. This paper presents five case reports of TDC seen in the Department of Ear-Nose-Throat Surgery Regional Hospital Of Chania, Crete, Greece. It also discusses the different diagnostic approaches and differential diagnoses of the lesion. The medical records of patients admitted from 1995-2006 were reviewed for patients treated for TDC. History and examination reports were studied. When possible, results and reports of special investigations were obtained and the investigations were re-evaluated. Surgical operation notes and histology reports were obtained and the histologic slides were re-examined as necessary. Five cases of thyroglossal duct cyst treated in our department are described with each having a different clinical picture. Although the clinical and histological presentations of these five cases are not rare, they do illustrate how varied thyroglossal duct cysts can be with respect to patient age, anatomic site, or associated signs and symptoms.

"	"Hypercholesterolemia is one of the most important factors causing cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of the present work was to evaluate the relationships between socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle and depression status and the presence of hypercholesterolemia, among elderly individuals without known CVD. During 2005-2007, 1190 elderly (aged 65 to 100 years) men and women (from Cyprus, Mitilini, Samothraki, Cephalonia, Crete, Lemnos, Corfu and Zakynthos) were enrolled. Socio-demographic, clinical and lifestyle factors were assessed through standard procedures. Symptoms of depression were evaluated using the short-form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS, range 0-15). Dietary habits were assessed through a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total serum cholesterol &gt; 200 mg/dL or use of lipids lowering medication. 44.6% of males and 61.9% of females had hypercholesterolemia (p &lt; 0.001). Only, 63% of hypercholesterolemic participants were under special diet or pharmaceutical treatment. Hypercholisterolemic individuals had higher prevalence of obesity (43% vs. 25%), hypertension (76% vs. 57%) and diabetes (25% vs. 17%) compared with normal participants (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, hypercholisterolemic participants showed higher depression levels (p = 0.002). After adjusting for various confounders, GDS score and BMI correlated with 13% (95%CI 0.98-1.30) and 14% (95%CI 0.99-1.31) higher likelihood of having hypercholesterolemia. A considerable proportion of our elderly sample had hypercholesterolemia, while 1/3 of them were untreated. Furthermore, presence of hypercholesterolemia was correlated with depressive symptomatology and increased BMI."

The commonest causes of anaphylaxis include hymenoptera bites, high-risk food, exercise, and jellyfish bites and may often be encountered on the beach. Therefore, millions of visitors at popular touristic locations are exposed to increased risk of anaphylactic reactions every year. At least 35 cases of acute allergic reactions requiring medical attention took place on the beaches of Crete, Greece during the previous summer. To evaluate the level of training of lifeguards working on the beaches of the island of Crete, Greece, with regard to emergency management of anaphylaxis as well as to assess the sufficiency of medical equipment that lifeguards possess to treat an anaphylactic reaction. A questionnaire was prepared by the authors and administered to 50 lifeguards working on various beaches of Crete. Queries included the definition of anaphylaxis, proper medical treatment, and the existence or not and composition of an emergency kit with regard to the management of acute allergic reactions. Our series consisted of 50 lifeguards, 39 (78%) male and 11 female (22%). Although 41 (80%) lifeguards were aware of an acceptable definition of anaphylaxis, no one knew that epinephrine is the first-choice treatment, and 32 (60%) lifeguards replied that steroids should be used for emergency treatment. Additionally, no one possessed an emergency kit that would qualify for management of acute allergic reactions. The beach should be considered as a high-risk place for the appearance of anaphylactic reactions. Lifeguards who would be the first trained personnel to encounter this condition should be sufficiently trained and equipped for emergency treatment. Our department is currently introducing a training program to local authorities for the proper training and equipping of lifeguards in the island of Crete.

"Wohlfahrt's wound myiasis fly, Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Schiner) (Diptera: Sarcophagidae), is the most important cause of traumatic myiasis in the southern Palaearctic region. Larval stages are obligate parasites and the wounds caused by infestations are very similar to those caused by Old and New World screwworm flies. During the last decade, W. magnifica appears to have expanded its range to parts of northern and central Morocco, and to Crete, Greece. Specimens of W. magnifica were collected in Morocco and Crete either as larvae (preserved in 80% ethanol) or as adults (dry-pinned). Comparison specimens were collected in Spain, Hungary and mainland Greece. A DNA fragment containing the 3' 715 base pairs of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from each of 132 larvae or adults of W. magnifica and the amplicons were directly sequenced and analysed phylogeographically. Twelve cytochrome b haplotypes were detected. All haplotypes from Morocco belonged to a lineage that included specimens from the Iberian peninsula, and restricted mixing of central and northern populations in Morocco was demonstrated. Cytochrome b haplotyping combined with an analysis of larval size provided clear evidence of multiple infestations of hosts in all geographical areas, with one quarter of wounds containing larvae from two to at least four females. More than 80% of specimens from Crete contained a haplotype predominating in mainland Greece and Hungary. Our survey indicated that wohlfahrtiosis was more widespread in northern and central Morocco than previously recorded by government veterinarians. However, the prevalence of wohlfahrtiosis was low (&lt; 1%). The high genetic diversity of Moroccan populations is consistent with longterm endemicity, rather than recent introduction. Crete showed a higher prevalence of wohlfahrtiosis (&lt; or = 15%) and less genetic diversity of W. magnifica, which is consistent with a recent introduction. The western and eastern Mediterranean lineages may have been isolated in different Pleistocene ice-age refugia, from which there has been limited post-glacial dispersal."
PMID:19349011	Van Praagh R	Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg Pediatr Card Surg Annu. 19-38	2009	The first Stella van Praagh memorial lecture: the history and anatomy of tetralogy of Fallot. 	"Stella Van Praagh, MD (1927-2006) of Children's Hospital Boston was one of the greatest pediatric cardiologists and pediatric cardiac pathologists of the 20th and early 21st centuries. Née Stella Zacharioudaki from Crete, Greece, in addition to her stellar professional attainments, she was also an outstanding cuisinière, hostess, linguist, philosopher, and philanthropist. In 1962, she married Richard Van Praagh, MD, beginning a life-long collaboration that was in every sense an affaire de coeur. They had three children and seven grandchildren. Dr Stella was the author of more than 110 scientific publications which helped to clarify the pathologic anatomy, the clinical and laboratory diagnosis, and often the surgical management of many different forms of congenital heart disease, including dextrocardia, single ventricle, truncus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), transposition of the great arteries, double-outlet right ventricle, sinus venosus defect, anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, the heterotaxy syndromes with asplenia or polysplenia, juxtaposition of the atrial appendages, and apical muscular ventricular septal defect. In 1999, Dr Stella Van Praagh received the Distinguished Achievement Award of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology, and in 2004, she was honored with the Paul Dudley White Award of the American Heart Association. Dr. Stella Van Praagh was that vanishingly rare combination of brilliant clinician, internationally renowned medical scientist, and deeply cultivated humanist. The anomaly now known as the TOF was first described by Niels Stensen in 1671, with other early reports by Edouard Sandifort (1777), William Hunter (1784), and many others. In 1888, Etienne-Louis Arthur Fallot published five serialized contributions in Marseille Médical concerning what he called the ""blue malady,"" in which he described the now classical tetralogy of pulmonary outflow tract obstruction, ventricular septal defect, aortic overriding, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The other outstanding feature of Fallot's report was its emphasis on clinicopathologic correlation. In 1924, Maude Abbott coined the term ""tetralogy of Fallot."" In 1970, Van Praagh and colleagues presented the concept that the TOF is basically just one anomaly, a failure of normal expansile growth of the subpulmonary infundibulum and its sequelae. The anatomy of TOF is presented angiocardiographically, diagrammatically, and anatomically. A morphometric study of typical neonatal TOF is presented, based on 16 autopsied heart specimens with age-matched normal controls. The morphometric study documents that TOF is characterized by a low-volume subpulmonary infundibulum. The diagnostic and surgical significance of these findings is highlighted. Two rare and recently discovered forms of TOF are presented: tetralogy {S,D,I}, and tetralogy {I,D,S}. Because tetralogy {I,D,S} has atrioventricular discordance, in addition to a standard TOF repair, such patients also need an inverted (mirror-image) atrial switch operation (inverted Senning or inverted Mustard procedure). Because associated malformations can be very important to the surgical outcome of patients with tetralogy, the associated anomalies found in 100 randomly selected autopsied cases are presented."

To describe where (home or hospital) patients with cancer die in Greece, in 1995 and 2005. We used data from patients with cancer, who died in Greece in 1995 and 2005, and we studied the location changes of death in the 3 major geographical areas of Greece (Macedonia: North Greece, Central Greece, and Crete: South Greece). In Central Greece and Crete, death incidences for 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80+ age groups decreased from 1995 to 2005. In Crete, in 1995, male and female death incidences for 80+ age group dying at home was higher than the corresponding one dying in hospital. It seemed that in Greece, more cancer patients are dying in hospitals. Geographical and socioeconomic criteria might affect the place of death of a patient with cancer.

Current classifications of diabetes distinguish between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, recent evidence highlights overlap between T1D and T2D. In a recent study, we have suggested for the first time that STAT4 gene polymorphism is associated with increased risk for the development of T1D in the island of Crete, a well-defined area with genetically homogeneous population. The objective of this study was to investigate the putative association of STAT4 polymorphism with T2D. STAT4 encodes a transcription factor that transmits signals induced by several key cytokines, including interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma, a key indicator of T-cell differentiation into type 1 helper T (Th1) cells. Mutated allele T was more common in controls than in individuals with T2D (odds ratio [OR] = 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.022-2.470, p = 0.039). Mutated genotype G/T was more common in nondiabetic individuals than in T2D patients (OR = 1.735, 95% CI = 1.077-2.793, p = 0.024). Our results indicate that whilst allele T of the STAT4 rs7574865 gene polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to T1D, it is not associated with increased risk for and T2D, and thus does not represent a common genetic factor for diabetes.

The authors developed a sensitive analytical method for the determination of dialkyl phosphates (DAPs) in meconium. This method was applied to determine the DAPs, which are non-specific metabolites of the organophosphate pesticides (OPs), in meconium of newborns by mothers who live in rural areas in Crete, Greece. DAPs are considered as biomarkers of exposure to OPs. Meconium is produced in the foetus at approximately 16 weeks of gestation and it acts as a repository of many xenobiotics. The determined organophosphate metabolites were dimethylphosphate (DMP), diethylphosphate (DEP), dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP), diethylthiophosphate (DETP), and diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP). The DAPs were extracted from meconium by liquid-solid extraction, derivatized, and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The mean percentile recoveries were 76.9%, 65.2%, 94.1%, 109.4%, and 107.2% for DMP, DEP, DMTP, DETP, and DEDTP, respectively. The percentage of positive samples was 92.1% for DMP, 36.8% for DEP, 60.5% for DMTP, 63.2% for DETP, and 57.9% for DEDTP. Mean (+/- standard deviation) and the range concentrations of the positive samples (ng g(-1)) were 126.74 +/- 142.73 (10.64-739.45), 11.46 +/- 20.43 (1.50-79.14), 215.05 +/- 187.34 (8.54-662.16), 4.92 +/- 5.09 (1.25-19.04), and 1.84 +/- 2.07 (0.5-8.04) for DMP, DEP, DMTP, DETP, and DEDTP, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in meconium levels between high- and low-risk groups of exposure of pregnant women. However, the results of this study demonstrate that DAPs in meconium may be considered as a potential biomarker for the assessment of foetal exposure to organophosphate pesticides.

An answer from genetic and palaeobotanical data. 	This study represents the first large-scale analysis using nuclear molecular markers to assess genetic diversity and structure of Cupressus sempervirens L.. Genetic and fossil data were combined to infer the possible role of human activity and evolutionary history in shaping the diversity of cypress populations. We analysed 30 populations with six polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers. Dramatic reductions in heterozygosity and allelic richness were observed from east to west across the species range. Structure analysis assigned individuals to two main groups separating central Mediterranean and eastern populations. The two main groups could be further divided into five subgroups which showed the following geographical distributions: Turkey with the Greek islands Rhodes and Samos, Greece (Crete), Southern Italy, Northern Italy, Tunisia with Central Italy. This pattern of genetic structure is also supported by SAMOVA and Barrier analyses. Palaeobotanical data indicated that Cupressus was present in Italy in the Pliocene, Pleistocene and Holocene. Furthermore, our molecular survey showed that Italian cypress populations experienced bottlenecks that resulted in reduced genetic diversity and allelic richness and greater genetic differentiation. Recent colonization or introduction may also have influenced levels of diversity detected in the Italian populations, as most individuals found in this range today have multilocus genotypes that are also present in the eastern range of the species. The data reveal a new interpretation of the history of cypress distribution characterized by ancient eastern populations (Turkey and Greek islands) and a mosaic of recently introduced trees and remnants of ancient, depauperate populations in the central Mediterranean range.

These twenty last years, the metabolic syndrome was accused in various human pathologies including android obesity and type 2 diabetes. In obesity, increased body weight is frequently associated with excessive caloric food and sedentary activities. The Behaviour Eating Disorders (BED) is involved in over-consumption alimentary. In Algeria, we observed increasingly deviations in life-style alimentary, from the Mediterranean-Cretan model to American fast-food model. To study interactions between the BED, hormonal secretions and metabolic syndrome parameters. The present study was undertaken on Algerian population cohorts composed of 30 obese subjects, 70 type 2 diabetic patients and 30 healthy subjects. The BED was evaluated by TFEQ and DEBQ tests. Anthropometric parameters (waist circumference, IMC), metabolic parameters (glucose, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C) and hormones (insulin, peptide C, ACTH, cortisol, GH) were determinates by biometrics, spectrophotometry and radioimmunology methods, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed the high correlation between the BED and the metabolic syndrome, particularly a critical insulinoresistance state (IR). This IR generates in periphery a whole of metabolic disorders: dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertrophy of adipose tissue. In diabetic and obese patients, cortisol, ACTH and GH secretions are insidiously altered and to lead metabolic disorders. In this study, the role of the BED in obesity and diabetes genesis seems to be confirmed. In response to nutritional stress, the BED generates a hyperactivity of endocrine pancreas, adrenal gland, and pituitary gland. It appeared that Algerian population is not adapted to fast-food American model.

The purpose of this exploratory study was to assess occupational profile, level of performance, and on-the-job training needs of nursing staff employed in all government primary health care centers in rural Crete, Greece. The translated, culturally adapted, and validated Greek version of the Training Needs Assessment questionnaire was used. There were no significant differences between 2-year degree graduates (LPNs) and 3- or 4-year degree graduates (RNs, midwives, and health visitors) in terms of importance for 28 of 30 assigned tasks, whereas level of performance did not differ in any tasks. Significant training needs were reported by all staff, mainly in research/audit and clinical skills. Systematic overview of skill deficits in relation to skill requirements should be implemented by regional health authorities to enhance delivery of on-the-job training targeting group-specific, local needs.

Although early detection and systematic prevention of cancer improves outcomes and reduces mortality, General Practitioners' (GP) effectiveness remains an issue that merits further investigation. To explore cancer control practices of Greek GPs, a version of the Cancer Control Practices questionnaire, originally developed in Western New York in 2001, was translated and culturally adapted. Its reliability was found satisfactory in most the items. The instrument can be useful in determining Greek GPs' knowledge and application of internationally established cancer-related guidelines, barriers they face in daily practice, and educational or training needs.

"The TRAF1-C5 locus has recently been identified as a genetic risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Since genetic risk factors tend to overlap with several autoimmune diseases, a study was undertaken to investigate whether this region is associated with type 1 diabetes (TID), celiac disease (CD), systemic sclerosis (SSc) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The most consistently associated SNP, rs10818488, was genotyped in a total of 735 patients with T1D, 1049 with CD, 367 with SSc, 746 with SLE and 3494 ethnically- and geographically-matched healthy individuals. The replication sample set consisted of 99 patients with T1D, 272 with SLE and 482 healthy individuals from Crete. A significant association was detected between the rs10818488 A allele and T1D (OR 1.14, p=0.027) and SLE (OR 1.16, p=0.016), which was replicated in 99 patients with T1D, 272 with SLE and 482 controls from Crete (OR 1.64, p=0.002; OR 1.43, p=0.002, respectively). Joint analysis of all patients with T1D (N=961) and all patients with SLE (N=1018) compared with 3976 healthy individuals yielded an allelic common OR of 1.19 (p=0.002) and 1.22 (p=2.6 x 10(-4)), respectively. However, combining our dataset with the T1D sample set from the WTCCC resulted in a non-significant association (OR 1.06, p=0.087). In contrast, previously unpublished results from the SLEGEN study showed a significant association of the same allele (OR 1.19, p=0.0038) with an overall effect of 1.22 (p=1.02 x 10(-6)) in a total of 1577 patients with SLE and 4215 healthy individuals. A significant association was found for the TRAF1-C5 locus in SLE, implying that this region lies in a pathway relevant to multiple autoimmune diseases."

Our experience in Crete (Greece). 	The improvement in quality of cytological preparations with the use of LBP methodology has been well-documented, but the cytological artifacts resulting from this technique have not been adequately described. This study describes and illustrates the cytological artifacts introduced by LBP technique when used on fine-needle aspirates (FNAs), and evaluates these artifacts as potential diagnostic pitfalls. We reviewed a total of 96 FNAs simultaneously processed by both conventional smears and LBP. FNAs were obtained from the following sites: lymph node (38), breast (28), soft-tissue sites (nine), salivary glands (six), and thyroid gland (15). The LBP smears were consistently devoid of obscuring elements, and the cells were adequately preserved and evenly dispersed. However, we noted some cytomorphological alterations that should be recognized to avoid erroneous diagnoses. The size of cell clusters was decreased, large branching sheets were fragmented, and there were more single cells, resulting in apparent discohesion. Small cells such as lymphocytes tended to aggregate. All cells were generally smaller and occasionally spindled, the chromatin detail was attenuated, and nucleoli were more prominent. Intranuclear inclusions were difficult to visualize. Background matrix was often altered in both quantity and quality. Extracellular particles, small mononuclear cells, red blood cells, and myoepithelial cells were markedly decreased in number. Cytopathologists should be careful in interpreting FNAs prepared using LBP technique if that is the only methodology employed. Familiarity with artifacts is essential to avoid misdiagnoses.

Mistletoes are bird dispersed, hemi-parasitic shrubs infecting a large number of woody host plants. Chloroplast fragment length polymorphisms were used to study genetic differentiation among presumed host races, population genetic structure, and to elucidate the postglacial migration history of mistletoe (Viscum album) across the entire natural distribution range in Europe. The populations sampled belong to four closely related taxa, three of which are widely distributed and differ in their host trees, whereas a fourth taxon is rare and endemic to the Island of Crete. The molecular analysis of chloroplast DNA variation supported the distinction of these four taxa. We further found evidence for phylogeographical structure in each of the three widely distributed host races. Independent of host race, mistletoe haplotypes from Turkey were distinct and distant from those found elsewhere in Europe, suggesting that highly differentiated populations, and possibly new taxa, exist at the range limit of the species.

The determination of sex is considered one of the first essential steps in positive identification. The current study aspires to accomplish a threefold purpose: to develop an easy and rapid sex determination technique using digital radiographs from the proximal epiphysis of the femur, to develop a simplified tool for pathologists that will provide accurate sex identification using radiographs and to compare this method with standard osteometric techniques applied to the same population. A total of 70 (36 males and 34 females) left femora were measured according to standard osteometric techniques. The proximal epiphyses of the same sample were then radiographed using a digital X-ray machine (TCA 4R PLUS). The skeletal remains were selected from the exhumed skeletons of St. Konstantinos and Pateles Cemeteries, Heraklion, Crete. Nine classical measurements were taken from the entire dry femora. Stepwise discriminant function analysis selected only 2 dimensions (maximum head diameter and anterior-posterior midshaft diameter) producing an accuracy rate of 88.6% for both original and cross-validated data. If assuming that only the proximal part of the femur is present, direct procedure results in 87.1% correct group membership. Six landmarks were selected in the radiograph and 15 variables representing all possible combinations of these landmarks were calculated using a specially designed calibrated Java program. Measurements were submitted to discriminant function analysis using SPSS subroutines. Stepwise discriminant function analysis selected only 3 out of 15 dimensions, producing an accuracy rate of 92.9%. The formula generated was then incorporated into the Java application, resulting in the development of a sex identification software (SIS). A sample of 36 (23 left and 13 right) femoral radiographs was used in order to test the software's reliability and sex was correctly identified in 32/36 cases, giving an accuracy rate of 91.7%. The radiographic technique proposed here performed better compared to conventional methods in the same population. From a forensic point of view it is a useful alternative method when semi-decomposed or charred remains are recovered in mass disasters or crime scenes and maceration is not an option. The application of metric methods in radiographs and the development of a highly specific software provides a useful and easy tool for sex identification that can be used in certain forensic cases in which osteometry does not apply.
PMID:19446415	Kranioti EF, Bastir M, Sánchez-Meseguer A, Rosas A	Forensic Sci Int. 189(1-3):111.e1-8	2009	A geometric-morphometric study of the Cretan humerus for sex identification. 	Various scholars have pioneered sex assessment from different parts of the skeleton based on metrical or qualitative morphological characteristics. Lately though, a new technique which combines both traditional methods is becoming popular in forensic anthropology. Geometric-morphometrics is a field of multivariate statistical biometric analysis which allows the quantification of the shape and size components of morphological variation. The purpose of this investigation is to assess sex from the humerus in a contemporary Greek population using geometric-morphometric analysis of shape data derived from digital radiographs. The study population consists of 97 well-preserved adult humeri from two cemeteries of Heraklion, Crete. The left humeri are radiographed using digital radiograph machine (TCA 4R PLUS). Assuming fragmentary patterns, the proximal and distal ends are studied separately. Five landmarks are selected on the radiograph of the proximal epiphysis and seven landmarks on the distal. Generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA) and thin-plate splines are used to obtain the shape and size variables for statistical analysis. Then three discriminant function analyses were carried out: one uses the PC scores from Procrustes shape space, the second the centroid size alone and the third the PC scores of GPA residuals plus lnCS for analysis in Procrustes form space. Results indicate the existence of shape differences between the sexes. In females the greater tubercle is smoother, with its superior border less pronounced. Additionally, females have a relatively squared distal epiphysis, while males exhibit a more rectangular shape. Shape differences between genders, for the cross-validated data, give slightly better classification results in the proximal humerus (73%) compared with the distal humerus (71%). Size alone performed better (86.5% for proximal and 85.6% for distal humerus). As anticipated, the classification accuracy improves (89.6% for proximal and 89.7% for distal epiphysis) when both size and shape are combined. From the forensic standpoint, the usefulness of this study rests on the identification of sex based on shape differences observed on radiographs of fragmentary humeri that could not be assessed with traditional methods. The analysis of humeral radiographs by geometric-morphometric techniques offers an alternative way to identify the sex of unknown skeletal remains. Whether this is statistically better than simply using traditional osteometric methods is a question that needs to be tested in a meta-statistical approach.

"In this study, the field performance of two coverall designs used by pesticide applicators was determined. Two coverall types were selected based on data from previously conducted comfort testing under field conditions in southern Europe. Dermal exposure was measured during 22 applications conducted with 11 operators using similar hand-held spray guns in greenhouse pepper crops in the Ierapetra region of Crete, Greece. One of the coverall designs studied was made from a cotton/polyester material treated with a water-repellent Resist Spills(R) finish, which was compared in the field study to a coverall of similar design, but using a woven, untreated cotton material. An in-house analytical method was developed and validated for determining residues of the active substance (a.s.) malathion on the dosimeters. The derived levels of dermal exposure were used as a measure of the protection provided by the two types of coveralls. In addition, by comparing the total amount of the a.s. recovered from outer and inner dosimeters (potential dermal exposure = 238.8 mg kg(-1) a.s. for the cotton coverall and 160.44 mg kg(-1) a.s. for the Resist Spills coverall), a value could be determined for the degree of coverall penetration. The mean penetration (milligrams per kilogram a.s.) of the outer coveralls, calculated as a percentage of the total contamination, was 0.4% for the water-repellent coverall and 2.3% for the cotton coverall. The mean recovery from the laboratory and field-fortified samples was &gt;91 and 74%, respectively and used as the main criterion for quality control of the analytical data. Under the field trial conditions evaluated, both the coverall designs gave better protection than the default values used in the most relevant predictive exposure model. Therefore, they could be considered as appropriate tools of personal protection when both comfort and field performance is taken into account under the specific application scenario."

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of many complex diseases have successfully identified novel susceptibility loci, with many of them being associated with more than one condition. Taking into consideration that different autoimmune diseases may share some common pathogenetic pathways, we hypothesized that STAT4, a susceptibility gene found to be associated with increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, Sjögren's syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis may also have a role in psoriasis. Psoriasis is an autoimmune, chronic inflammatory skin disease. Here we performed a case-control study in the population of island of Crete and demonstrated for the first time the association of a STAT4 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with susceptibility to psoriasis, thus suggesting a putative key role of STAT4 in multiple autoimmune diseases. We found that mutated allele T of the STAT4 rs7574865 SNP, which previously was implicated in the predisposition to many autoimmune diseases, were more common in individuals with psoriasis than in controls (p = 0.045, odds ratio = 1.42, 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.00), thus concluding that the polymorphism examined is associated with the development of psoriasis in our population.

"To investigate the possible association between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) we conducted a prospective clinical and epidemiological study in a population of similar genetic background. The first-degree relatives of 303 PD probands and 249 controls from Crete were evaluated for the presence of ET. In addition, the possible co-occurrence of ET and PD in the same family or in the same individual was investigated. Results showed that ET was present in the relatives of PD patients more often than in those of controls (OR:3.64, P &lt; 0.001). The risk was even greater (OR: 4.48) when the affected proband had tremor-dominant or mixed PD. Female relatives and siblings of PD patients were more likely to have ET than male relatives and parents of PD patients (OR: 4.36 v/s 2.89 and 4.49 v/s 2.74, respectively). Twelve subjects had both ET and PD phenotypes. While this may have occurred by chance, a number of families were identified in which ET and PD were coinherited through the same parental line. Hence, in certain families ET and PD are genetically related probably sharing common hereditary predisposition."

We investigated the importance of sexual selection in facilitating speciation in a land snail radiation on Crete. We used differences in the genitalia of the Cretan Xerocrassa species as potential indices of sexual selection. First, we rejected the hypothesis that differences in the genitalia of the Xerocrassa species can be explained by genetic drift using coalescent simulations based on a mitochondrial gene tree. Second, we showed that there is no evidence for the hypothesis that the differences in the genitalia can be explained by natural selection against hybrids under the assumption that this is more likely in geographically overlapping species pairs and clades. Third, we showed that there is a positive scaling between male spermatophore-producing organs and female spermatophore-receiving organs indicating sexual coevolution. The spermatophore enables the sperm to escape from the female gametolytic organ. Thus, the coevolution might be a consequence of sexual conflict or cryptic female choice. Finally, we showed that the evolution of differences in the length of the flagellum that forms the tail of the spermatophore is concentrated toward the tips of the tree indicating that it is involved in speciation. If speciation is facilitated by sexual selection, niches may remain conserved and nonadaptive radiation may result.

"The aim of the present work was to evaluate the relationships between socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle and psychological characteristics and the presence of diabetes mellitus, among elderly individuals without known cardiovascular disease. During 2005-2007, 1190 elderly (aged 65 to 100 years) men and women (from Cyprus, Mitilini, Samothraki, Cephalonia, Crete, Lemnos, Corfu and Zakynthos) were enrolled. Socio-demographic, clinical and lifestyle factors were assessed using standard procedures. Diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting blood glucose &gt;125 mg/dl or use of special medication. 21% of males and 23% of females had diabetes. Only 70% of diabetic participants were on a special diet and 76% were receiving pharmaceutical treatment. Diabetic individuals had higher prevalence of hypertension (80% vs. 64%, p &lt; 0.001) and hypercholesterolemia (63% vs. 51%, p &lt; 0.001) and reported lower physical activity status (p &lt; 0.001), compared with non-diabetic participants. After adjusting for various confounders, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were associated with a 144% (95% CI, 1.37-4.35) and 83% (95% CI, 1.13-2.94) higher likelihood of having diabetes, while moderate and vigorous exercise correlated with a 82% (95% CI, 0.09-0.81) and 67% (95% CI, 0.11-0.97) lower likelihood of diabetes. A considerable proportion of our elderly sample had diabetes and other metabolic disorders, almost 25% of which were untreated. Promotion of physical activities, even in the elderly, may contribute to reducing their burden of diabetes and provide them with a better quality of living."

Inflorescences of arum lilies have a three-part spadix with a scent-producing, sterile appendix above two bands of fertile male and female florets. The appendix and male florets are thermogenic, but with different temporal patterns. Heat-production was measured in Arum concinnatum, A. creticum and A. idaeum. The male florets of A. concinnatum showed a 3 d continuous episode of thermogenesis with three waves, and the appendix warmed in a single, 6 h episode. Maximum fresh-mass-specific CO(2) production rate was 0.17 micromol s(-1) g(-1) to achieve a 10.9 degrees C temperature elevation by the appendix, and 0.92 micromol s(-1) g(-1) to achieve a 4.8 degrees C elevation by male florets. Reversible, physiological temperature regulation was not evident in either tissue. Respiration increased with tissue temperatures with Q(10) values of 1.8-3.9, rather than less than 1.0 as occurs in thermoregulatory flowers. Experimental step changes in temperature of appendix and male floret tissues also failed to show thermoregulatory responses. The patterns of thermogenesis therefore appear to be fixed by the temporal sequence of blooming. Thermogenesis in the alpine species, A. creticum and A. idaeum, was significantly lower than in the lowland A. concinnatum, possibly related to difficulty in raising floral temperature in their cold and windy habitat.

Mind-body interactions have been well recognized and are extendedly studied in the medical literature. There is evidence that the mind and body communicate with each other in a multidirectional flow of information by means of hormones, neurotransmitters/neuropeptides, cytokines, and semaphorines. There are consistent and convincing reports of links between stress and disease onset and progression, e.g. asthma. Growing evidence in the field of psychoneuroimmunology contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms by which stressful events affect physical health. The psychoneuroendocrine system can influence the immune response and thereby the capacity of the organism to cope with illness, and the immune system can have an impact on neuroendocrine function. Such cross-talk among systems is dependent upon feedback loops working to maintain homeostatic equilibrium. The immune system is capable of producing factors, which serve to integrate immune-neuroendocrine circuits with immunoregulatory and metabolic consequences for the organism. The interaction of the immune, nervous and endocrine system may drive an individual to a well recognized biological hypersensitivity and the creation of allergic symptoms (allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, etc), followed by distinct behavioural patterns characterized as affective hypersensitivity. Semeiometry is a proper tool for large scale investigation of the psychological profile of patients with allergic rhinitis. Statistical analysis of semeiometry questionnaires processed by Greek adult patients in Crete island during 2005, showed that there is relation between occupation and allergy. Housewives, public services employees and private employees appear to be allergic in significantly higher percentage than others. With semeiometry we can find evidence of the bi-directional immunoendocrine--nervous system interactions in patients with allergic rhinitis.

The red shades of 13 icons (15th-17th century) of the Cretan School of iconography are investigated in detail to identify the inorganic and organic colouring materials comprising the paint layers. Examination of sample cross-sections is performed with optical microscopy. Micro-Raman spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a photodiode array detector are employed for the identification of the inorganic and organic colouring materials, respectively. The results reveal the extensive use of coccid dyes by the Cretan painters: kermes (Kermes vermilio Planchon) is found in icons dated before the middle 16th century and cochineal in icons created several decades after the discovery of the New World. Other dyestuffs detected in the historical samples are madder (possibly Rubia tinctorum L., according to HPLC profiles), soluble redwood and indigoid dyes. Organic dyes were used by the painters as exclusive colouring matters (or glazes) or in mixtures with inorganic pigments, such as red ochre, cinnabar, minium, azurite lead white and carbon black. Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) coupled to a negative electrospray ionization mode is employed to provide information on the identity of some unknown colouring components, of the aforementioned dyes, detected in the historical samples. The results suggest that (i) the type B compound (also known as Bra') is a dehydro-brazilein product and (ii) the deprotonated molecular ion of the type C compound corresponds to m/z - 243. Both compounds are commonly used as markers for the identification of soluble redwood in historical samples. LC-MS analysis of cochineal shows that the dcIV and dcVII components are isomeric with carminic acid, as it has been recently suggested. Finally, LC-MS is employed to identify and record kermesic and flavokermesic acid in kermes and rubiadin in wild madder.

"The concept of ''sense of coherence'' (SOC) was introduced in 1987 by Aaron Antonovsky to describe a dispositional orientation, ''a way of seeing the world'', which is presumed to enhance health. This study reports on the results of the first implementation of SOC in rural Crete and discusses the findings, with a view to the potential impact on primary care delivery in rural Crete. This study forms part of a follow-up project initially established in 1988 in the rural area of Spili, Crete. All participants of the initial study still living in the area (n = 248) were eligible. Data were obtained from 200 subjects (91 males and 109 females) aged 28-92 years, resulting in a second-phase participation rate of 80.7%. The SOC scales (both the SOC-29 and SOC-13 forms) were recorded for 175 (87.1%) of the participants. Comparing the SOC scores among Cretan males and females, there is a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.0001), with men reporting a higher sense of coherence than women, regardless of the form of the questionnaire used. Cretan women seem to score significantly lower than their Swedish counterparts (p &lt; 0.0001), while Cretan men tend to report a higher SOC compared to their matched Swedish reference population (p = 0.07). The study introduces other issues worthy of additional research, particularly with regard to the significantly lower SOC scores obtained by Cretan women, compared to Cretan men. These low SOC scores raise the issue of a potential increase of psychiatric morbidity in the area, leading to a high impact on primary care services. Future investigation into the health impact of SOC factors could be of value to primary care physicians located in rural Crete."

"The frequency of primary systemic small vessel vasculitides (PSV) varies among different geographic regions and age categories. We studied PSV in patients from middle-eastern Crete (Greece), and compared clinical characteristics in younger (&lt;65 years) versus older (&gt; or = 65 years) adult patients. The records of 67 patients (33 younger, 34 older adults) diagnosed with PSV during 1995-2003 who were referred to a mixed secondary/tertiary care University Hospital in Crete were reviewed. Data on clinical manifestations, diagnosis, therapy, and adverse outcomes (end stage renal disease, death) during a median follow-up of 6 (range 0-12) years were recorded. Multivariate regression analysis was applied to identify independent predictors for adverse outcomes. The overall annual incidence of PSV was 19.5/million (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.7-23.4), 48.9/million (95% CI 33.8-63.9) in older and 12.4/million (95% CI 7.7-17) in younger adults. Microscopic polyangiitis was more prevalent in older patients (65%) and Wegener's Granulomatosis in younger patients (52%). Thirty-one percent of older patients developed end-stage renal disease as compared to 11% of younger patients (p=0.103). Mortality rates were 60% in older patients and 19% in younger patients (p=0.001). In multivariate regression analysis age (Beta=0.33 per 1-year, p=0.005), serum creatinine (Beta=0.29 per 1-mg/dL, p=0.011), and lung involvement (Beta=0.36, p=0.002) at the time of diagnosis were independent predictors for end stage renal disease and/or death. This study documents increased frequency and significant mortality of PSV among older people in Crete, with MPA being the most prevalent type. Age, serum creatinine, and lung involvement are important predictors for adverse outcome in these patients."

"Impaired granulopoiesis in chronic idiopathic neutropenia (CIN) has been associated with an inflammatory bone marrow (BM) microenvironment consisting of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, and Fas-Ligand (Fas-L). In this study, we evaluated the frequency of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1 and Fas-L gene polymorphisms in CIN patients and explored their role in excessive cytokine production and their association with CIN development. The TNF-alpha-308G/A, TGF-beta1 -509C/T, +869T/C, +915G/C, and Fas-L -844T/C polymorphisms were studied in 57 CIN patients, and 100 healthy controls from Crete, a well-defined area with genetically homogeneous population, using a polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The mutant genotype C/T or T/T of TGF-beta1 -509C/T polymorphism was more common in CIN patients than in controls (P = 0.033). Compared to wild-type genotype, the TT genotype was associated with increased risk for CIN development (OR: 5.7; 95% CI: 1.18-27.26; P = 0.033). Compared to controls, patients with CT and TT genotypes displayed increased TGF-beta1 levels in serum (P &lt; 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively) and BM (P &lt; 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). No significant difference was found between patients and controls in the frequency of TNF-alpha-308G/A, TGF-beta1 +869T/C and +915G/C and Fas-L -844T/C polymorphisms. The TGF-beta1 -509C/T polymorphism is associated with increased risk for CIN and contributes to the pathophysiology of the disorder by inducing TGF-beta1 overproduction. This is the first study providing evidence that genetic factors may predispose to CIN and may have a role in the pathophysiology of the disorder."

"This study was designed to evaluate whether preoperative chemoradiotherapy reduces the number of lymph nodes harvested after total mesorectal excision of rectal cancer. From January 1995 to December 2007, 168 consecutive patients with rectal cancer underwent total mesorectal excision in the Department of Surgical Oncology at the University of Crete. The patients were divided into three groups (Group A, no chemoradiotherapy; Group B, short course of chemoradiotherapy; Group C, long course of chemoradiotherapy). The primary end points were the number of lymph nodes examined and the percentage of patients with fewer than 12 lymph nodes removed. The overall number of lymph nodes retrieved was not significantly reduced by the use of preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The percentage of patients with fewer than 12 lymph nodes examined, however, was significantly higher in Group C. The leakage rate and the duration of hospital stay were not affected. The rate of wound infections was higher in Group C. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy did not significantly decrease the overall number of lymph nodes retrieved but did increase the percentage of patients with fewer than 12 lymph nodes examined."

The chukar (Alectoris chukar, Galliformes) is a species hunted throughout its native range from the East Mediterranean to Manchuria and in the USA, which hosts the world's largest introduced population. This study aims to investigate the genetic structure of Mediterranean chukar populations to aid management decisions. We genotyped 143 specimens at two regions of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA: cytochrome b, control region) and eight loci of the microsatellite DNA. Samples were collected in northern (Limnos, Lesvos, Chios) and southern (Crete) Aegean islands (Greece) and Cyprus. We also carried out mtDNA-based comparison with chukars (n = 124) from Asia (16 countries) and the USA (five states). We propose six management units for Mediterranean populations. Given their genetic integrity, Limnos and Cyprus, which host different subspecies, proved to be of primary conservation interest. We found exotic A. chukar mtDNA lineages in Lesvos, Chios and Crete and produced definitive genetic evidence for the Asian origin of the US chukars.

"Sex determination is the first essential step for positive identification when a decomposed body is recovered. Taking into consideration the population aspect of sexual dimorphism of the skeleton, the present study aimed to create a sex identification technique using osteometric standards, derived from a contemporary Cretan population. A total of 168 left humeri were measured according to standard osteometric techniques. The differences between the means in males and females were significant (p &lt; 0.0005). About 92.3% of cases were correctly classified when all measurements were applied jointly. Stepwise procedure produced an accuracy rate of 92.9%. The most effective single dimension was vertical head diameter (89.9%). The current study provides standards for a population that has not been represented so far in the existing databases. It demonstrates that the humerus is an effective bone for the estimation of sex because even in a fragmentary state it can give high classification accuracy."

"Few studies have implemented biomarkers of fatty acid intake in relation to breast cancer. To examine possible differences in adipose tissue fatty acid composition between breast cancer patients and healthy control women. The relationship between tumor promotion and adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis was also investigated. The study was conducted at the University of Crete. Subjects included 94 women with clinically diagnosed cancer of the breast and 131 healthy control women. Histological tumor grading and breast cancer staging were assessed. Fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography in gluteal adipose tissue. Conditional logistic regression analysis controlling for potential confounders indicated that elevated adipose monounsaturated fatty acids and oleic acid are associated with reduced odds of breast cancer [OR (T2 vs. T1) 0.15; 95% CI 0.03-0.64, and OR (T2 vs. T1) 0.18; 95% CI 0.04-0.71, respectively]. Adipose myristic acid was associated with an increase in breast cancer risk [OR (T3 vs. T1) 5.66; 95% CI 1.3-23.9]. Adipose oleic acid is inversely related, whereas adipose myristic acid is positively related to breast cancer risk. These relations could be mediated by Her-2/neu and FAS oncogenes."
PMID:19665855	Steyn M, Patriquin ML	Forensic Sci Int. 191(1-3):113.e1-5	2009	Osteometric sex determination from the pelvis--does population specificity matter? 	Sex determination from unknown skeletal remains is of vital importance in forensic anthropology, and much research has been conducted in this field. One of the most commonly used methods is to create discriminant function formulae from metric data. It is widely argued in the literature that these formulae are population-specific, as various populations differ with regard to general body size and degree of sexual dimorphism. However, the population of origin may not always be known, and formulae do not exist for all possible population groups. The aim of this study was to assess whether it is really necessary to develop population-specific formulae for pelvic measurements. For this purpose, skeletons from three different populations namely Greeks living on Crete (n=193), South African whites (n=200) and South African blacks (n=199) were used. Seven standard measurements from the innominate bone were employed and discriminant function formulae developed for each population separately, and then for all three populations combined. Classification accuracies indicate that very little is gained by keeping the populations separate. For example, in a stepwise calculation using all measurements the overall classification accuracy was 94.5% for the combined group, and 94.8%, 94.5% and 94.5% for the Greeks, SA whites and SA blacks respectively. In a direct analysis using pubic and ischial length, the overall combined accuracy was 89.8%, versus 89.3%, 90.0% and 89.0% for the three separate groups. When only the acetabular diameter was used, the corresponding figures were 82.5% versus 84.1%, 81.6% and 83.5%. These results indicate that population-specific formulae may not be necessary for pelvic data, but it should be kept in mind that the pelvis is highly dimorphic. More research is needed, also including other bones of the skeleton.

PMID:19689834	Bellisle F	Public Health Nutr. 12(9A):1644-7	2009	Infrequently asked questions about the Mediterranean diet. 	Numerous health benefits have been attributed to the 'Mediterranean diet' over the last decades. Selecting foods that were common in the Mediterranean regions (especially Crete) in the 1970s, with a frequent and abundant intake of fruit, vegetables, fish, olive oil and perhaps wine, has been reported to be associated with wide-ranging benefits including improved glucose metabolism and decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, obesity and CVD. While the respective contributions of various types of food have been widely investigated, less attention has been paid to other factors, also characteristic of the Mediterranean lifestyle, which may contribute to the health benefits perhaps as much as specific food choices. Traditionally, the Mediterranean diet was consumed in the context of a particular lifestyle, with a fixed number of daily meals, generally consumed at later hours (compared to North of Europe), and some specific meal-related behaviours such as the post-lunch siesta. In addition, the Mediterranean diet and lifestyle that were so beneficial to health, 40 years ago, were considerably different from present-day practices. The changes are particularly clear in younger individuals and countries of the Mediterranean region presently have the highest child overweight rates in Europe. The present paper will address research about meal and satiety patterns and examine how the recent changes from traditional practices are likely to have an impact on health risks and benefits in Mediterranean populations.

"The aim of this work was to develop a simple analytical method to determine the presence of selected pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, and endocrine disruptors in wastewater treatment plant effluents. In this study, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) were used to identify triclosan; 2,4-dichloro phenol; 2,3,4-trichloro phenol; galaxolide; tonalide; estrone; 17-beta-estradiol; 17-alpha-ethinyl estradiol; clofibric acid; and carbamazepine. Extraction parameters such as types of SPME fiber, effect of ionic strength, magnetic stirring, pH, extraction temperature, extraction time, and desorption time were investigated to optimize the SPME-GC method. Also, analytical parameters such as repeatability, linearity, and detection limits were evaluated. The method developed in this study was fast (extraction procedure and GC-MS analysis was around 100 minutes), solvent-free, and low cost. This method was used as a screening test to determine if pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, and endocrine disruptors were present in wastewater treatment plant effluents samples from the Chania Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant in Crete, Greece."

To assess the sources of health information of adolescents in a sample of teenagers from Athens and Crete, Greece. Data were obtained from a convenience sample of 369 adolescents aged 12-18 years from urban areas of Athens and Crete, Greece. Data on health care information sources and overall adolescent health literacy were collected with the use of a questionnaire exploring education on health topics over the past year, sources of health information, and interaction with their physician. More than half the study participants indicated having received information within the past year on oral health, sexually transmitted diseases, physical activity, smoking, and nutrition. The family (71.8%) and the physician (51.5%; boys vs. girls: 44.2% vs. 57.9%, p = .009) are most usually consulted for health information.

The aim of the present study was to test the psychometric properties of the Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0) in a sample of ambulatory cancer patients, mostly low educated and coming from rural areas of the island of Crete. The sample consisted of 188 lung, breast and colorectal cancer patients. Their quality of life (QoL) has been evaluated twice: before and after the first therapeutic intervention. Alpha coefficients ranged from 0.88 to 0.98. Inter-scale correlations were more substantial between the physical, role and fatigue scales. Mean score differences between groups of patients with different performance status (PS) were statistically significant for most of the sub-scales. Instead the patients with stable PS after treatment showed worse functioning in five from the nine sub-scales. For those whose PS has deteriorated, their subjective evaluation indicated deterioration only for physical, role and social functioning. In this sample of mainly ambulatory cancer patients, the instrument has high coefficients of reliability and good clinical validity. However, the results related to its sensitivity are not very consistent. It has proven able to detect clinically significant changes after the therapeutic intervention only for the patients who deteriorated over time and for three specific dimensions of QoL: physical, role and social functioning.

"Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are very interesting markers in identifying population relationships. Moreover, their frequency distribution data are important in the implementation of donor-recipient registry programs for transplantation purposes and also in determining the genetic predisposition for many diseases. For these reasons, we studied the HLA class I and II allele and haplotype frequencies in 160 healthy, unrelated Albanian individuals originating from all regions of the country. The HLA genotyping was performed through a 2-digit resolution SSOP method. The data were analysed with Arlequin and Phylip programs. No deviation was found from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A total of 17 A*, 30 B*, 12 Cw*, 13 DRB1* and 5 DQB1* alleles were identified. The six most frequent HLA-A-B-DRB1 haplotypes were A*02-B*18-DRB1*11 (5.60%), A*02-B*51-DRB1*16 (4.74%), A*01-B*08-DRB1*03 (3.48%), A*24-B*35-DRB1*11 (2.77%), A*02-B*51-DRB1*13 (2.21%), A*24-B*35-DRB1*14 (1.89%).

Maternal fasting serum samples were collected, and blood pressure was measured at the time of the first major ultrasound examination (n = 625). Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used. Women with metabolic syndrome were at high risk for preterm birth (relative risk (RR) = 2.93, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.53, 5.58), with the highest risk observed for medically indicated preterm births (RR = 5.13, 95% CI: 1.97, 13.38). Among the components of metabolic syndrome, the most significant risk factor was hypertension (RR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.28, 4.20). An elevation of 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure increased the relative risk for preterm birth by 29% (RR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.53), while a per unit increase in the low density lipoprotein/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio increased this risk by 19% (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.39). Fetal weight growth restriction was associated with elevated levels of insulin (RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.20) and diastolic blood pressure (RR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.61) in early pregnancy.

"Two irrigation treatments were applied to olive trees of the major commercial Cretan variety cv. Koroneiki, (a) irrigation with 0.4 evaporation class ""A"" pan and (b) rain-feed only, in two successive crop years to assess the effect of irrigation on olive oil quality. Olive fruits were harvested at their semiblack maturity stage. Data obtained indicated that irrigation increased fruit weight and oil content, but the standard quality indices (free fatty acids, peroxide value, K(232), and K(270)) of the oil were not affected significantly. However, irrigation affected some aspects of olive oil composition. There were changes in the proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), triacylglycerol molecular species, sterols, and aliphatic alcohols. Furthermore, the concentrations of the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to 3,4-DHPEA (3,4-DHPEA-EDA) and the isomer of oleuropeine aglycon (3,4-DHPEA-EA) were higher in oils from non-irrigated trees. Tocopherol and total volatiles were higher in the oil produced from the non-irrigated trees. Such oil was graded more pungent when compared to oils produced from fruits of irrigated trees, although both oils were graded satisfactory by consumers."

Quaternary climatic oscillations had dramatic effects on species evolution. In northern latitudes, populations had to survive the coldest periods in refugial areas and recurrently colonized northern regions during interglacials. Such a history usually results in a loss of genetic diversity. Populations that did not experience glaciations, in contrast, probably maintained most of their ancestral genetic diversity. These characteristics dramatically affected the present-day distribution of genetic diversity and may influence the ability of species to cope with the current global changes. We conducted a range-wide study of mitochondrial genetic diversity in the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa/T. wilkinsoni complex, Notodontidae), a forest pest occurring around the Mediterranean Basin and in southern Europe. This species is responding to the current climate change by rapid natural range expansion and can also be accidentally transported by humans. Our aim was to assess if Quaternary climatic oscillations had a different effect across the species' range and to determine if genetic footprints of contemporary processes can be identified in areas of recent introduction. We identified three main clades that were spatially structured. In most of Europe, the genetic diversity pattern was typical for species that experienced marked glaciation cycles. Except in refugia, European populations were characterized by the occurrence of one main haplotype and by a strong reduction in genetic diversity, which is expected in regions that were rapidly re-colonized when climatic conditions improved. In contrast, all other sub-clades around the Mediterranean Basin occurred in limited parts of the range and were strongly structured in space, as is expected in regions in which the impact of glaciations was limited. In such places, genetic diversity was retained in most populations, and almost all haplotypes were endemic. This pattern was extreme on remote Mediterranean islands (Crete, Cyprus, Corsica) where highly differentiated, endemic haplotypes were found. Recent introductions were typified by the existence of closely-related haplotypes in geographically distant populations, which is difficult to detect in most of Europe because of a lack of overall genetic structure. In regions that were not prone to marked glaciations, recent moth introductions/expansions could be detected due to the existence of a strong spatial genetic structure. In contrast, in regions that experienced the most intense Quaternary climatic oscillations, the natural populations are not genetically structured, and contemporary patterns of population expansion remain undetected.

"Association studies of vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms and risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D) have produced inconsistent results in different populations, pointing to contribution of additional genetic variants and environmental factors. In this study we investigated the association between four VDR polymorphisms and susceptibility to T1D in Crete, an island with homogenous population and considerably low incidence of T1D. We genotyped 100 patients with T1D and 96 controls for the FokI (rs10735810), BsmI (rs1544410), ApaI (rs7975232), and TaqI (rs731236) single nucleotide polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In all 4 polymorphisms tested, distribution of VDR genotype frequencies differed significantly between patients and controls. Individuals with T1D presented less commonly with FokI F allele (p=0.008; OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.85) and BsmI B allele (p=0.042; OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97) and more commonly with ApaI A allele (p=0.024; OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.41) and TaqI T allele (p=0.0001; OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.36). Our findings derived from a homogenous southern European population with low incidence of T1D suggest that FokI, BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI polymorphisms of the VDR gene are associated with T1D prevalence."

"Considerable controversy currently exists in the literature concerning the mode of catheter placement and its impact on the technical success of peritoneal dialysis (PD). We decided to compare the impact of the surgical versus the percutaneous insertion technique on peritoneal dialysis catheter (PDCs) complications and survival. Our study population comprised 152 patients in whom 170 PDCs were inserted between January 1990 and December 2007 at the main PD unit on the island of Crete. Eighty four catheters were surgically placed (S group) and 86 were placed percutaneously by nephrologists (N group). The total experience accumulated was 4997 patient-months. The overall complications did not differ between the two groups. Only early leakage was more frequent in N group than S group (10.3 versus 1.9 episodes per 1000 patient-months; p &lt; 0.001). However, it was easily treated and did not constitute a cause of early catheter removal. Catheter survival was 91.1%, 80.7%, and 73.2%, in the S group versus 89.5%, 83.7%, and 83.7% for the N group at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively (p = 0.2). Catheter survival has significantly increased over the last decade. Factors positively affecting PDC survival appeared to be the use of mupirocin for exit site care and the utilization of the coiled type of catheter, practices implemented mainly after 1999. Peritonitis-free survival and patient survival were not associated with the mode of placement, while in Cox regression analysis, were longer in patients treated with automated PD. The placement mode did not affect PD outcomes. Percutaneous implantation proved a safe, simple, low cost, immediately available method for PDC placement and helped to expand our PD program."

"To evaluate mitomycin C (MMC) aqueous humor concentration after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). In this experimental study, twenty-four eyes of 12 male pigmented rabbits were divided into 4 groups and studied at the Institute of Vision and Optics, Department of Medicine, University of Crete, Greece. Eyes in groups 1 and 2 underwent PRK to correct -5 diopters (D) in a 6-mm optical zone, while sponges soaked with 0.02% MMC were applied on the exposed corneal stroma for 60 and 120 seconds, respectively. Similarly, eyes in groups 3 and 4 underwent PRK to correct -10 D in a 6-mm optical zone, while sponges soaked with 0.02% MMC were applied on the exposed corneal stroma for 60 and 120 seconds, respectively. Aqueous humor was extracted from all rabbit eyes 10 minutes after MMC application and high-performance liquid chromatography was performed immediately to detect and quantify MMC levels. The mean aqueous humor concentration of MMC was 0.23+/-0.03 microg/mL, 0.39+/-0.05 microg/mL, 0.28+/-0.04 microg/mL, and 0.52+/-0.16 microg/mL in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The effect of application time and correction on aqueous humor MMC concentration was significant (p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.019), while the exposure time had a greater impact on aqueous humor MMC concentration when compared with the attempted correction. Both exposure time of MMC on the corneal stroma and the attempted correction was correlated with MMC aqueous humor concentrations."

A cross-sectional study in two Mediterranean settings. 	"Numerous studies have identified a reduced health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients with urinary incontinence (UI). The aim of this study was to assess and compare QoL in women with UI in the island of Crete, Greece, and in Turkey. Incontinent women from two community-based primary health care (PHC) groups (Greece and Turkey) and one outpatient clinic-based group were studied. A total of 231 (24.7%) women out of 932 women from the PHC group in Greece and Turkey reported UI whereas another 38 incontinent women visited the secondary care outpatient clinic. Mean Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire (I-QoL) total score of women visiting PHC centers was 73.8 (SD = 23.5). There was significant difference among the three groups regarding I-QoL total and subscale scores, with women from the Greek community-based group having the highest score (mean = 81.8, SD = 20.7, P &lt; 0.001). Impaired QoL was significantly associated with severity (P &lt; 0.001), incontinence type (P = 0.026), seeking secondary care, and Turkey as sample setting (P &lt; 0.001). Urinary incontinence is a frequent problem for women visiting PHC centers, affecting negatively their quality of life. Besides incontinence severity, Turkey as place of residence emerged as another essential predictor of impaired quality of life, suggesting that other social and cultural factors may also play an important role."

"The objective of the present study was to determine whether or not maternal metabolic syndrome in early pregnancy in women without previous diabetes is associated with the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A total of 508 women from the Rhea study-involving a pregnant cohort in Crete, Greece (2007-2009)-with singleton pregnancies were included in the present analysis. Maternal fasting serum samples were collected and blood pressure measured before gestational week 15. The metabolic syndrome in early pregnancy was defined according to NHLBI/AHA criteria. Pregnant women were screened for GDM between weeks 24 and 28 of gestation, as defined by Carpenter and Coustan criteria. Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the effect of the metabolic syndrome in early pregnancy on the risk of GDM, after adjusting for confounding factors. Women with the metabolic syndrome were at high risk of GDM (RR=3.17; 95% CI: 1.06-9.50). Among the components of the metabolic syndrome, the most significant risk factors were impaired fasting glucose (RR=4.92; 95% CI: 1.41-17.23) and pre-pregnancy obesity (RR=2.65; 95% CI: 1.23-5.70). A 10-mmHg rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased the relative risk of GDM by 49% (RR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.10-2.02) and 34% (RR=1.34; 95% CI: 1.04-1.73), respectively, whereas a 1-unit increase in pre-pregnancy BMI increased the relative risk of GDM by 6% (RR=1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.12). These findings suggest that women with the metabolic syndrome in early pregnancy have a greater risk of developing GDM."

"The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of rhinitis medicamentosa (RM) in patients attending the ENT outpatient clinic of the General Hospital of Rethymnon (Crete, Greece) before and after the launch of an intensive nasal decongestant advertising campaign in Greece. We reviewed the medical records of the patients with RM seen at the ENT outpatient clinic in May, June and July of 2003 and 2006. We analyzed and recorded the gender, age, and related clinical information of the patients with RM. In May, June and July of 2003, 41 patients out of a total of 1780 patients attending the ENT outpatient clinic were diagnosed with RM (2.3%). In the same months in 2006, 161 patients out a total of 1898 patients were diagnosed with RM (8.5%). The frequency of RM in these groups was therefore found to have increased significantly between 2003 and 2006. In 2006, 8 out of 10 patients with RM reported that they had made their purchasing decision solely on the basis of the information supplied by the drug advertisement without consulting their doctor or pharmacist. We suggest that the intensive media advertising campaign for nasal topical decongestants (particularly on TV) which started in 2004 is probably the main reason for this ""endemic"" RM."

A primary care pilot study in rural Crete, Greece. 	"The burden of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) on the general health and well-being of the population has been documented in various studies. The objective of this study was to explore the association between MSD and the quality of life and mental health of patients and to discuss issues concerning care seeking patterns in rural Greece. Patients registered at one rural Primary Care Centre (PCC) in Crete were invited to complete the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) for the analysis of musculoskeletal symptoms, together with validated instruments for measuring health related quality of life (SF-36) and mental distress (GHQ-28). The prevalence rate of MSD was found to be 71.2%, with low back and knee pain being the most common symptoms. Most conditions significantly impaired the quality of life, especially the physical dimensions of SF-36. Depression was strongly correlated to most MSD (p &lt; 0.001). Multiple logistic analyses revealed that patients who consulted the PCC due to MSD were likely to have more mental distress or impaired physical functioning compared to those who did not. Musculoskeletal disorders were common in patients attending the rural PCC of this study and were associated with a poor quality of life and mental distress that affected their consultation behaviour."

A child experiencing an event of threatening or catastrophic nature may experience considerable post-traumatic psychological distress. Dog bites present an important public health problem and are a frequent cause of physical trauma in children. Physicians who manage paediatric trauma may not be vigilant of the high risk of psychological stress in children exposed to a physical injury. A 4-year-old white girl of Greek origin, with a dog-bite related trauma was admitted to the University Hospital of Crete, Greece, for surgical repair and intravenous antibiotic therapy due to extensive lesions. Exposure to the traumatic event triggered the onset of an unusual psychological response, selective mutism and acute post-traumatic stress disorder. There is limited literature discussing the psychological effect of dog bites in children. Parents and physicians involved in pediatric physical trauma need to be more familiar with post-traumatic behavioral reactions. Awareness of the potential development of such reactions may result in early detection and effective management of children at risk.

"The aim of the present work was to evaluate various socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle and psychological characteristics of elderly (&gt; 65 years) and very elderly (&gt; 90 years) individuals without known cardiovascular disease. During 2005-7, 1190 elderly (aged &gt; 65) men and women (from Cyprus, Mitilini, Samothraki, Cephalonia, Crete, Lemnos, Corfu and Zakynthos) were randomly enrolled. Socio-demographic, clinical, psychological and lifestyle factors were assessed using standard questionnaires and procedures. From all islands, the proportion of males aged 65-80, 80-90 and &gt; 90 years was 71.8, 24.8 and 3.4%, respectively. The proportion of women, for the same age categories, was 80.4, 17.9 and 1.7%, respectively. Walking and other activities significantly declined with age (P &lt; 0.001); however, nearly one in five participants over the age of 90 years remained physically active. Current smoking significantly declined in males as age increased (P &lt; 0.001). All participants above the age of 90 years reported sleeping at noon. The proportion of participants living alone differs significantly (P &lt; 0.001) across the three age groups. However, considerably more women live alone (men vs. women living alone: aged 65-80 years 12 vs. 37%; 80-90 years 16 vs. 55%; &gt; 90 years 52 vs. 55%). Dietary characteristics of The Mediterranean Islands Study (MEDIS) sample display a favourable adherence to dietary recommendations (Mediterranean diet). A favourable adherence to the Mediterranean diet, mid-day naps and smoking cessation with an increase in age was characteristic of our elderly population. Future research should further evaluate whether the aforementioned characteristics are associated with longevity beyond the average life expectancy."

The early detection of cervical cancer with a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear has resulted in a great decline of mortality rates in developed countries, a progress suggesting that general practice may have a crucial role in promoting screening. This study explores the impact of general practitioners on women's adherence to Pap screening recommendations in a rural area of Crete, Greece. A cross-sectional study was conducted during 2006 in a rural area of 3,000 inhabitants, where access to primary care is free of charge. A random sample of 120 women (response rate=97.5%) aged 35-75 years were interviewed about Pap smear uptake within 6 years and the influence of health professionals on their screening intentions. Adequate screening was defined according to the American Cancer Society guidelines. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to estimate odds ratios. About 40.8% of the respondents had been screened according to the guidelines. However, only 10.8% were recommended to have a Pap smear within the last year and 4.2% were informed about human papilloma virus. Having visited the primary care clinics for prevention or the availability of a general practitioner to consult regularly did not affect the likelihood of being screened. Both the adequate and occasional screening rates were positively associated with a history of gynecological problems and with age less than 55 years. No disparities were observed regarding socio-economic status. Despite free provision of primary care, current preventive practice has not influenced women's screening behavior. National policy to support organized cancer screening and physician' training are necessary for effective early detection of cancer.

Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a significant threat to the fetus. We examined the association between active maternal smoking and smoking cessation during early pregnancy with newborn somatometrics and adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm delivery, low birth weight, and fetal growth restriction. One thousand four hundred mother-child pairs with extensive questionnaire data were followed up until delivery, within the context of a population-based mother-child cohort study (Rhea study), in Crete, Greece, 2007-2008. Comparing smokers to nonsmokers, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 2.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7, 4.6] for low birth weight and 2.6 (95%CI: 1.6, 4.2) for fetal growth restriction. This corresponded to a 119-g reduction in birth weight, a 0.53-cm reduction in length, and a 0.35-cm reduction in head circumference. Smoking cessation early during pregnancy modified significantly these pregnancy outcomes indicating the necessity for primary smoking prevention.

"To evaluate the effectiveness of the BC Children's Hospital (BCCH) Safe Start Choking Prevention campaign, which began in 2002 and used newspaper, magazine, radio, and television interviews of parents, injury prevention experts, and physicians to educate the public about choking risks, prevention, and treatment (CRPT); to compare our campaign with other campaigns; and to determine if a new strategy is needed to educate the public about CRPT. A retrospective analysis of the number of cases of laryngeal, bronchial, and esophageal foreign bodies (LBEFBs) that required rigid endoscopy under general anesthesia at BCCH and/or admission to BCCH was conducted. Data from January 1997 to December 2002 to January 2003 to December 2006 were compared. The world literature on choking prevention and analysis of barriers to CRPT public education was reviewed. The data demonstrate the ineffectiveness of our traditional media campaign. The number of total operating room visits at BCCH for LBEFBs increased marginally after our choking prevention campaign began. Published reports from Israel and Crete indicate that educational campaigns that included direct teaching of CRPT by otolaryngologists and other health educators to parents and their children are effective; however, such campaigns would be difficult to replicate within larger populations. A new strategy for CPRT public education is required. We are creating an animated video and a comprehensive, interactive website to teach CRPT to preteens, teenagers, and adults (with prospective validation of knowledge transfer and long-term outcome measurement)."

To study clinical features of patient presented with severe hydramnios, associated with hydronephrosis, that was antenatally diagnosed and has been successfully treated immediately after birth. At a molecular level, we investigated the gene expression of key steroidogenic enzymes from the maternal ovary. Ultrasound scan, MRI, semi-quantitative RT-PCR SETTING: The patient was admitted to the University Hospital, University of Crete, Medical School, Greece, where all clinical data has been obtained. Gene expression studies took place at Biosciences, Brunel University, UK. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that there is upregulation of key steroidogenic genes in the maternal ovary, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, and the cytochrome P450 heme-containing proteins CYP11A, CYP17 and CYP19. From a clinical perspective, the prenatal ultrasound scan and MRI findings showed a multicystic pelvic mass, bilateral hydronephrosis and prior to delivery severe polyhydramnios. This clinical case is the only one that we have found in the current literature where congenital imperforate hymen accompanied with hematocolpos is associated with renal obstruction in combination with polyhydramnios and increase in maternal steroidogenic enzymes.

"Musculoskeletal pain is associated with occupational physical activities and psychosocial risk factors. We evaluated the relative importance of work-related and psychological determinants of the number of -anatomical sites affected by musculoskeletal pain in a cross-sectional survey. The survey focused on musculoskeletal pain in six body regions (low-back, neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist-hand, and knee) among 224 nurses, 200 office workers and 140 postal clerks in Crete, Greece (response rate 95%). Information was collected about demographic characteristics, occupational physical load, psycho-social aspects of work, perceptions about the causes of pain, mental health, somatization, and experience of pain in the past 12 months. We used Poisson regression to assess associations of risk factors with the number of painful anatomical sites and explored interactions using classification and regression trees (CART). Two-thirds of the study sample reported pain in &gt;or=2 body sites during the past 12 months, and in 23%, &gt;3 sites were affected. The number of painful anatomical sites was strongly related to both physical load at work and somatization (with relative risks increased 5-fold or more for frequent and disabling multisite pain) and was also significantly associated with work-related psychosocial factors and beliefs about work causation. The CART analysis suggested that somatization was the leading determinant of the number of painful body sites. In the population studied, pain at multiple anatomical sites was common and strongly associated with somatization, which may have a more important influence on multisite pain than pain that is limited to a single anatomical site."

The advancing antimicrobial drug resistance among Enterobacteriaceae renders the evaluation of potential novel therapeutic options necessary. We sought to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility to fosfomycin and 12 additional antibiotics of MDR Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected between November 2007 and April 2009 at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, was examined using the Etest method. A total of 152 MDR Enterobacteriaceae isolates were studied, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (76.3%), Escherichia coli (17.1%), Proteus mirabilis (4.6%) and other species (2.0%). Antimicrobial susceptibility rates were highest for fosfomycin (92.8%), tigecycline (92.1%) and colistin (73.0%) followed by imipenem (35.5%), tetracycline (20.4%), gentamicin (19.7%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (12.5%) and ciprofloxacin (10.5%). Of the 152 isolates, 85 (55.9%) were extensively drug-resistant (XDR), of which 78 (91.8%) remained susceptible to fosfomycin. Susceptibility to fosfomycin of the 79 carbapenemase-producing, 34 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and 24 metallo-beta-lactamase-producing isolates was 94.9%, 94.1% and 83.3%, respectively. In conclusion, in this study fosfomycin exhibited good in vitro antimicrobial activity against MDR and XDR Enterobacteriaceae. We suggest further evaluation of the potential clinical utility of fosfomycin against infections caused by these pathogens.

Recent whole-genome and candidate-gene association studies in patients with psoriasis (PS) have identified a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that predispose to disease with moderate risk. Predisposition to PS is known to be affected by genetic variation in human leukocyte antigen-C as well as other non-human leukocyte antigen genes. We recently reported for the first time as a PS-associated SNP the signal transducer and activator of transcription-4 (STAT4) rs7574865 polymorphism, which is also associated with several autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to assess whether the functional R620W polymorphism of protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene encoding the lymphoid-specific tyrosine phosphatase, which is known to be associated with various autoimmune diseases, also confers increased risk for PS in the genetic homogeneous population of Crete. A case-control study was performed with 173 PS patients consecutively recruited and 348 healthy controls, all of them from the island of Crete. We found that the mutated T allele of the PTPN22 1858T SNP was more common in control individuals than in patients with PS (odds ratio = 0.39, 95% confidence interval = 0.11-1.04, p = 0.09). No considerable difference was observed in terms of sex, age of onset, or clinical presentation of psoriatic arthritis. Our results provide evidence that the PTPN22 1858T allele is not a susceptibility factor for PS in the Cretan population.

Careful review of published evidence has led to the postulate that the degree of lumbar lordosis may possibly influence the development and progression of spinal osteoarthritis, just as misalignment does in other joints. Spinal degeneration can ensue from the asymmetrical distribution of loads. The resultant lesions lead to a domino- like breakdown of the normal morphology, degenerative instability and deviation from the correct configuration. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a relationship exists between the sagittal alignment of the lumbar spine, as it is expressed by lordosis, and the presence of radiographic osteoarthritis. 112 female subjects, aged 40-72 years, were examined in the Outpatients Department of the Orthopedics' Clinic, University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete. Lumbar radiographs were examined on two separate occasions, independently, by two of the authors for the presence of osteoarthritis. Lordosis was measured from the top of L1 to the bottom of L5 as well as from the top of L1 to the top of S1. Furthermore, the angle between the bottom of L5 to the top of S1 was also measured. 49 women were diagnosed with radiographic osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine, while 63 women had no evidence of osteoarthritis and served as controls. The two groups were matched for age and body build, as it is expressed by BMI. No statistically significant differences were found in the lordotic angles between the two groups There is no difference in lordosis between those affected with lumbar spine osteoarthritis and those who are disease free. It appears that osteoarthritis is not associated with the degree of lumbar lordosis.
PMID:20046857	Yngve A	Am J Lifestyle Med. 3(1 Suppl.):35S-38S	2009	A Historical Perspective of the Understanding of the Link between Diet and Coronary Heart Disease. 	The development of the understanding of the underlying causes of coronary heart disease has undergone several stages. Ecological studies, such as the Seven Countries' Study, showed a possible relationship between mortality in coronary heart disease and intake of saturated fats. The investigated area with the lowest rates of cardiovascular disease was the island of Crete, Greece. A discussion soon started to evolve around the Mediterranean diet, which at the time consisted of mainly foods of vegetable origin, olive oil and cereals of unrefined nature. Several clinical trials have been undertaken since, including the Lyon Heart Diet Study where it was clearly shown that both mortality and morbidity in coronary heart disease was substantially lowered by Mediterranean food compared to controls. Dean Ornish proved that an extreme regimen actually could reduce already existing sclerotic plaques, while the WHI study showed that a more modest diet change diet not cause the intended reduction in heart disease in middle-aged women. Another prospective study of a similar age group of women showed that a diet with a low glycemic load gave a good reduction in coronary heart disease. Multiple studies of different components of food have shown no positive result, pointing at the whole diet rather than its components of nutrients being of importance. Today, the experts agree on the optimal diet to prevent not only heart disease but also cancer forms and other chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. This diet is consisting of a lot of fruit and vegetables, lots of fish, less salt and sugar, more unrefined cereals, beans and nuts. Going from a general notion of Mediterranean food to testing that food in clinical settings and testing nutrients as preventative agents, we can conclude that a generally healthy lifestyle, including a healthy diet, appropriate amounts of physical activity, good sleep and less stress, is the way to a heart healthy life.

"The aim of the current study was to assess the reliability and validity of the Greek translation of the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST), for use in primary care settings. The scale consists of 10 items and is a brief clinician rating scale for the detection of anxiety disorder in older people, particularly, in the presence of depression. The study was performed in two rural primary care settings in Crete. The sample consisted of 99 older (76 +/- 6.3 years old) people, who fulfilled the participating criteria. The translation and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire was performed according to international standards. Internal consistency using the Cronbach alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the reliability of the tool. An exploratory factor analysis using Varimax with Kaiser normalisation (rotation method) was used to examine the structure of the instrument, and for the correlation of the items interitem correlation matrix was applied and assessed with Cronbach alpha. Translation and backtranslation did not reveal any specific problems. The psychometric properties of the Greek version of the SAST scale in primary care were good. Internal consistency of the instrument was good, the Cronbach alpha was found to be 0.763 (P &lt;0.001) and ICC (95% CI) for reproducibility was found to be 0.763 (0.686 to 0.827). Factor analysis revealed three factors with eigenvalues &gt;1.0 accounting for 60% of variance, while the Cronbach alpha was &gt;0.7 for every item. The Greek translation of the SAST questionnaire is comparable with that of the original version in terms of reliability, and can be used in primary healthcare research. Its use in clinical practice should be primarily as a screening tool only at this stage, with a follow-up consisting of a detailed interview with the patient, in order to confirm the diagnosis."

People in Greece, especially those living in rural areas, frequently consume various plants and herbs as a vegetable meal or as a herbal remedy, which can lead to a number of adverse reactions. These two case reports resulted in a prolonged hospitalisation due to severe and persistent supraventricular tachycardia caused by a vegetable meal. These case reports describe two cases of accidentally use of Mandragora Officinarum identified within the same Greek family, which resulted in hospitalisation. A 47-year-old Greek Caucasian woman and a 48-year-old Greek Caucasian male presented to the local primary care centre with nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, headache and dryness of mouth. Due to serious supraventricular tachycardia, the two patients were hospitalised in the intensive care unit of a nearby hospital for a week. These case reports highlight the importance of ensuring that primary care physicians are aware of the possible effects of mandragora use, for cases when they are involved in the treatment of patients presenting with similar symptoms as those discussed below.

"We report infection of Brindley sacral anterior root stimulator in a spinal cord injury patient, who ultimately required removal of the implant. The consequences of failed implantation were severe constipation, and loss of reflex penile erection and bladder emptying. A male patient, born in 1973, fell off the balcony while on holidays in Crete in 1993 and developed complete tetraplegia at C-5 level. In 1996, deafferentation of sacral nerve roots 2, 3 and 4 were carried out bilaterally. Brindley sacral anterior root stimulator was implanted. On eleventh post-operative day, blood stained fluid came out of sacral wound. Microbiology of exudates showed growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sensitive to gentamicin. As discharge of serosanguinous fluid persisted, sacral wound was explored. In March 1997, induration and craggy swelling were noted at the site of receiver. There was discharge from the surgical wound in the back. Wound swab grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The receiver was taken out. Cables were retrieved and tunnelled in left flank. Laminectomy wound was left open. In May 1997, cables were removed from left flank through the laminectomy wound. Grommet was sliced down as much as possible without producing leak of cerebrospinal fluid. Histoacryl glue was used over the truncated grommet as a sealing agent. Microbiology of end of S-2 and S-3 cables showed growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was sensitive to gentamicin. End of S-4 cable showed scanty growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella aerogenes. Review of this patient in January 1999 revealed presence of sinuses in dorsal wound exuding purulent material. The wound was explored; grommet and electrodes were removed. The consequences of failed implantation were severe constipation and loss of reflex penile erection and bladder emptying. This patient had to spend increasing amount of time for bowels management. Faecal incontinence limited his mobility. The problem with his bowels was affecting his confidence in doing anything, as the slightest movement could cause his bowels to work. The inconvenience and embarrassment of a bowel accident caused distress to the patient and to his mother. This case illustrates that bacterial infection is a major problem in spinal cord injury patients who undergo implantation of medical devices. Further, this case underlines the need for honest discussion with spinal cord injury patients about possible complications of implantation of sacral anterior root stimulator and long-term consequences of an unsuccessful operation."

The objective of this work is to analyze and identify the diterpene compounds in Mediterranean propolis samples from different Greek regions by GC-MS. The chemical composition of six propolis samples was established using previously isolated diterpenes from Cretan propolis as authentic standards for identification, based on mass spectral fragmentation of the TMS derivatives and retention index. More than 30 diterpenes, among which were new propolis constituents, were identified and characterized by means of authentic standards and interpretation of MS fragmentation as well. This is the first detailed profiling of a new type of propolis, rich in diterpenes. The chromatographic and mass- spectral characteristics of the diterpenes identified could be very useful for rapid GC-MS profiling of this propolis type and for revealing its plant sources.

Serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) function has been associated with human cardiovascular disease. The projected mechanism postulates interaction of PON1 with lipoproteins and insulin signaling resulting in alterations in lipid homeostasis. Recently, PON2 was shown to directly regulate triglyceride accumulation in macrophages and PON1 was detected in the interstitial space of adipocytes. The aims of the present study were a) to examine the relationship of the PON1 function with serum parameters related to lipid homeostasis, and b) to examine a possible role of PON1 in the regulation of lipid composition in the human adipose tissue. Two important genetic variations with functional impact on PON1 activity in humans are the Q192R and the L55M. The present study evaluated the impact of the Q192R and the L55M polymorphisms in a cross-section of the population on the island of Crete, as regards to PON1 activity, plasma lipids/lipoproteins, parameters of the metabolic syndrome, and the fatty acid composition of the adipose tissue. We detected a significant association of the polymorphisms with blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, serum iron, and homocysteine. Furthermore, a novel function is suggested for PON1 on the fatty acid composition in the adipose tissue through the positive association of the R allele with saturated fatty acid and of the Q allele with 20:5n3 fatty acid deposition.

Among target pests of the insecticide spinosad is the olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera: Tephritidae). In Cyprus, spinosad has been sporadically used since its registration in 2002, whereas in Greece its use has been very limited since its registration in 2004, particularly in biological olive cultivars in Crete. By contrast, in California it has been the only insecticide used against the olive fruit fly since its registration in 2004. This study aimed at examining the resistance status of the olive fruit fly to spinosad. Populations from California, Greece and Cyprus, plus a laboratory population, were tested. Bioassays were performed by oral or topical application of different concentrations of the insecticide. Cypriot populations demonstrated no resistance as compared with that of the laboratory population. Among the Greek populations, only one from Crete demonstrated a fourfold increase in resistance, whereas five populations from California demonstrated a 9-13-fold increase. The observed resistance increase was associated with spinosad applications in the respective areas. These values are relatively low and do not yet pose a serious control problem in the field. However, the observed variation documents that spinosad tolerance has increased in areas where the insecticide has been more extensively used.

To evaluate the leading indications for penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and their trends in Greece during the period 1982 to 2006. Retrospective data review of 1,929 patients (2233 eyes) who underwent PKP in the period between 1982 and 2006 at three cornea transplantation units of three hospitals in Greece (Athens General Hospital, Heraklion University Hospital of Crete, and Thessaloniki University Hospital). Indications were classified into nine different groups: keratoconus, herpes simplex keratitis, microbial (nonviral) keratitis (fungal, bacterial, and acanthamoeba), aphakic/pseudophakic corneal edema, posttraumatic corneal scars, chemical/thermal injury, regraft, Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy, and other. The leading indications for PKP, in order of decreasing frequency, were aphakic/pseudophakic corneal edema (n = 649 [29.1%]), keratoconus (n = 580 [26%]), regraft (n = 265 [11.9%]), microbial (nonviral) keratitis (n = 188 [8.4%]), posttraumatic corneal scar (n = 171 [7.7%]), herpes simplex keratitis (n = 104 [4.6%]), Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy (n = 104 [4.6%]), chemical/thermal injury (n = 61 [2.7%]), and other (n = 111 [5%]). The prevalence of regrafts as an indication for PKP increased during the study period. Aphakic/pseudophakic corneal edema was the most common indication for PKP in a multicenter series in Greece followed by keratoconus. The number of regrafts dramatically increased during the 25-year period.

"Whereas firearm suicide mortality has been a longstanding public concern worldwide, in Greece no systematic analysis has been reported so far despite the recent evidence of a rising rate of gun ownership. To estimate the proportion of firearm suicides on the island of Crete, Southern Greece, well-known for its widespread gun ownership; to describe the victims' sociodemographic profile and firearm-related suicide variables; and to assess the severity of suicidal intention in the group. Records of suicides between 1999 and 2007 were reviewed and information was extracted into a computerized database. A rating of the circumstances section of the Beck's Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) for each case was also performed. The firearm suicide rate was 1.3 per 100,000, with males constituting the vast majority. These men were more likely to be less than 55 years of age, to have lived in the western part of the island, to have some degree of planning prior to the suicidal act, and to have used a shotgun, but less likely to have left a note. As an important first step toward implementing preventive initiatives the authors stress the need for a thorough look at the sociocultural factors associated with firearms in the region."

Although seabirds have been proposed as useful biomonitors for organochlorine contaminants (OCs) in marine environments, their suitability is still unclear. To understand the geographic variability and the influence of seabird trophic ecology in OC levels, we analyzed PCBs, DDTs, delta(13)C, and delta(15)N in the blood of adult Calonectris shearwaters throughout a vast geographic range within the northeast Atlantic Ocean (from Cape Verde to Azores) and the Mediterranean Sea (from the Alboran Sea to Crete). OC concentrations were greater in birds from the Mediterranean than in those from the Atlantic colonies, showing higher and lower chlorinated PCB profiles, respectively. This large-scale pattern may reflect the influence of historical European runoffs in the Mediterranean basin and diffused sources for OCs in remote Atlantic islands. Spatial patterns also emerged within the Atlantic basin, probably associated with pollutant long-range transport and recent inputs of DDT in the food webs of shearwaters from Cape Verde and the Canary islands. Moreover, a positive association of OC concentrations with delta(15)N within each locality points out diet specialization as a major factor explaining differences in OCs at the intraspecific level. Overall, this study highlights wide range breeding seabirds, such as Calonectris shearwaters, as suitable organisms for biomonitoring large geographic trends of organochlorine contamination in the marine environment.

"We aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against Gram-positive non-urinary isolates collected at the microbiological laboratory of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, in 2008. Susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method for a total of 1846 isolates; 1275 isolates (69.1%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. Specifically, 416/419 Staphylococcus aureus (99.3%) [including 129/130 meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates] and 745/961 coagulase-negative staphylococci (77.5%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. Among 42 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 64 Streptococcus pyogenes and 93 other streptococcal isolates, 61.9%, 40.6% and 48.4%, respectively, were susceptible to fosfomycin. Fosfomycin was inactive against the 166 enterococcal isolates tested. This old antibiotic may deserve consideration for further studies and use in clinical practice, especially for S. aureus (including MRSA) infections."

This study investigated if atmospheric ammonia (NH3) pollution around a sheep farm influences the photosynthetic performance of the lichens Evernia prunastri and Pseudevernia furfuracea. Thalli of both species were transplanted for up to 30 days in a semi-arid region (Crete, Greece), at sites with concentrations of atmospheric ammonia of ca. 60 microg/m3 (at a sheep farm), ca. 15 microg/m3 (60 m from the sheep farm) and ca. 2 microg/m3 (a remote area 5 km away). Lichen photosynthesis was analysed by the chlorophyll a fluorescence emission to identify targets of ammonia pollution. The results indicated that the photosystem II of the two lichens exposed to NH(3) is susceptible to this pollutant in the gas-phase. The parameter PI(ABS), a global index of photosynthetic performance that combines in a single expression the three functional steps of the photosynthetic activity (light absorption, excitation energy trapping, and conversion of excitation energy to electron transport) was much more sensitive to NH3 than the FV/FM ratio, one of the most commonly used stress indicators.

"Our objective was to study multiple sclerosis on Crete, an island of 0.6 million inhabitants sharing a similar genetic background and the same environment. Case ascertainment was achieved using the MS Epidemiology Program Project of Crete. The diagnosis and classification of multiple sclerosis were made by established clinical and magnetic resonance imaging criteria, and disease evolution was assessed by periodic evaluations. Thorough clinical and laboratory evaluations were conducted; a detailed history, including a questionnaire of 36 items, was taken. Data obtained were analysed for possible interaction with disease prognosis. We identified 587 cases of multiple sclerosis (F:M = 1.6), &gt;90% of which were of Cretan origin from both parental lines. Age at onset was 31.5 +/- 10.3 years (mean +/- SD) and disease duration 12.7 +/- 9.1 years. About 84.6% had relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, 9.4% primary progressive multiple sclerosis and 6% clinically isolated syndrome. Nearly 40% of our multiple sclerosis patients with disease duration &gt;10 years (mean = 16.2 +/- 5.3 years) remained with no or mild disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] &lt; or =3). Also, about 30% of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis showed benign disease evolution (EDSS &lt; or =3) more than 20 years (mean = 24.0 +/- 3.3) after onset. Factors predisposing to benign multiple sclerosis included younger age at onset, shorter disease duration and a lower number of relapses. We conclude that a substantial proportion of patients with multiple sclerosis from Crete follow a rather benign disease course, and this may relate to the genetic background of the population and/or to environmental factors."

"Dietary fats have long been associated with human health, and especially cardiovascular disease (CVD). Some observational studies have shown that reduction in dietary fats, and particularly cholesterol is associated with lower cardiovascular risk; however, other prospective studies or randomized controlled trials of dietary fat reduction or modification have shown varying results on CVD morbidity and mortality. In this work we evaluated the relationships between dietary fats and a cluster of CVD risk factors (i.e., diabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension), among elderly individuals without known CVD. In particular, dietary and clinical data from 1486 elderly (aged 65 to 100 years) men and women living in Cyprus, Mitilini, Samothraki, Cephalonia, Crete, Lemnos, Syros, Naxos, Corfu and Zakynthos islands, and participated in the MEDIS study, were analysed. Data analysis revealed that 18.5% of males and 33.3% of females had three or four cardiovascular disease risk factors; the major source of fat was olive oil (mean intake for men and women 50.0 +/- 19.3 g/day and 46.0 +/- 16.8 g/day, p &lt; 0.001). In addition it was observed that a 5% increase in energy adjusted fat intake from meat was associated with a 21% increase in the likelihood of having one additional CVD risk factor (95%CI 6%-39%); no significant associations were observed regarding the other types of fat consumed by the elderly participants. These findings may state a hypothesis that the consumption of fat only from meat or its products seems to increase the burden of CVD risk factors among CVD-free, elderly people."

Cross-sectional. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was measured by the MedDietScore (range: 0-55), whereas SES was estimated using education and financial status. During 2005-2007, 300 men and women from Cyprus, 100 from Samothraki, 142 from Mitilini, 114 from Kefalonia, 131 from Crete, 150 from Lemnos, 150 from Corfu and 103 from Zakynthos (aged 65-100 years), free of known chronic diseases, participated in the survey. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that belonging to the highest SES was associated with a higher MedDietScore (P &lt; 0.01), after adjusting for potential sociodemographic, lifestyle, dietary and clinical confounders. A significant positive association was also found between MedDietScore and years of school (P = 0.004), as well as financial status (P = 0.001). Older Greek people of higher SES seem to follow a relatively healthier diet. Both education and income seem to play a role in this issue. Thus, public health policy makers should focus on people with low SES in order to improve their quality of diet and, consequently, their health status."

Hip fracture patients have lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, at the time of their fracture, compared to age-matched controls. Aim of this work was to examine if the admission levels of serum 25(OH)D in patients with hip fracture are associated not only to hip fracture in general but also to the type of hip fracture, i.e., trochanteric vs. cervical. Our hypothesis was based on the fact that in Mediterranean countries trochanteric hip fractures are more common than cervical while the contrary is true for northern European countries. Fifty-three community free elderly Cretan women with an acute low energy hip fracture (29 with trochanteric and 24 with cervical fracture) and 70 community free elderly women without hip fracture were included in this study. Serum PTH, Ca, P and Cre showed no significant difference between the two fracture groups. Women with trochanteric fractures had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D levels compared to those with cervical hip fracture (i.e., 35.9 nmol/l vs 55.2 nmol/l (p=0.015) while the group of those with cervical hip fracture do not appear to differ from the controls.

This systematic review assesses the effectiveness and safety of dietary interventions for rheumatoid arthritis. Randomized controlled trials comparing any dietary manipulation with an ordinary diet were included. Eight randomized controlled trials with a total of 366 patients were included. One trial found that fasting, followed by 13 months on a vegetarian eating plan, might reduce pain (mean difference on a zero to 10 scale -1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.62 to -0.16). Another single trial found that a 12-week Cretan Mediterranean eating plan might reduce pain (mean difference on a 0 to 100 scale -14.00, 95% CI -23.6 to -4.37). Due to inadequate data reporting, the effects of vegan eating plans and elimination diets are uncertain. When comparing any dietary manipulation with an ordinary diet we found a higher total drop-out of 8% (risk difference 0.08, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.17), higher treatment-related drop-out of 5% (risk difference 0.05, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.14) and a significantly higher weight loss (weighted mean difference -3.24, 95% CI -4.81 to -1.67 kg) in the diet groups compared to the control groups. The effects of dietary manipulation, including vegetarian, Mediterranean, and elemental eating plans, and elimination diets on rheumatoid arthritis are still uncertain due to the included studies being small, single trials with moderate to high risk of bias. We conclude that higher dropout rates and weight loss in the groups with dietary manipulation indicate that potential adverse effects should not be ignored.

The new haplotypes identified in Crete converge with those of specimens collected in northern Turkey, Thrace and Macedonia/Calcydia: this allows to suggest a unique genetic lineage for the Aegean area. A taxonomic and phylogenetic re-analysis of the Reticulitermes genus in Mediterranean Europe agrees with the species rank suggested for Reticulitermes balkanensis and Reticulitermes urbis, as well as for Reticulitermes banyulensis and Reticulitermes grassei from France and the Iberian peninsula. A level of divergence compatible with a specific rank of differentiation is scored also among the three Reticulitermes lucifugus subspecies from Italy and Corse, with the Sardo-Corsican entity basal to the other taxa. In the eastern area, the ""Aegean"" entity, including the Cretan lineages, results the most apical clade while R. urbis, distributed along the East Adriatic shores and Peloponnesus, lays as the most basal one."

Sex estimation based on measurements of unidentified skeletal remains recovered in crime and death scenes can be accomplished with accuracy. In mass disasters, however, the remains are often fleshed, burned, and/or commingled. As a result, osteometric methods are difficult to apply. In such cases, radiography can be of great use during the examination process. A total of 101 (53 males and 48 females) adult humeri were radiographed using digital equipment (Technix TCA 4R PLUS). Specific measurements were taken on the radiographs and then analyzed. Multivariate discriminant function analysis was applied, and the results showed up to 89.1% classification accuracy. Single variables performed equally well for both epiphyses reaching 86.1% correct group membership. The method proposed here is successful, offering an alternative sex estimation technique applicable to the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are semi-fleshed, burned, mutilated, or otherwise unrecognizable. Specifically, this method is extremely useful when maceration of the remains is not an option.

"Treatment delay during myocardial infarction may be due to a number of factors, such as age, sex, socioeconomic status and interpretation of symptoms. However, whether residence plays a role has not been fully investigated and, if known, could provide information that will help target specific populations. This study investigated whether urban and rural residents in Greece differ in the time required to seek and receive medical assistance during acute myocardial infarction, according to their characteristics and the determinants of their delay. This was an observational study (with a structured interview) conducted in one academic and one regional hospital on the island of Crete, Greece, consisting of 348 patients with confirmed myocardial infarction. Patients from rural and urban areas did not differ in the decision time before seeking medical assistance (180 min vs 240 min, p=0.058). Those living in rural areas experienced a longer delay in reaching hospital once they sought assistance (50 min vs 20 min, p&lt;0.0001). The total median delay time (4.25 hours for rural and 4.75 hours for urban patients, p=0.9) was positively affected by female sex and negatively affected by a patient's belief that symptoms were serious, and that they were heart-related. Strategies should be developed to reduce the treatment delay during myocardial infarction for residents of both urban and rural areas, especially for women. Patients interpreting symptoms as being serious and originating from the heart are important for a shorter delay. A better health system is needed in rural Greece in order to deal more effectively with medical emergencies such as myocardial infarction."

"Fosfomycin is an antimicrobial commonly used in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The microbiological effectiveness of fosfomycin against nonurinary Gram-negative isolates has not been widely investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of fosfomycin against Gram-negative nonurinary isolates in a region of Greece where considerable antimicrobial resistance has been detected. Data were retrieved from the microbiological library of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete. We retrospectively examined the susceptibility of all Gram-negative nonurinary isolates to fosfomycin, collected over 1 year (January-December 2008). A total of 594 nonurinary Gram-negative isolates were examined. Susceptibility testing was performed for 270 (45.4%) Enterobacteriaceae, 209 (35.2%) Gram-negative nonfermentative bacilli and 115 (19.4%) other Gram-negative bacteria. In total, 385 (64.8%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. Specifically, all Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella species isolates were susceptible. Additionally, 73 out of 94 (77.7%) Klebsiella pneumoniae (including carbapenem-resistant strains), 22 out of 32 (68.8%) Enterobacter species and 51 out of 79 (64.5%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. Susceptibility was highest amongst isolates (45 of 61; 73.8%) taken from outpatients and lowest for intensive care unit isolates (78 of 161; 48.4%). Isolates originating from the pediatric wards exhibited higher susceptibility (45 of 63; 71.4%) than isolates originating from other departments (340 of 531; 64%). In a region with relatively high levels of antimicrobial resistance, fosfomycin seems to exhibit good levels of in vitro activity against Gram-negative nonurinary isolates. These data justify further evaluation of its potential clinical effectiveness."

"This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity and investigate associated factors in a representative sample of Cretan school children. As part of a cross-sectional study in children aged 10-12 years (n = 481, 48% boys) in 27 (urban and rural) schools in Crete, Greece, the rates of overweight and obesity were estimated and multiple logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between several factors and body mass index (BMI). It was shown that 28% and 13% of children were overweight and obese, respectively. Factors affecting children's BMI classification included: gender (95% CI: 0.21 to 0.56); birth weight (95% CI: 1.33 to 3.46); parental overweight or obesity (95% CI: 1.11 to 6.5 and 95% CI: 4.37 to 30.7 for one and both overweight or obese parents, respectively), paternal educational level (95% CI: 0.89 to 3.48 and 95% CI: 1.49 to 6.13 for low and high educational level, respectively); and cardiovascular fitness levels (95% CI: 0.87 to 0.92). The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity was alarmingly high in the current population (41%); several physiological, behavioural and social factors were shown to affect children's BMI status. These findings highlight the extent of the child obesity problem in Crete and support the need for actions to be taken at a national level to tackle the obesity epidemic."

"Farmers from Crete as first studied within the framework of the Seven Countries Study, were historically known for holding the title of the 'gold standard' of health status globally and had a very low prevalence of both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. Taking the above into account we evaluated the changes in CVD risk factors among farmers in Crete, Greece and compared our findings with data from the 1960s. Cross-sectional. Five hundred and two farmers (18-79 years old) from the Valley of Messara in Crete were randomly selected and examined in 2005. Complete clinical, biochemical, dietetic, anthropometrical and lifestyle CVD risk factors were assessed, matched and compared with published data from the 1960s. In comparison with 45 years ago, present day male farmers from Crete were found to have a 30% higher BMI (29.8 vs. 22.9 kg/m, P&lt;0.001) and a 16% higher total cholesterol level (239.6 vs. 206.9 mg/dl, P&lt;0.001) and also a not so favourable daily dietary intake (increase in meat and saturated fat and decrease in fruit, P&lt;0.001, respectively), while a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure and energy intake was noticed. In regards to changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue fatty acid composition, a decrease in monounsaturated (P&lt;0.001) and an increase in saturated fatty acids (P&lt;0.001) was also found elucidating the temporal change in dietary habits. The population's lack of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, have led to the fact that currently farmers from Crete are likely to be at a higher risk for developing CVD in comparison with earlier generations."

"The standardized cardiovascular disease death rate for the Greek population in Crete has increased since the 1960s, unlike the all-cause and cardiovascular disease death rate for Australia's Greek migrant population, which has remained paradoxically low. A small window of opportunity remains in which the vascular profile of this interesting atypical migrant population can be characterized. This study assessed whether ethnicity modulates the risk of diabetic retinopathy in Greek-born migrants to Australia. The study design was a community-based cross-sectional study of diabetic retinopathy in 107 Greek-born and Australian-born men with Type 2 diabetes, aged 44-83 years. Diabetic retinopathy was assessed by mydriatic three-field retinal photography. Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was lower in Greek-born than in Australian-born participants (22 and 37%, respectively). Despite having a higher mean systolic blood pressure level (148 vs. 137 mmHg), Greek-born men had a significantly lower risk of diabetic retinopathy than Australian-born men, after adjusting for age, duration of diabetes, glycated haemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, albumin to creatinine ratio, and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels [odds ratio 0.32 (0.10-0.99); r(2) = 0.41, P = 0.047]. Greek ethnicity may confer some protection against diabetic retinopathy to Australia's Greek-born migrants, an effect not explained by established risk factors for diabetic retinopathy. A small window of opportunity remains in which to elucidate the ethnicity-related exposures that modulate vascular risk in this older migrant population."

"To assess the long-term effectiveness of a school-based health education intervention program 10 years after its initiation. In 1992 the total population of first grade students from three counties of Crete participated in the study. Over 1000 students were randomly selected for initial and periodic evaluation. Biochemical and behavioural parameters (anthropometric, lipoproteins, blood pressure, physical activity, dietary record and health habits) were measured. Re-evaluation of the program was performed at 3, 6 and 10 years after its initiation. Ten years after the initiation of the program, the results showed that BMI had increased significantly less (p&lt;0.001) and performance in the shuttle run test was significantly better (p&lt;0.001) in the intervention group as compared to the control group. The reduction in total cholesterol noted in both groups was significantly greater in the intervention group than in the control group (p&lt;0.001). The incidence of smoking was also significantly lower in the intervention group (intervention group 7%, control group 13%, p&lt;0.005). This program appears to improve children's health and decrease risk factors for chronic diseases. If these positive effects are maintained in the forthcoming decades, the risk of chronic diseases may well be reduced."

Large amounts of solid waste are disposed in landfills and the potential of particulate matter (PM) emissions into the atmosphere is significant. Particulate matter emissions in landfills are the result of resuspension from the disposed waste and other activities such as mechanical recycling and composting, waste unloading and sorting, the process of coating residues and waste transport by trucks. Measurements of ambient levels of inhalable particulate matter (PM(10)) were performed in a landfill site located at Chania (Crete, Greece). Elevated PM(10) concentrations were measured in the landfill site during several landfill operations. It was observed that the meteorological conditions (mainly wind velocity and temperature) influence considerably the PM(10) concentrations. Comparison between the PM(10) concentrations at the landfill and at a PM(10) background site indicates the influence of the landfill activities on local concentrations at the landfill. No correlation was observed between the measurements at the landfill and the background sites. Finally, specific preventing measures are proposed to control the PM concentrations in landfills.

Leukoencephalopathies in dogs encompass presumably inherited conditions such as leukodystrophies, hypomyelination or spongiform degeneration, but other causes, such as virus infections and toxic or nutritional factors, might also play a contributory role. In this report, we provide evidence of parvovirus infection and replication in the brains of five 6-week-old Cretan hound puppies suffering from a puppy shaker syndrome and leukoencephalopathy. Although these puppies belonged to two different litters, they were closely related, tracing back two generations to the same sire. Histologically, a mild to moderate lymphohistiocytic meningitis, with focal lymphohistiocytic leukoencephalitis in two animals, and a mild to moderate vacuolation with myelin loss, mainly in the white matter of the cerebellum was detected. Vacuolation was also found in the corpus callosum, fimbria hippocampi, mesencephalon, capsula interna, basal ganglia, and hypothalamus. By immunohistology and in situ hybridization, either parvoviral antigen, DNA, mRNA, or replicative intermediate DNA were detected in the cerebellum, hippocampus, periventricular areas, corpus callosum, cerebral cortex, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. Parvovirus antigen, DNA, and mRNA were present in cells of the outer granular layer of the cerebellum and in periventricular cells, most likely representing spongioblasts, glial cells, neurons, endothelial cells, occasional macrophages, and ependymal cells. Sequencing revealed canine parvovirus type 2 stretches. Thus, an association of parvovirus infection with the leukoencephalopathy seems likely, possibly facilitated by a genetic predisposition due to the mode of inbreeding in this particular dog breed.
PMID:20595348	Falara V, Pichersky E, Kanellis AK	Plant Physiol. 154(1):301-10	2010	A copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase from the angiosperm Cistus creticus subsp. creticus is a putative key enzyme for the formation of pharmacologically active, oxygen-containing labdane-type diterpenes.	The resin of Cistus creticus subsp. creticus, a plant native to Crete, is rich in labdane-type diterpenes with significant antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The full-length cDNA of a putative diterpene synthase was isolated from a C. creticus trichome cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein is highly similar (59%-70% identical) to type B diterpene synthases from other angiosperm species that catalyze a protonation-initiated cyclization. The affinity-purified recombinant Escherichia coli-expressed protein used geranylgeranyl diphosphate as substrate and catalyzed the formation of copal-8-ol diphosphate. This diterpene synthase, therefore, was named CcCLS (for C. creticus copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase). Copal-8-ol diphosphate is likely to be an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the oxygen-containing labdane-type diterpenes that are abundant in the resin of this plant. RNA gel-blot analysis revealed that CcCLS is preferentially expressed in the trichomes, with higher transcript levels found in glands on young leaves than on fully expanded leaves, while CcCLS transcript levels increased after mechanical wounding. Chemical analyses revealed that labdane-type diterpene production followed a similar pattern, with higher concentrations in trichomes of young leaves and increased accumulation upon wounding.

"Pregnant women are exposed to tobacco smoke through active smoking and contact with secondhand smoke (SHS), and these exposures have a significant impact on public health. We investigated the factors that mediate active smoking, successful quitting, and SHS exposure among pregnant women in Crete, Greece. Using a cotinine-validated questionnaire, data were collected on active smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke from 1291 women who had successfully completed the first contact questionnaire of the prospective mother-child cohort (Rhea) in Crete during the 12th week of pregnancy. Active smoking at some time during pregnancy was reported by 36% of respondents, and 17% were current smokers at week 12 of gestation. Those less likely to quit smoking during pregnancy were those married to a smoker (OR, 1.76; P = 0.008), those who were multiparous (1.72; P = 0.011), and those with young husbands. Of the 832 (64%) nonsmokers, almost all (94%, n = 780) were exposed to SHS, with the majority exposed at home (72%) or in a public place (64%). Less educated women and younger women were exposed more often than their better educated and older peers (P &lt; 0.001). Adjusting for potential confounders, parental level of education, age, and ethnicity were the main mediators of exposure to SHS during pregnancy. Active smoking and exposure to SHS are very prevalent among pregnant women in Greece. The above findings indicate the need for support of population-based educational interventions aimed at smoking cessation in both parents, as well as of the importance of establishing smoke-free environments in both private and public places."

"A survey of the Phlebotomus populations of the city of Athens and its suburbs, of the islands of the Saronikos gulf, of the island of Euboea, of southern Peloponnesus, and of Crete was carried out in the summer of 1957. Sandflies were found to have become practically extinct in all areas where systematic spraying with residual insecticides had been performed since the vector control programme was started in 1946. On the other hand, they were still plentiful in villages which had not been included in the programme, and fairly plentiful in unsprayed towns and cities. P. papatasii was the only species encountered in Athens, and by far the predominating species in most other places. Susceptibility tests on P. papatasii showed an LC(50) for DDT of 0.28% at Athens and 0.75% at Chania in crete; the LC(50) for dieldrin was approximately 0.2%."

All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from paediatric clinical samples at Heraklion University General Hospital in the 10-year period 2000-2009 were tested for serotype and susceptibility to antimicrobials. Among a total of 258 strains, 159 were isolated in the 5-year period 2000-2004, before the introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), and 99 in the post-PCV7 5-year period 2005-2009. The prevalence of PCV7-included serotypes decreased in the post-PCV7 period (p = 0.0002), but an increase was observed for serotypes 7F (p = 0.002) and 19A (p = 0.004). Pan-susceptibility rates and susceptibility to cotrimoxazole increased in the post-PCV7 period (p = 0.01 and p = 0.008, respectively), but serotype 19A emerged as a contributor to multi-resistance (p = 0.007). PCV7 was followed by decreased S. pneumoniae resistance and prevalence of vaccine-related serotypes but increased prevalence of serotypes 7F and 19A. Continuing surveillance is required after the recent introduction of PCV10 and PCV13.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are considered underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed chronic diseases. In The Netherlands, a COPD-asthma telemedicine service has been developed to increase GPs' ability to diagnose and manage COPD and asthma. A telemedicine COPD-asthma service may benefit Greece as it is a country, partly due to its geography, that does not have easy access to pulmonologists. Therefore, a pilot feasibility study has been designed in Greece in order to establish this telemedicine service. Ten rural practices, in the island of Crete, with an average population of 2000 patients per practice will pilot the project supported by three pulmonologists. This paper presents the translated interfaces, the flowcharts and the steps that are considered as necessary for this feasibility study in Crete, Greece.

Origanum dictamnus (Lamiaceae family), an endemic plant of the Greek island of Crete, is widely used as a traditional medicine since antiquity, all over Europe. The aim of the present review is to present comprehensive information of the plant's botanical taxonomy and morphology, as well as of the chemical constituents, biological and pharmacological research on O. dictamnus, which will be presented and critically evaluated. The paper also highlights particularly interesting aspects and common medicinal uses not previously described in the specific ethnobotanical literature. An increasing number of chemical and pharmacological studies have been reported recently, some of which strongly support its traditional medicinal uses against various illnesses such as sore throat, cough and gastric ulcer. A variety of compounds, including flavonoids, lipids and terpenoids (mainly carvacrol and thymol) have been identified from the plant. Current studies have showed that the extracts, the essential oil, as well as their active principles possess several pharmacological properties, like antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-ulcer ones. The recent scientific data and the rich historical evidence of its medicinal uses could support further research as well as its use as a safe herbal medicinal product.

"Several factors place victims with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at increased risk for infection. The purpose of this study was to delineate the frequency, types and risk factors for infection in patients with TBI who undergo neurosurgery. Retrospective surveillance of infections in patients with TBI, aged  ≥18 years who underwent neurosurgery in University of Crete between 1999 and 2005. Two hundred fifty-eight patients (76.7% men) who underwent 342 procedures were included. One hundred forty-two infections occurred, mainly lower respiratory tract infections (44.4% of the number of infections) and surgical site infections (SSIs) (25.4%). In multivariate analysis, SSIs were independently associated with the length of stay (p &lt; 0.001), history of malignancy (p = 0.008), CSF leak (p = 0.012), any concomitant infection (p = 0.010), particularly urinary tract infections (p = 0.001) and the use of lumbar and/or ventricular drains (p = 0.005). Meningitis was independently associated with the total length of stay (p &lt; 0.001), the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation beyond surgery (p = 0.028) and the presence of a lumbar and/or ventricular drain (p &lt; 0.001). Respiratory tract infections were common in patients with TBI who underwent surgery with Acinetobacter spp. being the emerging offending pathogens. Device-related postoperative communication of the CSF and the environment was a significant risk factor for SSI development and meningitis in particular. Malignancy was an independent risk factor for SSIs. The prevalence of the offending pathogens must be determined institution by institution for the establishment of proper antibiotic treatment on suspicion."

In a recent study of pelvic dimorphism, Steyn and Patriquin demonstrated that sex classification accuracies for a combined sample of South African blacks, South African whites, and Greeks living on Crete, differed very little from those obtained separately for the three groups. These results suggest that population-specific formulae may be unnecessary when using pelvic dimensions to discriminate sex, and according to the authors, the formulae derived in their study from a large and ethnically diverse sample should provide reliable standards for determining sex in a variety of populations. The purpose of the present study was to assess the accuracy of the discriminant function equation for acetabular diameter published by the aforementioned authors on a documented skeletal sample from France. The overall allocation accuracy obtained utilizing the pooled-group equation (84.1%) did not differ appreciably from that achieved using a sample-specific formula developed from the French dataset employed in this study (85.4%). This result is of practical importance to forensic anthropologists working in France, and elsewhere, particularly in situations where there is some question as to the population affinity of the skeletal remains. Future studies should continue to combine pelvic and non-pelvic data from disparate populations, to develop additional osteometric standards for discriminating sex with high accuracy across human groups.

Results from a randomized cross-over study.	"To investigate the impact of a diet modeled on the traditional Cretan Mediterranean diet on metabolic control and vascular risk in type 2 diabetes. Twenty-seven subjects (47-77 yrs) with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to consume either the intervention diet ad libitum or their usual diet for 12 weeks and then cross over to the alternate diet. Most of the meals and staple foods for the intervention diet were provided. Lipids, glycemic variables, blood pressure, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, plasma carotenoids and body composition (anthropometry and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) were assessed at baseline, and at the end of both diet periods. Dietary adherence was monitored using plasma carotenoid and fatty acid (FA) analysis, complemented by diet diaries. Compared with usual diet, on the ad libitum Mediterranean intervention diet glycosylated haemoglobin fell from 7.1% (95% CI: 6.5-7.7) to 6.8% (95% CI: 6.3-7.3) (p=0.012) and diet quality improved significantly [plant:animal (g/day) food ratio increased from 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1-1.5) to 5.4 (95% CI: 4.3-6.6) (p&lt;0.001)], plasma lycopene and lutein/zeaxanthin increased (36% and 25%, respectively), plasma saturated and trans FAs decreased, and monounsaturated FAs increased.

PMID:20697424	Spence JD	Nat Rev Neurol. 6(9):477-86	2010	Secondary stroke prevention. 	Secondary stroke prevention can reduce the risk of recurrent stroke by approximately 90%. To achieve such a reduction, early implementation of preventative measures and administration of therapy appropriate to the underlying cause of the presenting transient ischemic attack or stroke are crucial. Smoking cessation and a Cretan Mediterranean diet are each more effective than any single medication in reducing the risk of recurrent stroke. Control of resistant hypertension can markedly reduce the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and lacunar infarction but might require therapy that is specific to the underlying cause. New antiplatelet agents have been developed or are in development that might avoid the issues of resistance and drug interactions that prevail with established agents of this type. Furthermore, new anticoagulants in development offer promise of replacing warfarin, and devices to occlude the atrial appendage are on the horizon for patients with atrial fibrillation. Carotid endarterectomy is appropriate for severe symptomatic carotid stenosis, while stenting might be appropriate for symptomatic stenosis where the surgical risk is high. Most patients with asymptomatic stenosis, however, should be treated with medical therapy, unless indicators of high stroke risk are present. In this narrative Review, I discuss recent advances in secondary stroke prevention.

Isolates with intermediate and high-level resistance to penicillin increased from 17 and 12.4% over the period 2001-2004 to 31.1 and 16.7% over the years 2005-2008, respectively (p = 0.03). Macrolide resistance increased from 27.6 to 38.9%, but this was not significant (p = 0.13), while resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not change over time, with approximately one fourth of the isolates being resistant. Only one isolate was resistant to fluoroquinolones. Multi-resistance was observed among 42 (58.1%) penicillin non-susceptible strains. The isolates tested belonged to 20 different serotypes. Serotypes 19F and 19A were the most common among penicillin-resistant isolates. The currently licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine covered 98.4% of all 186 typeable S. pneumoniae strains. Our study emphasizes the importance of continued serotyping and surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of all S. pneumoniae clinical isolates, especially invasive ones, in order to guide the clinician in the choice of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for serious pneumococcal infections.

Previous studies have examined factors affecting the position of the eyeball to the orbit. This study examined the role of effective orbital volume (EOV), defined as the difference between orbital and eyeball volume, as a determinant of eyeball position, using MRI scans. Forty-six patients were recruited from the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete Greece. Patients with a history of orbital disease were excluded. Distances between eyeball poles and orbital landmarks were measured in T1 weighted transverse, sagittal and coronal orbital images. The protrusion of the eyeball in the sagittal and transverse planes was recorded. The volume of the eyeball and bony orbit, the EOV, the volume of the extraocular muscles as well as clinical information (age, gender, Hertel exophthalmometry) were also recorded. EOV was significantly associated with orbital volume but not with eyeball volume. EOV was also significantly associated with transverse and sagittal globe protrusions. Females displayed significantly lower orbital and eyeball volumes as well as EOV than males but higher transverse globe protrusion than males. Variations in EOV are associated with orbital volume rather than with eyeball volume. EOV is associated with globe protrusion and may be taken into account in the planning of various procedures, including orbital decompression, treatment of enophthalmos or the size of orbital implants following enucleation.

"A case-control and a case-crossover study were performed to investigate a Campylobacter jejuni outbreak in Crete in 2009. Most cases originated from rural areas, served by a different water-supply system from that of the adjacent town. Thirty-seven cases and 79 controls were interviewed; cases were interviewed for two different time periods for the case-crossover study. Stool cultures, PFGE and MLST subtyping were run in human samples. Univariately, consumption of tap water was associated with C. jejuni infection. Stratified analysis revealed that water-supply system was an effect modifier of this association. In the multivariable analysis, the rural areas' water supplier and drinking tap water were risk factors. No risk factors were revealed in the case-crossover study. No Campylobacter were isolated in the tested water samples. There is strong epidemiological evidence that tap water was the vehicle of the outbreak."

"The general decline in traffic accidents throughout Europe is not the case for Crete, a favorite holiday destination. The extent of problem and reflections on the significant impact of the interplay of organizational, educational, &amp; technological interventions by the Emergency Coordination Center of Crete (ECC-Crete) are presented. 10-year data from 1996-2006 have been analyzed revealing demographic, topological, and qualitative issues of traffic accidents in Grete. Primary source of data is 315000 emergency calls answered by ECC-Crete. Over this 10 year period, ECC-Crete gradually employed advanced medical technologies and electronic protocol-based handling in all phases of an emergency episode contributing to its timely and effective management. GIS/GPS technology and telemetry for biosignals in ambulances, up-to-date triage protocols combined with incidence analysis provide vital information for continuous process improvement. In 2000-2006, process improvement due to technological and organizational changes has led to increased efficiency. The mean reduction was ~75% in dispatch time, ~50% in the time at accident scene for metropolitan areas, and ~75% in time at the emergency ward, mainly due to medical interventions on site."

Institute of Vision and Optics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Prospective case series. This noncomparative study measured IOP by GAT before CXL and 6 months and 12 months after CXL. The study evaluated 55 eyes (55 patients). There was a statistically significant increase in the measured IOP 6 months and 12 months after CXL (both P&lt;.001). The mean measured IOP was 9.95 mm Hg ± 3.01 (SD) before CXL, 11.40 ± 2.89 mm Hg at 6 months, and 11.35 ± 3.38 mm Hg at 12 months. The change in IOP measurements at both postoperative examinations was not correlated with patient age, preoperative pachymetry, or preoperative keratometry readings. After riboflavin-UVA CXL in eyes with keratoconus, there was a significant increase in IOP measured by GAT that was probably caused by an increase in corneal rigidity."

The role of animal-protein consumption on the prevalence of diabetes is not yet fully understood. For this reason, this study investigated the relationship between long-term animal-protein intake and diabetes in elderly individuals with no known cardiovascular disease. During 2005-2007, 1190 men and women, aged 65-100 years, from Cyprus, Mitilini, Samothraki, Cephalonia, Crete, Lemnos, Corfu and Zakynthos were enrolled into the study. Diabetes was defined as fasting blood glucose ≥ 125 mg/dL or the use of antidiabetic medication. All participants were asked about their dietary habits through a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Assessment of protein and energy intakes was performed using food-composition tables. After adjusting for age, gender, obesity, history of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and dietary habits, a 5% increase in protein intake from meat and meat products was associated with a 34% (OR=1.338, 95% CI: 1.02-1.76) greater likelihood of diabetes, while a 5% increase in total protein intake was associated with a 29% (OR=1.288, 95% CI: 1.00-1.69) greater likelihood of diabetes. No significant associations between diabetes and protein intakes from vegetables and cereals were observed. Animal-protein consumption was associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes among the elderly, whereas protein intakes, especially from plant sources, within the recommended range appear to confer considerable protection. This suggests that reducing or controlling the burden of diabetes through dietary means in the elderly should include monitoring their daily protein intake.
PMID:20920353	Sauer J, Hausdorf B	BMC Evol Biol. 10:299	2010	Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the radiation of the land snail genus Xerocrassa on Crete based on mitochondrial sequences and AFLP markers. 	A non-adaptive radiation triggered by sexual selection resulted in ten endemic land snail species of the genus Xerocrassa on Crete. Only five of these species and a more widespread species are monophyletic in a mitochondrial gene tree. The reconstruction of the evolutionary history of such closely related species can be complicated by incomplete lineage sorting, introgression or inadequate taxonomy. To distinguish between the reasons for the nonmonophyly of several species in the mitochondrial gene tree we analysed nuclear AFLP markers. Whereas six of the eleven morphologically delimited Xerocrassa species from Crete are monophyletic in the mitochondrial gene tree, nine of these species are monophyletic in the tree based on AFLP markers. Only two morphologically delimited species could not be distinguished with the multilocus data and might have diverged very recently or might represent extreme forms of a single species. The nonmonophyly of X. rhithymna with respect to X. kydonia is probably the result of incomplete lineage sorting, because there is no evidence for admixture in the AFLP data and the mitochondrial haplotype groups of these species coalesce deeply. The same is true for the main haplotype groups of X. mesostena. The nonmonophyly of X. franciscoi might be the result of mitochondrial introgression, because the coalescences of the haplotypes of this species with some X. mesostena haplotypes are shallow and there is admixture with neighbouring X. mesostena. The most likely causes for the nonmonophyly of species in the mitochondrial gene tree of the Xerocrassa radiation on Crete could be inferred using AFLP data by a combination of several criteria, namely the depth of the coalescences in the gene tree, the geographical distribution of shared genetic markers, and concordance with results of admixture analyses of nuclear multilocus markers. The strongly subdivided population structure increases the effective population size of land snail species and, thus, the likelihood of a long persistence of ancestral polymorphisms. Our study suggests that ancestral polymorphisms are a frequent cause for nonmonophyly of species with a strongly subdivided population structure in gene trees.

"Erysipelas is a superficial form of cellulitis affecting the upper dermis and superficial lymphatics. The widespread use of antibiotics may affect clinical findings and response to therapy of infectious disorders. The purpose of the study was to investigate the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory features of erysipelas and to compare the results of treatment with penicillin vs. other antibiotic regimens. All charts of erysipelas patients treated at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece from 1994 to 2002 were retrospectively studied. Median age of the 99 patients was 54.5 years; 59% were females. The most frequent site involved was the lower extremity (76%), followed by the face (17%) and upper extremity (6%). In 61 patients (62%), a possible entry portal was identified. The most common manifestation of erysipelas was local symptoms and signs (pain, erythema, and swelling) in all patients, together with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (60%). Fever was present in 25% of patients. The most commonly used antibiotic was intravenous penicillin G (64%). In the penicillin group, mean duration of fever after treatment initiation was shorter than in the nonpenicillin group (1.7 vs. 4.5 days, P = 0.002). Both treatment failures and recurrences were the same between the two groups. The diagnosis of erysipelas can be based on careful examination for local signs and symptoms. The role of ESR in primary diagnosis needs further investigation. Penicillin seems to preserve its fundamental role in the treatment of disease."

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) comprise a powerful tool to approximate the complicated behavior and response of physical systems allowing considerable reduction in computation time during time-consuming optimization runs. In this work, a Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Network (RBFN) is combined with a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to solve a water resources management problem, using an optimization procedure. The objective of the optimization scheme is to cover the daily water demand on the coastal aquifer east of the city of Heraklion, Crete, without reducing the subsurface water quality due to seawater intrusion. The RBFN is utilized as an on-line surrogate model to approximate the behavior of the aquifer and to replace some of the costly evaluations of an accurate numerical simulation model which solves the subsurface water flow differential equations. The RBFN is used as a local approximation model in such a way as to maintain the robustness of the DE algorithm. The results of this procedure are compared to the corresponding results obtained by using the Simplex method and by using the DE procedure without the surrogate model. As it is demonstrated, the use of the surrogate model accelerates the convergence of the DE optimization procedure and additionally provides a better solution at the same number of exact evaluations, compared to the original DE algorithm.

"In 1988, the SPILI project was established in order to evaluate the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile of the inhabitants of Spili, in rural Crete, Greece. The first reports from this project revealed that against the unfavourable risk factors' profile observed, only a few men with a previous myocardial infarction were encountered. A follow-up study (SPILI II) was performed twelve years after the initial examination, and the unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile was re-confirmed. This paper presents a hypothesis formulated on the basis of previous research to investigate if dynamic psycho-social determinants, including social coherence of the local community, religiosity and spirituality, are protective against the development of coronary heart disease in a well-defined population. A follow-up examination of this Cretan cohort is currently being performed to assess the link between psychosocial factors and CVD. Psychosocial factors including sense of control, religiosity and spirituality are assessed in together with conventional CVD risk factors. Smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as dietary habits and activity levels are recorded. Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, as well as ultrasound measurement of carotid intima media thickness, a preclinical marker of atherosclerosis, will also be measured. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS TESTED: The issue of the cardio-protective effect of psycho-social factors would be revisited based on the results of this Cretan cohort; nevertheless, further research is needed across different sub-populations in order to establish a definite relationship. A comprehensive approach based on the aspects of bio-social life may result in more accurate CVD risk management."

"Exposure to disinfection by-products (DBPs) during pregnancy has been associated with adverse birth outcomes. We evaluated exposure to DBPs through ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption among pregnant women in Crete, in relation to birth weight and gestational age. The mother-child birth cohort in Crete ('Rhea' study) enrolled 1359 pregnant women at the third month of pregnancy (2007-2008), residents in the prefecture of Heraklion. Exposures were assessed through three questionnaires administered during pregnancy requesting extensive information on personal water-related habits. Tap water samples were collected in representative mother homes on the basis of detailed water distribution patterns, and were analysed for major DBPs including trihalomethanes (THMs). Logistic and linear regression models were applied. Pregnant women reported a high consumption of bottled water at home (76%) and work (96%). More than half the women (59%) washed dishes by hand, nearly all women (94%) took showers rather than baths (1%), and only 2% attended a swimming pool. THM levels were low (&lt;20 μg/l) with a high proportion of brominated compounds. When using quantitative estimates of residential exposure, we found no association with low birth weight (LBW, OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.4), small for gestational age for weight (SGAweight, OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.2) and preterm delivery (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.3). Similar results were observed when taking into account uptake of THMs through all exposure routes. We found no evidence for an increased risk of LBW, SGA and preterm delivery at the relatively low level exposure to THMs and particularly brominated THMs in Cretan drinking water."

Primary lymphedema is a rare, chronic and distressing condition with negative effects on physical, social and emotional level. The purpose of these reports was to present and discuss two different cases of primary lower limb lymphedema with a focus on its physical and mental impact and on some qualitative aspects of patients' self-reported experiences. The patients were recruited as they used occasional services within the University Hospital of Heraklion (Crete, Greece). The functional and mental impact of primary lymphedema was measured using the generic Medical Outcome Study short form-36 questionnaire and open-ended questions led to give more emphasis to patients' experiences. The analysis of short form-36 results in the first patient disclosed a significant functional impairment with a minor impact of the condition on emotional and social domains. For the second patient quality of life scores in the emotional and social domains were affected. Our findings support further the statement that physicians should pay full attention to appraise the patient's physical and emotional condition. General practitioners have the opportunity to monitor the long-term impact of chronic disorders. Posing simple open-ended questions and assessing the level of physical and mental deficits in terms of well-being through the use of specific metric tools can effectively follow-up rare conditions in the community.

Investigations of the presence of the precarcinogenic DNA adduct O⁶-methylguanine (O6-meG) in humans and its association with exposure or cancer risk have been hindered by the absence of analytic methods of adequate sensitivity and throughput. We report the development, validation, and application of an ELISA-type assay for O6-meG appropriate for large-scale population studies. In the new analytic method, restriction enzymes are used to digest DNA to fragments of size expected to contain no more than one O6-meG residue. Anti-adduct antisera are used to transfer O6-meG-containing fragments to a solid surface, where they are detected using anti-ssDNA antisera, the high ratio of normal nucleotides to adducts providing a strong signal enhancement. An assay with a limit of detection of 1.5 adducts/10⁹ nucleotides using 10 μg of DNA, a dynamic range of approximately two orders of magnitude and satisfactory precision and accuracy characteristics was established and validated. Analysis of samples from 120 subjects from the Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete led to the detection of O6-meG in 70% of maternal and 50% of cord blood buffy coat samples at mean levels of 0.65 and 0.38 adducts/10⁸ nucleotides, respectively. The frequent observation of O6-meG in human DNA is compatible with dietary compounds (e.g. N-nitroso compounds or their precursors), or endogenous processes being responsible for the formation of this adduct. The new assay opens the way for large-scale population studies of O6-meG as a biomarker of exposure or risk. The approach used in this assay can, in principle, be extended to any DNA adduct for which suitable antisera are available.

A retrospective study. 	The association between Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains controversial in medical bibliography. The main objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of PTC and HT coexistence in histopathologic material of thyroidectomized patients. In a retrospective study, the clinicohistopathologic data of 140 patients (19 males/121 females), who underwent a total or near total thyroidectomy for any thyroid pathology from January 2005 to December 2009 at the Naval Hospital of Crete, were analysed. The mean age of the patients was 52 years (range 16-74). HT was detected in 42 (30%) and PTC in 32 (22.9%) specimens. Coexistence of HT with PTC was present in 12 (8.6%) specimens. Among 32 specimens with PTC, the prevalence of HT was 37.5%. Among 42 specimens with HT, the prevalence of PTC was 28.6%. There was no statistically significant difference between the presence of PTC and HT in histopathologic material. The prevalence of PTC and HT coexistence in histopathologic material of 140 thyroidectomized patients was 8.6%, whereas the difference between PTC and HT was not statistically significant.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common form of malignancy in children. Recently, many studies have examined factors influencing both the susceptibility to ALL and the metabolism of widely used chemotherapeutic agents. These factors include, among others, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in various genes, such as the gene encoding for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), which has been proven polymorphic at the nucleotide positions 677 and 1298. Thirty-five children with ALL and 48 healthy adults of Cretan origin were genotyped for the presence of the MTHFR 677 and 1298 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The possible correlation of the polymorphisms with the risk for ALL and the presence of methotrexate-induced toxicities were examined. No significant association between the MTHFR genotypes and the susceptibility to ALL was observed. A borderline statistically significant relationship was detected after methotrexate administration, between the C677T genotype (polymorphisms) and leukopenia (p = 0.050) and between the A1298C polymorphism and normal aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase values (p = 0.065 and p = 0.053, respectively), which was strengthened for aspartate transaminase, after grouping the A1298A and A1298C genotypes together (p = 0.039). In our population the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms are related with hematologic toxicity and hepatotoxicity, respectively, and could be suggested as prognostic factors for these adverse events.

Fabulous architectonical constructions like great palaces, wonderful frescoes, and pottery as well as jewellery characterize this amazing civilization. According to all existing descriptions from ancient Greek historians and philosophers like Plato, Thucydides, Strabon but also from all the archaeological findings men and women lived freely and peacefully participating equal in all daily activities, sports, and games. The women were predominating. Minoan women enjoyed a higher social status than other women in later civilizations. Investigation of all the existing data concerning the Minoan culture. Archaeological databases, as well as data from the National University of Athens and other Greek historical institutions were collected and analyzed in order to present the Minoan culture. The Minoic civilization represents a paradigm of a well being society in which the woman played a dominant role. She was the 'mother' but also the 'active woman', who participated in all city activities. Four thousand years later a prototype of a society in which the role of the mother was recognized in an admirably way remains a magnificent paradigm.

The role of pesticides in suicidal acts has not yet received adequate attention in Greece despite an evident rise of 39% in pesticide use over the period 1990-1992 to 2002-2004. To investigate the epidemiology of pesticide suicide on the Greek island of Crete, a largely rural agricultural area, and by further exploring the victim profiles, as well as patterns and trends of pesticide ingestion, to suggest probable preventive measures. Self-poisoning suicides between 1999 and 2007 were reviewed and information gathered was entered into a computerized database. The overall incidence of intentional pesticide poisoning was 1.7 per 100,000, representing the second most frequently used suicide method after hanging. The victim profile was composed of the following features: middle aged male, rural habitant, who carried out a suicidal act by consuming primarily methomyl or paraquat (WHO toxicity class Ib and class II, respectively). As to the place of death, the vast majority was found dead in the place of intoxication. Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for a quarter of the suicides in Crete. More detailed research is required to identify aspects of these deaths amenable to prevention, but measures such as bans on the most toxic pesticides and changes in storage practice would appear to be sensible initial approaches.

"The aim of this study was to assess levels of knowledge regarding breast cancer screening among primary care physicians in rural areas of Crete. A cross-sectional survey of 106 general practitioners and internists and 83 trainee general practitioners (GPs) employed as of October 2004 and practicing at 14 primary health centers in Crete was performed. It was a self-administered survey with 27 items exploring knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors concerning delivery of general preventive and cancer screening services. The main outcome measures were responses to four items on approaches to breast cancer screening practices. Overall response rate was 55% (primary care physicians (PCPs) = 53%; trainee GPs = 60%). Respondents demonstrated a limited awareness of international recommendations for breast cancer screening and exhibited marked variation in their responses to survey items. Agreement with current international guidelines ranged from 31% to 58% for the individual survey items. This survey revealed limited knowledge among PCPs to well-publicized breast cancer screening guidelines and variations in approaches to breast cancer early detection."

"We aimed to present our experience regarding infections caused by Serratia spp. in a region with relatively high antimicrobial resistance rates. We retrospectively reviewed the databases of the microbiological laboratory of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete (2/2004-12/2009). A total of 77 patients [67.5% men, mean age ± standard deviation (SD) = 56.9 ± 24.5 years) were identified; 37.7% were outpatients. Sixty-five (84.4%) of the 77 included patients had a Serratia marcescens isolate; the remaining 12 patients had a non-marcescens Serratia spp. The most frequently observed infections were respiratory tract infection (32.5%) and keratitis/endophthalmitis (20.8%). Seventy-three (94.9%) patients were cured. Four deaths were observed; three of them were considered as attributed to the Serratia infection. No difference was found regarding the characteristics and outcomes between patients with Serratia marcescens and non-marcescens infections. In addition, antipseudomonal penicillins and their combinations with beta-lactamase inhibitors, as well as carbapenemes, and fluoroquinolones exhibited high antimicrobial activity against both the tested Serratia marcescens and non-marcescens isolates. Our study adds useful information regarding the characteristics and outcomes of patients with Serratia infection, as well as the susceptibilities of the respective Serratia marcescens and non-marcescens isolates, in a region with relatively high levels of antimicrobial resistance."

"We report N(2) fixation rates measured from two stations monitored monthly off the Mediterranean coast of Israel during 2006 and 2007, and along a transect from Israel to Crete in September 2008. Analyses of time-series data revealed expression of nifH genes from diazotrophs in nifH clusters I and II, including cyanobacterial bloom-formers Trichodesmium and diatom-Richelia intracellularis associations. However, nifH gene abundance and rates of N(2) fixation were very low in all size fractions measured (&gt; 0.7 µm). Volumetric (15) N uptake ranged from below detection (∼ 36% of &gt; 300 samples) to a high of 0.3 nmol N l(-1) d(-1) and did not vary distinctly with depth or season. Areal N(2) fixation averaged ∼ 1 to 4 µmol N m(-2) d(-1) and contributed only ∼ 1% and 2% of new production and ∼ 0.25% and 0.5% of primary production for the mixed (winter) and stratified (spring-fall) periods respectively. N(2) fixation rates along the 2008 east-west transect were also extremely low (0-0.04 nmol N l(-1) d(-1), integrated average 2.6 µmol N m(-2) d(-1) ) with 37% of samples below detection and no discernable difference between stations. We demonstrate that diazotrophy and N(2) fixation contribute only a minor amount of new N to the P impoverished eastern Mediterranean Sea."

"We report the first heterozygous case of Hb A(2)-NYU (HBD:c.39T&gt;A) in the Hellenic population. The proband, an adult female from the island of Crete, Greece, was identified during routine family screening. DEAE chromatography of the index case revealed a minor hemoglobin (Hb) fraction preceding the elution of the wild-type Hb A(2). DNA sequencing of the entire HBD gene coding regions indicated that the index case was heterozygous for the rare variant Hb A(2)-NYU. Family studies indicated that this Hb variant was inherited from the mother. This finding underlines the vast genetic heterogeneity of the HBD gene in the Hellenic population."

Acute urticaria (AU) is a common condition that often presents in childhood. Although there is a general perception of cyclic annual trends in AU, no one has tried to identify any seasonal variation on its prevalence and incidence, associate environmental influences and impute geographic, ethnic, or even genetic features that may contribute to its onset. We aimed to analyze the influence of climate and geographic parameters on annual fluctuation of AU cases referred to the Emergency Departments (EDs) of Norwich (UK) and Heraklion (Crete, Greece), compare all identifiable potential triggers and severity, and calculate the prevalence and incidence of AU. Record-based data of all children up to 14 yr of age referred to both EDs between June 2005 and May 2007 were examined retrospectively. Demographic characteristics and any potential identifiable triggers of AU were recorded and compared. Poisson's regression was utilized to examine any influence of meteorological parameters on AU incidence. Edwards' test for seasonality was applied to identify any significant seasonal trend of the AU incidence within each city. Seven hundred and twenty-nine AU cases were identified (324 in Norwich and 405 in Heraklion), among 56,624 total referrals (28,931 and 27,693 cases, respectively). Respiratory infections were found to be the most commonly associated potential triggers of AU and food allergens the least. AU cases and incidence rates in both cities were equally distributed during the study period. A non-significant seasonal trend in AU incidence (October, April-May) was observed in Norwich, in contrast to a significant seasonal pattern (December, February-May) of AU in Heraklion. Temperature was inversely associated with AU incidence, while the statistically significant effect of relative humidity varied. Acute childhood urticaria shows a similar epidemiological pattern in northern and southern Europe regardless of the expected differences in genetic, geographic, and environmental background. Temperature and humidity are correlated with AU incidence. Seasonality of several acute respiratory viral infections, the most prominent associated trigger of AU, coincides with the observed AU seasonality, suggesting a potential linkage. However, this needs to be elucidated from larger epidemiological studies.

"Research has suggested the abandonment of the traditional Mediterranean diet (MD) by youngsters for a more Westernized regime. The present study aimed (i) to delineate differences in the consumption of traditional Cretan dishes and key nutrients in the MD between two contiguous generations of women and (ii) define how these dietary changes contribute to the morbidity of the younger generation. Cross-sectional. The island of Crete, Greece. Eighty pairs of mothers and daughters, all living in their own households, were recruited from Crete. Information regarding the consumption of traditional Cretan dishes and two previous-day recalls were collected. The health status of the participants was also recorded. Simple correspondence analysis (SCA) was used to assess associations between differences in the food intake of daughters compared with their mothers and the prevalence of disease. The younger women showed increased intakes of rusks and meat dishes and decreased consumption of green vegetables, pulses and wine compared with their mothers. When nutrients were accounted for, only sugar consumption of the younger women surpassed the intake reported by their mothers. SCA associated hypercholesterolaemia in the daughters with increased cheese and meat intakes; allergies and respiratory problems were associated with lower cheese, fish and oil intakes; being overweight was associated with higher baked goods, oils, desserts, fish and alcohol intakes; and Fe-deficiency anaemia was associated with lower consumption of green vegetables. Results showed that, although a trend towards a more Westernized diet was noted in the younger women, the differences between the two generations appear to be small. Therefore, in Crete, the MD is still the primary diet regime. "

"Vitamin D deficiency is associated with osteomalacic myopathy, and muscle weakness related to vitamin D deficiency has been implicated as a possible risk factor for falls in the elderly. This study investigated the possible correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration and quadriceps muscle strength in ambulatory community dwelling Cretan men (n=13) and women (n=35) aged &gt; or = 65 years. Quadriceps muscle strength was measured isometrically using Cybex 6000 apparatus. The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly higher in men than in women (76.00 versus 49.11 nmol/l, respectively). Serum 25(OH)D values were &lt; 50 nmol/l in 15% of men and in 60% of women. Serum 25(OH)D concentration correlated positively with quadriceps muscle strength. In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency was common in the study participants despite the high levels of sunlight in Crete. Serum 25(OH)D levels were positively correlated with muscle strength."

Antibiotic over-prescribing has generally been considered to be common in Greece, however not much is known about current antibiotic use. The aim of this study was to investigate antibiotic prescribing in a well-defined rural population of 159 adults and 99 children over a 12-month period in Crete, Greece. The daily-defined doses (DDD) for 1000 people/day (DID) were 22.1 and 24.2 for children and adults respectively. The overall DID was 23.4, markedly lower than that previously reported for Greece. The use of penicillins was 49.5% of DDD in children and 31.7% in adults. Quinolones represented 2.2% of the total antibiotics (0% in children). Prescriptions of antibiotics were more common during the 3-month period from January to March for both children and adults. The findings of this study confirm the seasonal distribution of antibiotics used and the predominance of prescribing for respiratory tract infections. In the area of the study, antibiotic use seems to be lower than that previously reported for Greece, probably as a result of the recently established net of well-trained primary health physicians.

"To examine secular changes in anthropometric measurements and blood pressure (BP) in 1st-grade children in Crete, Greece, during 1992/93 and 2006/07. Children (aged 5.7-7.8 years) from two representative cross-sectional cohorts participated during 1992/93 (n=606) and 2006/07 (n=361). Body weight, body-mass-index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip (WHpR) and waist-to-height (WHtR) ratios, BP, 20 m-shuttle-run test (20 mSRT), and moderate-to-vigorous-physical-activity (MVPA) were assessed. There was a significant increase (P&lt;0.01) in body weight (+10.2% and +6.7%), BMI (+6.9% and +4.0%), WC (+5.6% and +5.1%), WHpR (+3.0% and +3.4%), and WHtR (+4.2% and +3.8%), for boys and girls, respectively, and in the proportion of overweight/obese boys (19.4% vs. 33.7%; P&lt;0.001) between 1992/93 and 2006/07. Both genders had decreased BP measurements in 2006/07 compared to 1992/93 (P&lt;0.001). In both periods, BP was higher in obese compared to overweight and normal children (P&lt;0.001), but there was no relationship between BP and physical activity (PA). A substantial decrease in BP was observed in Cretan children over a 15-year period, despite a concurrent increase in obesity and anthropometric indices. This may be attributed to lifestyle and dietary changes and does not support the hypothesis that the obesity epidemic in children has resulted in proportionate increases in BP levels."

Young people's alcohol and drug use increases during holidays. Despite strong associations between substance use and both violence and unintentional injury, little is known about this relationship in young people holidaying abroad. We examine how risks of violence and unintentional injury abroad relate to substance use and the effects of nationality and holiday destination on these relationships. A cross-sectional comparative survey of 6,502 British and German holidaymakers aged 16 to 35 years was undertaken in airports in Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Overall, 3.8% of participants reported having been in a physical fight (violence) on holiday and 5.9% reported unintentional injury. Two thirds reported having been drunk on holiday and over 10% using illicit drugs. Levels of drunkenness, drug use, violence, and unintentional injury all varied with nationality and holiday destination. Violence was independently associated with being male, choosing the destination for its nightlife, staying 8 to 14 days, smoking and using drugs on holiday, frequent drunkenness, and visiting Majorca (both nationalities) or Crete (British only). Predictors of unintentional injury were being male, younger, using drugs other than just cannabis on holiday, frequent drunkenness, and visiting Crete (both nationalities). Violence and unintentional injury are substantial risks for patrons of international resorts offering a hedonistic nightlife. Understanding those characteristics of resorts and their visitors most closely associated with such risks should help inform prevention initiatives that protect both the health of tourists and the economy of resorts marketed as safe and enjoyable places to visit.
PMID:21392307	Palombo MR	Integr Zool. 4(4):341-56	2009	"Body size structure of Pleistocene mammalian communities: what support is there for the ""island rule""? "	"Islands are often regarded by scientists as living laboratories of evolution and an optimal context for the study of forces influencing evolution and diversification. Two main issues have been attentively scrutinized and debated: the loss of biodiversity and the peculiar changes undergone by island settlers, primarily changes in size of endemic vertebrates. Over time, several hypotheses have been formulated to explain the causal mechanism of body size modification. Faunas of those islands where mainland taxa migrate more than once provide the most interesting data to answer the question of whether or not trends of insular taxa result from a predictable response to differences in competition and availability of niches between insular and mainland environments. To contribute to the debate, the body size structure of the Pleistocene mammalian faunas from two Mediterranean islands, Sicily and Crete, were analyzed and compared with the structure of coeval mainland faunas. The results obtained suggest that: (i) size of endemic species does not directly depend on the area of islands; (ii) evolution and size of endemic species seems somewhat affected by the degree of isolation (constraining colonization from mainland) and physiography (sometimes permitting adaptive radiation); (iii) in unbalanced insular communities, the shift in size of non-carnivorous species largely depends on the nature of competing species; and (iv) body size of carnivorous species mainly depends on the size of the most available prey. Consequently, it is rational to suppose that the body size of insular mammals mainly results from the peculiar biological dynamics that characterizes unbalanced insular communities. Ecological interaction, particularly the intraguild competition, is the major driver behind the evolution of insular communities, leading towards an optimization of energy balance through a change in body size of endemic settlers.

Sediment cores from the deep Balearic basin and the Cretan Sea provide evidence for the accumulation of Cd, Pd and Zn in the top few centimeters of the abyssal Mediterranean sea-bottom. In both cores, 206Pb/207Pb profiles confirm this anthropogenic impact with less radiogenic imprints toward surface sediments. The similarity between excess 210Pb accumulated in the top core and the 210Pb flux suggests that top core metal inventories reasonably reflect long-term atmospheric deposition to the open Mediterranean. Pb inventory in the western core for the past 100 years represents 20-30% of sediment coastal inventories, suggesting that long-term atmospheric deposition determined from coastal areas has to be used cautiously for mass balance calculations in the open Mediterranean. In the deeper section of both cores, Al normalized trace metal profiles suggest diagenetic remobilization of Fe, Mn, Cu and, to a lesser extent, Pb that likely corresponds to sapropel event S1.

"To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Geno Type® MTBDRplus compared with conventional proportional method (PM) drug susceptibility testing (DST) for detecting drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) clinical isolates derived from the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. All MTB clinical isolates obtained between January 2000 and May 2009 were tested prospectively using the PM DST. All isolates were also tested either prospectively (strains isolated after January 2006; n = 140) or retrospectively (January 2000-December 2005; n = 81) using MTBDRplus. Among the 221 MTB isolates tested, 19 were resistant to isoniazid based on PM DST. The MTBDRplus assay identified 18 INH-resistant strains. Of these, 12 strains gave positive hybridization results with the mutation-specific probe katG Ser315Thr. The other six INH-resistant strains carried the mutation 15C→T in the inhA promoter region. One INH-sensitive strain, as determined by PM DST, had a katG gene mutation. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of MTBDRplus for INH were 89.5, 99.5, 94.7 and 99%, respectively. The single rifampicin-resistant strain that was also the only multidrug resistance isolate gave a positive hybridization result with the mutation-specific probe MUT1: D516V, which confers resistance to rifampicin. Despite the advantages of MTBDRplus (turn-around time of only 1 working day) compared with PM DST, the latter is still required in every case of a MTB clinical isolate, as the molecular assay does not detect 100% of drug resistance, especially INH resistance."

To identify and describe dietary patterns in a cohort of pregnant women, and investigate whether dietary patterns during pregnancy are related to postpartum depression (PPD). The study uses data from the prospective mother-child cohort 'Rhea' study. Pregnant women completed an FFQ in mid-pregnancy and the Edinburg Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) at 8-10 weeks postpartum. Dietary patterns during pregnancy ('health conscious', 'Western') were identified using principal component analysis. Associations between dietary patterns categorized in tertiles and PPD symptoms were investigated by multivariable regression models after adjusting for confounders. Heraklion, Crete, Greece, 2007-2010. A total of 529 women, participating in the 'Rhea' cohort. High adherence to a 'health conscious' diet, characterized by vegetables, fruit, pulses, nuts, dairy products, fish and olive oil, was associated with lower EPDS scores (highest v. lowest tertile: β-coefficient = -1·75, P = 0·02). Women in the second (relative risk (RR) = 0·52, 95 % CI 0·30, 0·92) or third tertile (RR = 0·51, 95 % CI 0·25, 1·05) of the 'health conscious' dietary pattern were about 50 % less likely to have high levels of PPD symptoms (EPDS ≥ 13) compared with those in the lowest tertile. This is the first prospective study showing that a healthy diet during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk for PPD. Additional longitudinal studies and trials are needed to confirm these findings.

"To evaluate blue-light attenuation in eyes with a tinted intraocular lens (IOL) or an untinted IOL. Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital of Crete, Crete, Greece. Comparative case series. Patients had lens extraction and implantation of an Acrysof Natural tinted or Tecnis ZA9003 or Softec III untinted acrylic IOL. The luminance ratio of green (530 nm) and blue (465 nm) light (green:blue ratio) required for isoluminant perception was determined by heterochromatic flicker photometry. Patients were tested preoperatively and 20 days postoperatively. The parafoveal measure of the green:blue ratio, expressed in decibels, is proportional to the blue-light attenuation by the lens. Twenty-two patients received the tinted IOL and 21 the untinted IOL. Preoperatively, age was strongly linearly correlated with the green:blue ratio (r = 0.59, P &lt; .001). The mean postoperative decrease in the green:blue ratio was greater in the untinted IOL group (P = .003). Postoperatively, the tinted IOL group had a significantly higher green:blue ratio than the untinted IOL group (P &lt; .001). In the tinted IOL group, the green:blue ratio was linearly related to IOL dioptric power. Less blue light reached the retina with tinted IOLs than with untinted IOLs. The absorption properties of tinted IOLs seemed to resemble those of the aging human crystalline lens, while untinted IOLs resembled the lower levels of blue-light attenuation of younger lenses. Thus, tinted IOLs may protect against the presumed blue-light hazard. No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned."

"To follow the epidemic of KPC-2-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Greece. KPC-2-producing isolates (n = 378) were collected during January 2009-April 2010 in 40 Greek hospitals. bla(KPC) and bla(VIM) were detected by PCR. Carbapenemase production was confirmed by spectrophotometry. Sequences flanking bla(KPC-2) and their plasmid carriers were studied. Isolates were typed by PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). All 378 isolates were bla(KPC-2) positive; 18 also carried bla(VIM-1/VIM-4). Higher isolation frequencies were observed in Athens and Crete. Isolates were classified into 13 PFGE types and 11 sequence types (STs). ST258 was predominant (n = 322), followed by ST147 (n = 20), ST383 (n = 9), ST133 (n = 6), ST274 (n = 4) and ST323 (n = 3). Of the remaining isolates, seven were distributed into five STs (11, 17, 340 and the novel 494 and 495) and seven were not typed. bla(KPC-2) could not be transferred from ST258 isolates, in contrast to isolates of ST17, ST133, ST147, ST274, ST494 and ST495. All bla(KPC-2)-encoding plasmids were of similar size (∼100 kb) and showed indistinguishable restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns except those from the ST340 isolates. Sequences flanking bla(KPC-2) revealed that the Tn4401a isoform was present in plasmids from all STs except ST340 containing Tn4401b. Co-production of VIM enzymes was observed in isolates of ST147, ST323 and ST383. Apart from the epidemic of KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae belonging to ST258 in Greece, diffusion of bla(KPC-2) to at least 10 additional STs has taken place. Notably, strains from three of the latter STs (147, 323 and 383) were found to carry both bla(KPC-2) and bla(VIM)."

Autoimmune diseases affect approximately 5% of the population, but much work remains to define the genetic risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms underlying these conditions. There is accumulating evidence that common genetic factors might predispose to multiple autoimmune disorders. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are complex autoimmune disorders with multiple susceptibility genes. The functional R620W (C1858T) polymorphism of the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene, a member of the PTPs that negatively regulate T-cell activation, has been recently associated with susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to assess whether the C1858T polymorphism of PTPN22 also confers increased risk for SLE and RA in the genetically homogeneous population of Crete. It was found that the minor T allele of the PTPN22 C1858T SNP was more common in SLE patients than in control individuals (odds ratio [OR] = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 3.9, p = 0.017). No significant difference was observed in the frequency of this allele when RA patients were compared with controls (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.9, p = 0.64). Although the PTPN22 1858 T allele is found at decreased frequency in Southern Europe, including Crete, an association was found between this allele and SLE in the population studied.

The prevalence of MetS according to the IDF and JIS definitions was significantly higher compared with that of the NCEP ATP III in both genders (IDF: P = .009 and P = .002, JIS: P = .002 and P = 0.001 for men and women, respectively); this was the case for the AHA-NHLBI definition only among women (P = .03). All MetS components differed significantly (P from &lt; .0001 to .02) between patients with and without MetS for all definitions. The prevalence of MetS varies considerably depending on the definition used in a hypertensive population in a Mediterranean country. These differences will influence risk assessment."

In Greece, mortality due to coronary artery disease has alarmingly increased during the past 3 decades, especially among younger adults between 30 and 40 years old. Many studies have been conducted over the years in an effort to interpret the presence of acute coronary phenomena-myocardial infarction, thrombosis, and sudden death-in early diagnosis and treatment. The current study focuses on postmortem data from individuals who had sudden coronary death. The coronary arteries of 100 individuals who were routinely subjected to autopsy at the Department of Forensic Sciences of the University of Crete were removed and examined, aiming at the evaluation of the degree of stenosis of the lumen and measurement of proportion of cholesterol in the plaque using Image Pro Plus 4.5. The average degree of stenosis was 79.01%, ranging from 11% to 99%. The cholesterol proportion was measured in 66 specimens, and the average was 25.05%, ranging between 5.3% and 66.3%, whereas 25 of them (37.8% overall) were found to contain cholesterol above the average. It resulted that the degree of stenosis was not of major importance in vulnerable plaques and that the amount of cholesterol followed an almost linear pattern of accumulation.

A reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used for detection of the RNA of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 120 samples of sera from Crete, which were positive for HCV-specific antibodies, by ELISA and Western blot analyses. A segment of 255 bp, located in the most conserved region of the HCV genome (the 5' untranslated region, 5' UTR), was amplified. For the identification of sequence variation from the HCV-1 strain, twenty of these samples were sequenced and compared to prototype strain (HCV-1) according to current genotypic classification. We were able to identify fourteen of the twenty as type 1a (i.e. similar to the prototype), two as type 1b, two as type 3a and two as type 4a. These findings generally agree with the geographic distribution of the already identified genotypes, though 3a type has not been reported previously in Crete (Greece).

"The use of cancer-related biomarkers in newborns has been very limited. We investigated the formation of micronuclei (MN) in full-term and preterm newborns and their mothers from the Rhea cohort (Crete), applying for the first time in cord blood a validated semiautomated analysis system, in both mono- and binucleated T lymphocytes. We assessed MN frequencies in peripheral blood samples from the mothers and in umbilical cord blood samples. We calculated MN in mononucleated (MNMONO) and binucleated (MNBN) T lymphocytes and the cytokinesis block proliferation index (CBPI) in 251 newborns (224 full term) and 223 mothers, including 182 mother-child pairs. Demographic and lifestyle characteristics were collected. We observed significantly higher MNBN and CBPI levels in mothers than in newborns. In newborns, MNMONO and MNBN were correlated (r = 0.35, p &lt; 0.001), and we found a moderate correlation between MNMONO in mothers and newborns (r = 0.26, p &lt; 0.001). MNMONO frequencies in newborns were positively associated with the mother's body mass index and inversely associated with gestational age and mother's age, but we found no significant predictors of MNBN or CBPI in newborns. Although confirmation is needed by a larger study population, the results indicate the importance of taking into account both mono- and binucleated T lymphocytes for biomonitoring of newborns, because the first reflects damage expressed during in vivo cell division and accumulated in utero, and the latter includes additional damage expressed as MN during the in vitro culture step."

"The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of cardiovascular and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) risk factors in adolescents and University students in Crete (Greece), according to different levels of snack consumption. 237 adolescents (14.2-16.3 years) and 196 University students (19.5-31.5 years) participated during 2002/3 and 2004/5. Dietary intake (24-h dietary recalls), cardiorespiratory fitness, smoking habits, time spent watching television, anthropometric, blood pressure and biochemical measurements were assessed in all subjects. Adolescents consumed snacks more often than University students (62% vs. 49.5%, P &lt; 0.05) and had significantly higher total energy intake (8629 vs. 7641 kJ, P &lt; 0.05) and energy intake from snacks (2537 vs. 1767 kJ, P &lt; 0.001). Snack consumers had higher energy intake than non-consumers in both groups. No relationship was found between snack consumption and MetSyn risk factors, cardiorespiratory fitness and smoking. However, University students who consumed snacks had 15.36 times higher risk of having ≥ 2 MetSyn risk factors than adolescent snack consumers, had considerably higher LDL-cholesterol levels, total: HDL-cholesterol ratio and watched more television than non-consumers. These findings emphasize the need for developing effective nutrition interventions to promote healthier snack choices in adolescents and young adults with characteristics similar to our sample, in order to prevent cardiovascular risk later in adulthood."

"	The yellow-flowered everlasting daisy Helichrysum italicum (Asteraceae, Gnaphalieae) is widely distributed in the Mediterranean basin, where it grows in continuous and widespread populations in diverse open habitats. Helichrysum italicum subsp. microphyllum has a disjunct distribution in the Balearic Islands (Majorca and Dragonera), Corsica, Sardinia, Crete and Cyprus. Numerous morphological intermediates between subsp. italicum and subsp. microphyllum are known from Corsica, where the two subspecies co-occur. The aims of the study were to investigate if subsp. microphyllum has a common origin, constituting an independent gene pool from subsp. italicum, or if the morphological differences between subsp. microphyllum and subsp. italicum have arisen independently in different locations from a common wider gene pool. Our analyses of AFLP, cpDNA sequences and morphological characters show that there is geographic structure to the genetic variation within H. italicum, with eastern and western Mediterranean groups, which do not correspond with the division into subsp. microphyllum and subsp. italicum as currently circumscribed. Local selection on quantitative trait loci provides sufficient explanation for the morphological divergence observed and is consistent with genetic data. Within the western Mediterranean group of the species we found considerable polymorphism in chloroplast DNA sequences among and within some populations. Comparison with chloroplast DNA sequences from other Helichrysum species showed that some chloroplast haplotypes are shared across species.

"The rs10994336 ANK3 and rs1006737 CACNA1C genetic variants have recently been identified as the most consistent, genome-wide significant risk factors for bipolar disorder, while the CACNA1C variant has also been associated with schizophrenia and major depression. The aim of this study was to examine the phenotypic consequences of the risk CACNA1C and ANK3 alleles in a large homogeneous cohort of healthy young males. We recruited 703 randomly selected, healthy army conscripts (mean age 22.1 ± 3.0 years) from the first wave of the Learning on Genetics of Schizophrenia project in Heraklion, Crete. Of those recruited, 530 subjects entered and completed the study. Subjects were assessed for prepulse inhibition (PPI), startle reactivity, neuropsychology, and personality.   UNPHASED analysis revealed that the rs1006737 A-allele was associated with lower extraversion and higher harm avoidance, trait anxiety, and paranoid ideation, while the rs10994336 T-allele was associated with lower novelty seeking and behavioral activation scores (p &lt; 0.01). Both alleles were associated with high startle reactivity (p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant associations with any cognitive task performance or PPI. The CACNA1C genotype was associated with proneness to anxiety and negative mood, while the ANK3 genotype was associated with proneness to anhedonia. Both risk genotypes were associated with high startle reactivity, suggesting a role of these polymorphisms in threat/stress signal processing, probably in the hippocampus and/or amygdala. None of the risk genotypes affected sensorimotor gating or behavioral performance in an extensive battery of executive function tests in this cohort of healthy males."

"Dietary intake of specific nutrients or food groups during pregnancy could influence fetal growth, but scant evidence is available on effects of dietary patterns. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence during pregnancy on fetal growth in two population-based mother-child cohorts in Spain and Greece. We studied 2461 mother-newborn pairs from the Spanish multi-centre 'INMA' study (Atlantic area: INMA-Atlantic; Mediterranean area: INMA-Mediterranean), and 889 pairs from the 'RHEA' study in Crete, Greece. Maternal diet during pregnancy was assessed by FFQ and MD adherence was evaluated through an a priori score. Fetal growth restriction was based on a customised model, and multivariate log-binomial and linear regression models were used to adjust for several confounders. MD scores differ significantly between the cohorts with women in INMA-Atlantic reporting higher intakes of fish and dairy products, while women in the Mediterranean area reported higher intakes of cereals, vegetables and fruits. Women with high MD adherence had a significantly lower risk of delivering a fetal growth-restricted infant for weight (risk ratios: 0·5; 95 % CI 0·3, 0·9) in the INMA-Mediterranean cohort. Stratified analysis by smoking revealed that higher MD adherence increased birth weight and birth length in smoking mothers, whereas this effect was not apparent in non-smoking mothers. The results of the present study show that several types of MD exist across European Mediterranean regions. High MD adherence may modify the detrimental effect of smoking on birth size, but overall effects of diet were not universal for the studies in this analysis."

"During pregnancy, women are at particular risk for sleep deprivation and snoring because of the physiologic and hormonal changes of pregnancy. There is limited evidence for the association between sleep patterns in pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes. We examined the association of sleep duration and snoring in late pregnancy with the risk of preterm birth and fetal growth restriction. We used data from the prospective mother-child cohort ""Rhea"" study in Crete, Greece 2007-2009. The analysis included 1091 women with singleton pregnancies, providing complete data on sleeping habits at the third trimester of gestation and birth outcomes. Fetal growth restriction was based on a customized model, and multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to adjust for confounders. Women with severe snoring were at high risk for low birth weight (relative risk = 2.6 [95% confidence interval = 1.2-5.4]), and fetal-growth-restricted neonates (2.0 [1.0-3.9]) after adjusting for maternal age, education, smoking during pregnancy, and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI). Women with sleep deprivation (≤5 hours sleep) were at high risk for preterm births (1.7 [1.1-2.8]), with the highest risk observed for medically indicated preterm births (2.4 [1.0-6.4]) after adjusting for maternal age, education, parity, smoking during pregnancy, and prepregnancy BMI. These findings suggest that women with severe snoring in late pregnancy have a higher risk for fetal-growth-restricted neonates; and women with sleep deprivation have a higher risk for preterm births. The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear."

"This random retrospective cross-sectional study was done to determine the incidence of uterine malformation in 4 groups of women desiring to conceive during their reproductive years, all of them living in La Crete, a community in Northern Alberta, Canada, with endogamous marriage practices in a 500 year old restricted gene pool. During 2003-2006, eight hundred women, suspected of having uterine malformation, were scanned using 2-D abdominal and transvaginal sonography (TVS). A sub-group of 156 patients was identified with suspected uterine malformations and referred for further diagnostic investigation, including MRI, 3-D sonography, hysterosalpingography, hysteroscopy and laparoscopy. This group included 30 women without previous pregnancies (Group 1), 31 women with previous pregnancies and live births (fertile) (Group 2), 40 women with live births and more than 2 miscarriages (Group 3) and 55 women with recurrent miscarriages (infertile) (Group 4). The overall frequency of uterine malformations was recorded at 19.5% in La Crete women. Ninety five women with recurrent or some miscarriages had more uterine malformation than the other groups. The incidence in Groups 3 and 4 (infertile) was 60.8% and 39.2% in the fertile Groups 1 and 2. The p &lt;0.01 was significant at 95% confidence interval. This study has provided new insights into the increasing number of uterine malformations in the population of La Crete. It was 19.5%, 5.5 times higher than that of the general population of (0.1% to 3.5%). This might indicate an increase in uterine malformations among women in a restricted gene pool community. A combination of TVS, hysterosalpingography, 3-D sonography and MRI are necessary for the precise classification of uterine malformations. Uterine malformations are not rare, but may be increasingly related to consanguinity. The finding of uterine malformation is more frequent in patients with recurrent miscarriages, especially women with septated, unicornuate, or didelphys uteri."

"Atypical melanocytic nevi constitute central risk factor and are precursor lesions for cutaneous melanoma. Data regarding factors associated with their prevalence are mainly derived from fair-skinned populations, whereas little is known regarding their epidemiological associations in darker-skinned, chronically sun-exposed populations. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for the occurrence of at least one atypical nevus on Crete, the southernmost island of Greece. This hospital-based case-control study included 143 patients and 189 controls with at least one atypical nevus presented at the pigmented skin lesion clinic of the University of Crete. All participants were interviewed and underwent complete skin examination by the same two experienced dermatologists. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for potential confounders. In the multivariate analysis, common melanocytic nevi [odds ratio (OR): of 2.2, 7.5, and 58.9 for the presence of 11-25, 26-100, and &gt;100 common nevi, respectively] and recreational sun exposure (OR: 4.4) increased significantly the risk of the presence of atypical nevus. A decreased risk for atypical nevi was related to an increasing age (OR: 0.96/age), and professional sun exposure (OR: 0.5). Intermittent, recreational sun exposure is mainly associated with the prevalence of atypical nevi in our sample and this effect does not depend on skin phototype. Promotion of sun protection, especially in patients with high numbers of common nevi, might serve as a measure to prevent the development of atypical nevi."

A multi-analytical technique approach. 	Wall paintings spanning two millennia of Cretan painting history and technology were analysed in an effort to determine similarities and evolutions of painting materials and technology. A multi-technique approach was employed that combined the use of (a) laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman microspectroscopy, based on mobile instrumentation, appropriate for rapid, routine-level object characterization, and (b) non-destructive X-ray diffractometry (XRD), performed directly on the wall painting fragment, which provides detailed information on the minerals constituting the paint. Elemental analysis data obtained through LIBS were compared with molecular and crystal structure information from Raman spectroscopy and XRD. Cross-sections from selected samples were also investigated by means of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled to micro-probe analysis and X-ray mapping that enabled identification of several mineral components of the paint confirming the results of the XRD analysis. In parallel, replica wall paintings, created with known pigments and binding media for reference purposes, were examined with optical microscopy and stain tested for organic materials. The overall study shows that the LIBS and Raman techniques offer key advantages, such as instrument mobility and speed of data collection and interpretation that are particularly important when dealing with on-site investigations. Thus, they are capable of providing important compositional information in an effective manner that enables quick surveying of wall paintings and permit targeted sample selection for further analysis by advanced laboratory techniques.

Animal manure amended soils often contain large amounts of bioavailable phosphorus (P) and constitute high risk for the deterioration of surface water quality through eutrophication. Current standards set for the safe disposal of animal manure through soil application are based on the assumption that phosphorus in all P sources would behave similarly. The primary objective of this study was to understand the influence of P from several manure and mineral fertilizer sources applied at 0, 50, and 150 mg P kg(-1) on two measures of bioavailable P to six soils of different initial soil test P levels using corn (Zea mays L.) P uptake and an iron oxide strip method for soil analysis (FeO-P). Total net bioavailable P (TNBP) was calculated by subtracting total P uptake by corn after seven consecutive harvests in control treatments that did not receive P from the P uptake from P-amended treatments. Net biovavailable P after the first harvest (NBP1) was calculated in a similar fashion but only using data from the first harvest. Significant differences in TNBP and NBP1 were found when comparing P sources. The hog (Sus scrofa) manure had the greatest P bioavailability while turkey (Meleagris gallopava) litter had the lowest among the animal P sources across all soils and levels of P application. Significant differences were also found between soils with the highest amounts of TNBP and NBP1 found in the Woodson soil and lowest detected in the Crete soil for most P sources. The FeO-P method was useful in predicting TNBP from most P sources.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) levels were assessed in human hair samples, originating from two main agricultural regions of Greece. The analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-double focusing high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-DFHRMS). The main analytical procedure involved hair decontamination, solid-liquid extraction and cleanup steps. The recoveries of PCBs ranged from 71.2% to 101.6%, with accuracies greater than 87.5% and the between-run precisions (%RSD) lower than 25% for all analytes. Differences in the frequencies of detection and the median values of PCBs were detected between the examined regions and between the applied analytical techniques. All Peloponnesus' hair examined samples were found positive for each examined PCB, while the percentage of the total positive samples ranged from 86.1% (for PCB 138) to 94.4% (for PCB 28 and 153 congeners) using GC-DFHRMS. The Cretan hair samples were less contaminated (SUM PCBs=0.61 and 1.47pg/mg) unlike the Peloponnesus' samples (SUM PCBs=24.68 and 38.74pg/mg) measured by GC-DFHRMS and GC-MS, respectively. PCBs with high chlorination gave lower concentration values compared to low chlorination PCBs in both populations. No significant differences were observed between women and men. The GC-DFHRMS technique provided higher percentage of positive samples and low PCBs median values, due to higher sensitivity and interferences from isobaric ions in the GC-MS technique and is therefore considered as a powerful tool for such assessments in hair specimens.

A cross-sectional study from rural Crete, Greece. 	"Patients often have multiple chronic diseases, use multiple prescriptions and over the counter medications resulting in polypharmacy. Many of them store these medications for future use in their homes, rather than take them as directed by their physician, resulting in a waste of health care resources, and potentially dangerous misuse. This study aimed to investigate the magnitude of medication home hoarding, the exchange of medication with family/friends, families' beliefs about the medication use, source of medication, pharmaceutical class, cost of stored medicine and conditions of storage. A structured questionnaire was administered within the homes in two rural areas in Crete. Forty families participated in the study including 85 individual household members (36 men, and 49 women with an average age of 56.5 ± 24.3 mean ± SD). There were a total of 557 medications recorded, with 324 different medications representing a total value of €8954. The mean quantity of medication boxes stored in each home was 8.5 ± 5.8. Cardiovascular medications accounted for 56% of medications for current use; whereas analgesics (24%), and antibiotics (17%), were the most medications being stored for future use. Exchange of medicine was very common (95%). Beliefs that 'more expensive medication is more effective', and that 'over the counter medications are safe because they were easily available' were expressed. Medications are being stored in large quantities in these rural areas, with a large percentage of them being wasted or misused."

Widespread species have the potential to reveal large-scale biogeographical patterns, as well as responses to environmental changes possibly unique to habitat generalists. This study presents a continental-scale phylogeographical analysis of Polyommatus icarus, one of the most common Palaearctic butterflies, and the morphologically and ecologically similar Polyommatus celina, a recently discovered cryptic species. By combining data from mitochondrial [cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)] and nuclear [internal transcribed spacer (ITS2)] molecular markers with geometric morphometrics, we document a complex phylogeographical history for the two species. Despite morphological similarities, the genetic divergence between these two species is high (more than 5% at COI) and they are not sister species. For the first time, we show that P. celina occurs not only in North Africa but also in Europe, where it inhabits several west Mediterranean islands, as well as large parts of Iberia, where it occurs in parapatry with P. icarus. The two species appear to completely exclude each other on islands, but we provide morphological and molecular evidence that introgression occurred in the Iberian Peninsula. We discovered strongly diverged lineages that seem to represent relict populations produced by past range expansions and contractions: Crete and Iberian isolates for P. icarus, Balearics-Sardinia and Sicily-Lipari for P. celina. This study shows that a combined genetic-morphometric approach can shed light on cryptic diversity while providing the necessary resolution to reconstruct a fine-scale phylogeographical history of species at both spatial and temporal levels.

"This study investigated the alcohol consumption of secondary education students and their relationship to school life and leisure time use with peers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in March 2007, and the study population consisted of 14- to 19-year-old students living in an agricultural area of Crete. The final sample consisted of 117 individuals (response rate 90.0%). A short previously validated self-completion questionnaire was used collecting information on: personal and family characteristics; school progress; leisure time activities and relations with other adolescents; and alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption differed significantly between male (75.5%) and female (25.8%) students (P &lt; 0.001). Almost half of the participants (48.3%) reported alcohol consumption during nights out with friends. The mean grade for the previous year for students consuming alcohol was lower compared with those who did not, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.066). Statistical evidence supported the hypothesis that students who consumed alcohol had more absences and this association was stronger for male students. The frequency of alcohol consumption was found to relate to the number of absences for both sexes. Male students who had been suspended from school were more likely to drink alcohol than those who had not been suspended. Statistical evidence also supported the hypotheses that students who spent their free time in cafeterias, bars or billiard halls were more likely to drink alcohol and also consume alcohol at higher frequencies than those that did not spend their free time this way (P = 0.002 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). More health education programmes and actions are needed at the national and local level to help students, families, schools, communities and the state better understand the real dimensions of the problem."

Do we need local guidelines? 	In the management of acute diarrhea, administration of antibiotics may be indicated. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy can shorten illness, reduce morbidity and can be life-saving in invasive infections. Emergence of microbial strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics means that treatment failures may become common. Because of changing patterns of resistance, knowledge of recent local patterns of susceptibility can guide the initial choice of antibiotics. A retrospective study was conducted to investigate the epidemiology of infective gastroenteritis in patients over 14years old in the region of Chania (Crete). We reviewed all positive stool cultures and susceptibilities of the pathogens recovered from patients with symptoms of acute diarrhea, from 2003 until October 2010. Out of 194 positive stool cultures, we observed 139 cases of Salmonella enterica and 48 cases of Campylobacter jejuni. During the last 3years of observation there was an increased incidence of C. jejuni, especially after the tap water outbreak that occurred in our region in 2009. In the vast majority of acute diarrhea in adults, antibiotics are of no benefit and overprescription may confer to side effects, costs and emergence of resistance. Antibiotics are initiated in cases of febrile diarrheas especially those believed to have moderate to severe disease. Considering the increased incidence of C. jejuni and the resistance of the great majority of isolated strains to quinolones as well as the sensitivity of Salmonella spp. to azithromycin, administration of azithromycin empirically for acute diarrhea, when indicated, could be appropriate in our region.

To describe the clinical significance and antibiotic susceptibilities of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) isolated from patients in Crete, Greece between January 2000 and December 2009. NTM identification was performed using conventional bacteriological methods and confirmed by molecular characterization with commercially available assays. Rare and novel species were identified by sequencing of the 16SrRNA and of the hsp65 genes. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by E-test. Rapidly growing (RGM) and slowly growing (SGM) NTM were tested against 14 antimicrobials, including nine common ones, except for Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare (MAC) complex isolates that were tested only against azithromycin, clarithromycin, linezolid and moxifloxacin. During the study period, 290 positive samples for NTM were recovered from 207 patients. Among the positive samples, 150 were identified as SGM and 57 as RGM. Overall, 50 patients met American Thoracic Society criteria for disease due to NTM, 42 by SGM and eight by RGM. Risk factors in patients with NTM disease were underlying lung diseases, mainly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, smoking, rheumatoid arthritis, AIDS, alcohol or drug abuse, malignancies and bronchiectasis. The most common disease-causing species were the MAC complex (n = 25) followed by Mycobacterium kansasii (n = 10). Amikacin was the most active drug for RGM with 100% susceptibility. Macrolides were very active against isolates of the MAC complex, while tigecycline had excellent activity in vitro against RGM. M. kansasii was the most susceptible NTM species in vitro. Our study is the first to describe the clinical significance, risk factors and susceptibility patterns of NTM isolates in a Greek population.

"To assess secular changes in physical fitness (PF), moderate-to-vigorous-physical activity (MVPA) and TV-viewing in 1st-grade children from Crete, Greece. Cross-sectional cohorts examined in academic years 1992/93 and 2006/07. Two representative samples of children, aged 5.9-7.8 years, were studied during 1992/93 (N=606) and 2006/07 (N=361). PF (sit-and-reach, standing-broad-jump, sit-ups and 20 m-shuttle-run-test) was assessed by the European-PF test battery and MVPA by a physical activity (PA) questionnaire. Data on the frequency of TV-viewing was also collected. Between 1992/93 and 2006/07, there was a significant increase in all fitness tests in both genders (P&lt;0.001) and in MVPA in boys (76.5 min/week vs. 38.7 min/week, P&lt;0.001). Time spent watching TV on weekdays was significantly more in both genders in 2006/07, compared to 1992/93 (P&lt;0.001). In 2006/07, active boys and active girls spent more time in MVPA than active boys and girls in 1992/93 (P&lt;0.001). Significantly higher proportions of boys and girls engaged in vigorous activities in 2006/07, than 1992/93 (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.027, respectively). A significant increase in physical and cardiorespiratory fitness in both genders and MVPA in boys was observed in children from Crete between 1992/93 and 2006/07. The increase in weekday TV-viewing, despite being parallel to an increase in leisure-time MVPA, could have an unfavorable effect on health and should be tackled in future interventions in this population. Dietary, anthropometric and biochemical indices should also be investigated to assess their impact on the secular changes in physical fitness and activity observed in this sample of children."

"Ancient DNA methodologies can be applied in the investigation of the genetics of extinct populations. A search for beta thalassemia mutations was performed on 49 Minoan individuals from the Bronze Age who were living in the island of Crete approximately 4000 Years Before Present (YBP). Standard precautionary measures were employed in the laboratory to ensure authenticity of the DNA extracted from the ancient bones, resulting in the successful analysis of DNA of 24 Minoans. DNA sequencing focused on the Intervening Sequence 1 (IVS-1) of the beta globin gene and its splicing junctions. 63% of the thalassemia mutations observed among modern Cretans reside in beta IVS-1. None of the Minoan individuals carried one of the IVS-1 mutations known to cause beta thalassemia; however, only one was expected to be observed if the average frequency of beta thalassemia heterozygotes in the Minoan population was the same with that of modern day Cretans (7.6%). One individual contained a C to G substitution in position 91 of the IVS-1, located 40 bp 5' to the intron 1/exon 2 junction. Functional studies indicated that the mutation did not affect mRNA splicing or stability, and most likely represented an innocent single nucleotide polymorphism."

Studies on determinants affecting child development are still limited in Greece. The aim of the present study was to describe the socio-demographic characteristics associated with neurodevelopment in infants aged 18 months in the Mother-Child Cohort (Rhea Study) in Crete, Greece. A total of 599 (72.9%) mothers agreed to participate in the neurodevelopment protocol and 612 infants (586 singletons and 26 twins) were assessed by means of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (3rd edition). The present analysis includes 605 infants. Multivariable linear regression models were implemented to examine the associations between the Bayley-III standardised scores and different parental and infant characteristics, also adjusting for quality of assessment. Girls were found to have better neurodevelopmental outcomes in cognitive, receptive and expressive communication, fine motor and social-emotional development. Maternal higher education was positively associated to almost all aspects of infant neurodevelopment assessed. Increasing number of older siblings was negatively associated with cognitive development, communication skills and gross motor development. Our results, also, suggest a positive effect of maternal employment on infants' receptive and expressive communication, and gross motor scores. The results of the present study suggest that in the population on Crete social and environmental factors contributed more to infants' neurodevelopment at 18 months than biological factors.

This cohort study aimed to estimate the effect of individual maternal social capital during pregnancy on birth outcomes in the context of the Mother-child cohort (Rhea study), in Crete-Greece. Women were recruited from four prenatal clinics in Heraklion-Crete for one year beginning in February 2007. 610 women completed the self-administered Social Capital Questionnaire at about the 24th week of gestation. The scale assessed total maternal social capital and four social capital subscales: Participation in the Community, Feelings of Safety, Value of Life and Social Agency, and Tolerance of Diversity. Potential confounders included characteristics that have an established or potential association with the maternal social capital, and the birth outcomes (preterm birth, small weight for the gestational age, fetal weight growth restriction, weight, length and head circumference). The results of logistic and linear regression models indicated that there was an increase in the risk of preterm birth for every unit increase in maternal participation (range 12-48), and especially in the risk of medically indicated preterm birth. Although the findings suggest that participation is associated with an increased probability for preterm birth, we cannot know whether this is a protective or damaging social capital effect. Women who participate more in their communities may have enhanced access to information and/or resources, easier access to health care and support when they face maternal and fetal conditions that trigger the need for medical intervention. On the other hand, women may be more exposed to social and/or environmental stressors. Future research needs to distinguish between different types of participation and different components of social capital to better understand their associations with birth outcomes.

"Although corticosteroid use in acute hemorrhagic stroke is not widely adopted, management with intravenous dexamethasone has been standard of care at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete with observed outcomes superior to those reported in the literature. To explore this further, we conducted a retrospective, multivariable-adjusted 2-center study. We studied 391 acute hemorrhagic stroke cases admitted to the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete between January 1997 and July 2010 and compared them with 510 acute hemorrhagic stroke cases admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, from January 2003 to September 2009. Of the Cretan cases, 340 received a tapering scheme of intravenous dexamethasone, starting with 16 to 32 mg/day, whereas the Boston patients were managed without steroids. The 2 cohorts had comparable demographics and stroke severity on admission, although anticoagulation was more frequent in Boston. The in-hospital mortality was significantly lower on Crete (23.8%, n=340) than in Boston (38.0%, n=510; P&lt;0.001) as was the 30-day mortality (Crete: 25.4%, n=307; Boston: 39.4%, n=510; P&lt;0.001). Exclusion of patients on anticoagulants showed even greater differences (30-day mortality: Crete 20.8%; n=259; Boston 37.0%; n=359; P&lt;0.001). The improved survival on Crete was observed 3 days after initiation of intravenous dexamethasone and was pronounced for deep-seated hemorrhages. After adjusting for acute hemorrhagic stroke volume/location, Glasgow Coma Scale, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, coronary artery disease and statin, antiplatelet, and anticoagulant use, intravenous dexamethasone treatment was associated with better functional outcomes and significantly lower risk of death at 30 days (OR, 0.357; 95% CI, 0.174-0.732). This study suggests that intravenous dexamethasone improves outcome in acute hemorrhagic stroke and supports a randomized clinical trial using this approach."

"The purpose of the Fifth International Hydrocephalus Workshop was to allow clinicians and basic science researchers to educate each other in the advances that have been and are being made in the understanding and treatment of hydrocephalus and related disorders. This vision of the meeting was the work of Dr. Anthony Marmarou, who died a few months before the meeting was held. The presentations on all aspects of the study of hydrocephalus can be roughly grouped into seven basic themes. These themes are a summary of the important lifelong work of Professor Marmarou himself, including mathematical modeling, clinical selection of patients for the treatment of normal pressure hydrocephalus, and the development of international guidelines for the management of this condition. Other themes included the gathering of data, and in particular, randomized controlled trials; the use of magnetic resonance imaging for basic research in hydrocephalus, basic science and in particular the role of aquaporins; reports on clinical studies; and the late outcomes for patients treated in infancy. Finally, a report on the development of a consensus on the definition and classification of hydrocephalus based on the point of obstruction to flow of cerebrospinal fluid was presented. "

In this work, the elemental content (C, N, H, S, O), the organic matter content and the calorific value of various organic components that are commonly found in the municipal solid waste stream were measured. The objective of this work was to develop an empirical equation to describe the calorific value of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste as a function of its elemental composition. The MSW components were grouped into paper wastes, food wastes, yard wastes and plastics. Sample sizes ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 kg. In addition to the above individual components, commingled municipal solid wastes were sampled from a bio-drying facility located in Crete (sample sizes ranged from 8 to 15 kg) and were analyzed for the same parameters. Based on the results of this work, an improved empirical model was developed that revealed that carbon, hydrogen and oxygen were the only statistically significant predictors of calorific value. Total organic carbon was statistically similar to total carbon for most materials in this work. The carbon to organic matter ratio of 26 municipal solid waste substrates and of 18 organic composts varied from 0.40 to 0.99. An approximate chemical empirical formula calculated for the organic fraction of commingled municipal solid wastes was C(32)NH(55)O(16).

"Research has indicated that general practitioners (GPs) have good clinical judgment in regards to diagnosing and managing herpes zoster (HZ) within clinical practice in a country with limited resources for primary care and general practice. The objective of the current study was to assess the burden of HZ and post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) within rural general practices in Crete, Greece. The current study took place within a rural setting in Crete, Greece during the period of November 2007 to November 2009 within the catchment area in which the Cretan Rural Practice-based Research Network is operating. In total 19 GP's from 14 health care units in rural Crete were invited to participate, covering a total turnover patient population of approximately 25, 000 subjects. For the purpose of this study an electronic record database was constructed and used as the main tool for monitoring HZ and PHN incidence. Stress related data was also collected with the use of the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST). The crude incidence rate of HZ was 1.4/1000 patients/year throughout the entire network of health centers and satellite practices, while among satellite practices alone it was calculated at 1.3/1000 patients/year. Additionally, the standardised incidence density within satellite practices was calculated at 1.6/1000 patients/year. In regards to the stress associated with HZ and PHN, the latter were found to have lower levels of anxiety, as assessed through the SAST score (17.4 ± 3.9 vs. 21.1 ± 5.7; p = 0.029). The implementation of an electronic surveillance system was feasible so as to measure the burden of HZ and PHN within the rural general practice setting in Crete."

"	"Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody indicated as an add-on treatment for severe allergic asthma, inadequately controlled despite high dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting b2-agonists. Medical registries were used to evaluate the 4 months, 1 and 4 years effectiveness of omalizumab treatment, in a non-interventional, observational ""real-life"" study. Sixty patients with severe persistent allergic asthma from 5 South-Eastern Mediterranean centres from Crete and Cyprus were evaluated. Effectiveness outcomes included spirometry, severe asthma exacerbations rate, level of asthma control (ACT), and additional asthma medication (inhaled steroids). Outcome variables improved after 4 months and sustained after 1 and 4 years treatment with Omalizumab. FEV1 improved statistically significant at all time points versus baseline [ΔFEV1 (% pred.) = +21 p = 0.008 at 4 months, ΔFEV1 (% pred.) = +24.5 p &lt; 0.0001 at 4 years after treatment]. Similarly, FVC increased statistically significant versus baseline [ΔFVC (% pred.) = +20 p = 0.002 at 4 months, ΔFVC (% pred.) = +22.6 p = 0.0002 at 4 years]. The level of asthma control as evaluated by ACT was significantly improved after treatment (+12% p = 0.001 at 4 months, +24% p &lt; 0.0001 at 4 years). Omalizumab treatment reduced significantly asthma exacerbations rate (-65% p = 0.0002 at 1 year, and -70% p &lt; 0.0001 at 4 years). The use of inhaled steroids decreased statistically significant after 4 months (p = 0.017), 1 year (p = 0.029) and 4 years (p = 0.014) of omalizumab treatment. This long-term ""real-life"" study demonstrated significant improvement in lung function and other clinical outcomes after omalizumab treatment, evident at 4 months, and sustained after 1 and 4 years suggesting its efficacy in severe allergic asthma, in the ""real-life"" practice."

Fulfillment of extensive questionnaires and estimation of free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and antithyroid antibodies were performed. The reference population was defined using inclusion criteria regarding thyroidal, obstetric, and general medical status of women. Reference interval for TSH was 0.05-2.53 μIU/mL for the first and 0.18-2.73 μIU/mL for the second trimester. 6,8% and 5,9% of women in the first and second trimester, respectively, had TSH higher than the upper reference limit. These trimester-specific population-based reference ranges are essential in everyday clinical practice for the correct interpretation of thyroid hormone values and accurate classification of thyroid disorders."

"In this study, we investigated the long-term trends in the epidemiology and susceptibility of bacterial enteropathogens among children in a well-defined area of adequate health standards. The study included all children younger than 14 years of age treated for enteritis at Heraklion University General Hospital on the island of Crete during the 18-year period from January 1993 to December 2010. Stool specimens were tested for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Yersinia, and Aeromonas species. Of the 33,032 stool samples from patients of any age, 2,912 (8.82%) were positive for bacterial enteropathogens. The 1,597 isolates from children were identified as S. enterica (42.3%), Campylobacter spp. (33.6%), EPEC (17.4%), Y. enterocolitica (5.82%), A. hydrophila (0.44%), and Shigella spp. (0.38%). A decline in prevalence was observed for all bacterial enteropathogens. Taken as a total, enteropathogens were susceptible to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, and amoxicillin in 98.8%, 88.0%, 83.0%, 67.1%, and 59.6%, respectively. During the study period, the susceptibility rates decreased for co-trimoxazole (p&lt;0.0001) and ciprofloxacin (p&lt;0.001), and increased for amoxicillin (p&lt;0.0001). Our findings suggest declining long-term trends in the prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens and changes in susceptibility rates to first-line antibacterial agents. These changing trends in the long-term morbidity and susceptibility call for ongoing surveillance and tailored management."

To assess the in vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) ocular isolates to antibiotics, and identify changing trends in resistance over a 10-year period. All isolates from ocular infections collected between 2000 and 2009 were prospectively tested against several antibiotics in vitro. S. pneumoniae isolates (n = 93) were tested against 20 and S. aureus (n = 120) and CoNS (n = 214) against 19 antibiotics. To identify changes in susceptibility patterns, we compared results from 2000-2004 with those from 2005-2009. We also compared the antibiotic susceptibilities against aminoglycosides and quinolones between methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates. All S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to quinolones, and 99% were susceptible to chloramphenicol. Regarding S. aureus, we noted a significant increase in resistance against penicillin in recent years (p = 0.016). Over 90% of S. aureus isolates were susceptible to quinolones and aminoglycosides. MRSA isolates were more resistant to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin than MSSA isolates were (p = 0.016). Concerning CoNS, a significant increase in susceptibility to amikacin was noted in the second study period (p = 0.01). Quinolones remain an excellent treatment option for bacterial conjunctivitis and keratitis due to Gram-positive cocci in our region.

"Leishmaniases are vector-borne diseases transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. Three species of Leishmania are found in the Mediterranean basin: Leishmania infantum, the most common species responsible for both visceral (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL); Leishmania major, found in North Africa and Middle East causing CL; Leishmania tropica with a limited presence in Europe, causing CL. During the last 25 years, Crete has become an endemic zone for L. infantum with a high number of infected dogs and an increasing number of human cases every year; in the last 4 years, the incidence has reached an average of seven VL patients per year in a population of 600,000. At the same time, CL has re-emerged in Crete due to L. tropica, with an average of three CL cases per year in the last 4 years. Isolates were typed as L. infantum MON-1 and MON-98 and L. tropica MON-300, a zymodeme not reported before. Both VL and CL have spread to the whole of the island during the last 25 years, primarily in semi-urban and urban areas with altitudes of 0-50 m. The prevailing Phlebotomus species were Phlebotomus neglectus (proven vector of L. infantum) and Phlebotomus similis (suspected vector of L. tropica)."

"Although Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most prevalent congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract, it has varied presentations and often becomes a diagnostic challenge. The purpose of this study was to review the diverse presentations of MD, record the epidemiologic features for Crete and review the detection techniques and the treatment options. This was a review of the records of all children who underwent surgery for MD in the department of Paediatric Surgery of the University Hospital of Crete (Greece) between January 1999 and January 2009. A total of 45 patients (32 male and 13 female) aged 1 to 13 years (median 10 years) with a diagnosis of MD were retrospectively reviewed. The collected data were analysed, looking at age, gender, clinical features, investigations, histopathological findings and surgical interventions. In 25 patients, MD was an incidental finding at laparotomy because of appendicitis. The remaining 20 patients were symptomatic and presented with various clinical features. Nine patients (19.9%) had clinical features of peritonitis; of these, three had perforated MD and six had Meckel's diverticulitis at laparotomy. Four patients were diagnosed with intestinal obstruction. Seven patients (15.5%) presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Ultrasound scans revealed intussusception in three patients, requiring open reduction. The remaining four patients with bleeding per rectum underwent a Meckel's Tc99 scan that showed a positive tracer. All patients with MD underwent Meckel's diverticulectomy with appendicectomy. MD has an incidence of approximately 1 to 2% in our population. It is necessary to maintain a high index of suspicion in the diagnosis of MD paediatric age group because it can be easily misdiagnosed."

As part of the 'Rhea' mother childbirth cohort in Crete, Greece, 1317 mother-child pairs were followed-up until delivery, while among a subsample, maternal urine was assessed for its NNAL (n=117) and cotinine concentrations (n=377). Pregnant women who continued to smoke during pregnancy were found to have geometric mean urinary NNAL concentrations of 0.612 pmol/ml, in comparison to the 0.100 pmol/ml of ex-smokers and 0.0795 pmol/ml of non-smokers exposed to SHS. Exposure to SHS in the home was associated with a 4.40 ng/ml increase in urinary cotinine levels, while reported exposure to SHS in cars was associated with an even higher (8.73 ng/ml) increase in cotinine concentrations and was strongly related to NNAL concentrations. Exposure to SHS in the workplace and in public places was also shown to increase cotinine and NNAL concentrations. The NNAL:cotinine ratio was found to be higher among pregnant women who were exposed to SHS but did not smoke (p&lt;0.001). Using cotinine levels as an indicator of NNK, exposure due to SHS during pregnancy leads to an underestimation of exposure to NNK uptake. Moreover, each source of exposure contributed to the increase in cotinine levels, indicating the importance of avoiding SHS exposure from any source."

The public health effect of financial crises has been emphasized in previous studies. In addition, a series of otorhinolaryngologic disorders and manifestations has been related to psychological factors in the literature. Such conditions include temporomandibular joint disorders, laryngopharyngeal reflux, chronic tinnitus, and vertigo. Focusing on the outpatient database records of a large hospital in Crete, Greece, the objective of this retrospective study was to explore possible occurrence variations within the prementioned otorhinolaryngologic morbidity which may be potentially attributed to increased levels of socioeconomic stress. Results revealed that although the total number of visits between two periods - before and after the beginning of the financial crisis in Greece - was comparable, a significant increase in the diagnosis of two disorders, namely vertigo and tinnitus was found. In addition, a trend toward increased rate of diagnosis for reflux and temporomandibular joint disorders was noted. Potential implications of these findings are discussed. In conclusion, health care providers in this as well as in other countries facing similar socio-economic conditions should be aware of potential changes in the epidemiologic figures regarding specific medical conditions.

Collection and testing by IFA of 493 sample sera for IgG and IgM antibodies against C. bumetii phase II antigen indicated a prevalence of IgG antibodies of 48.7%. Of the seropositive individuals, 34% also revealed IgM seropositive antibody titers. Analysis of 225 sample sera by IFA from high risk population presented a prevalence for C. burnetii of 62.2%. Our findings revealed that C. burnetii is highly endemic in Crete, indicating a high exposure of the population to the pathogen regardless of occupation or place of residence.

We investigated the molecular diversity of the major agricultural pest Bemisia tabaci and of its associated secondary endosymbionts in Greece. Analyzing mitochondrial DNA, we found that the Q1 (=Q west) is predominant. We used eight microsatellite polymorphic markers to study the genetic structure of 37 populations from mainland and insular Greece, collected on different host species from outdoor and protected crops as well as from non-cultivated plants. In some cases, gene flow was found to be low even between populations separated by just a few kilometres. Bayesian analysis identified two main genetic groups, the first encompassing populations from south Crete and the second composed of populations from north Crete, two other Aegean islands and mainland Greece. Genetic differentiation was not correlated with different host plant species or habitat, or greenhouse versus open environment populations. Gene flow significantly decreased with geographic distance, but no isolation by distance existed when only the samples from mainland Greece or only the samples from Crete were considered. The secondary symbionts Wolbachia and Hamiltonella were present at high frequencies while Arsenophonus, Cardinium and Rickettsia were absent from Greek populations. Multilocus sequence typing of Wolbachia identified two Wolbachia strains. These two strains were found together in most of the populations studied but never in the same host individual. Their role on the observed population structure is discussed.

"In sparsely monitored basins, accurate mapping of the spatial variability of groundwater level requires the interpolation of scattered data. This paper presents a comparison of deterministic interpolation methods, i.e. inverse distance weight (IDW) and minimum curvature (MC), with stochastic methods, i.e. ordinary kriging (OK), universal kriging (UK) and kriging with Delaunay triangulation (DK). The study area is the Mires Basin of Mesara Valley in Crete (Greece). This sparsely sampled basin has limited groundwater resources which are vital for the island's economy; spatial variations of the groundwater level are important for developing management and monitoring strategies. We evaluate the performance of the interpolation methods with respect to different statistical measures. The Spartan variogram family is applied for the first time to hydrological data and is shown to be optimal with respect to stochastic interpolation of this dataset. The three stochastic methods (OK, DK and UK) perform overall better than the deterministic counterparts (IDW and MC). DK, which is herein for the first time applied to hydrological data, yields the most accurate cross-validation estimate for the lowest value in the dataset. OK and UK lead to smooth isolevel contours, whilst DK and IDW generate more edges. The stochastic methods deliver estimates of prediction uncertainty which becomes highest near the southeastern border of the basin. "

"To investigate whether high doses of folic acid supplementation in early pregnancy are associated with child neurodevelopment at 18 months of age. The study uses data from the prospective mother-child cohort 'Rhea' study. Pregnant women completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire on folic acid supplementation at 14-18 weeks of gestation. Neurodevelopment at 18 months was assessed with the use of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (3rd edition). Red-blood-cell folate concentrations in cord blood were measured in a sub-sample of the study population (n 58). Heraklion, Crete, Greece, 2007-2010. Five hundred and fifty-three mother-child pairs participating in the 'Rhea' cohort. Sixty-eight per cent of the study participants reported high doses of supplemental folic acid use (5 mg/d), while 24 % reported excessive doses of folic acid (&gt;5 mg/d) in early pregnancy. Compared with non-users, daily intake of 5 mg supplemental folic acid was associated with a 5-unit increase on the scale of receptive communication and a 3·5-unit increase on the scale of expressive communication. Doses of folic acid supplementation higher than 5 mg/d were not associated with additional increase in the neurodevelopmental scales. This is the first prospective study showing that high doses of supplementary folic acid in early pregnancy may be associated with enhanced vocabulary development, communicational skills and verbal comprehension at 18 months of age. Additional longitudinal studies and trials are needed to confirm these results."

"The reevaluation of ""forgotten"" antibiotics can identify new therapeutic options against extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We sought to investigate isepamicin in this regard. We retrospectively evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of Enterobacteriaceae sp. isolates from unique patients, collected at the microbiological laboratory of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, from 2004 to 2009. Susceptibility testing was done with the automated Vitek 2 system. The breakpoints for susceptibility to isepamicin, tigecycline, and other antibiotics were those proposed by the Comité de l'Antibiogramme de la Société Française de Microbiologie (CA-SFM), the FDA, and the CLSI, respectively. A total of 6,296 isolates were studied, including primarily 3,401 (54.0%) Escherichia coli, 1,040 (16.5%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 590 (9.4%) Proteus mirabilis, and 460 (7.3%) Enterobacter sp. isolates. Excluding the species with intrinsic resistance to each antibiotic, antimicrobial susceptibility was highest for colistin (5,275/5,441 isolates [96.9%]) and isepamicin (6,103/6,296 [96.9%]), followed by meropenem (5,890/6,296 [93.6%]), imipenem (5,874/6,296 [93.3%]), and amikacin (5,492/6,296 [87.2%]). The antimicrobial susceptibility of the 1,040 K. pneumoniae isolates was highest for isepamicin (95.3%), followed by colistin (89.3%) and meropenem (63.0%). Regarding resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to isepamicin was observed for 91.1% of the 392, 87.7% of the 375, and 85.6% of the 111 isolates that were nonsusceptible to the carbapenems, all other aminoglycosides, and colistin, respectively. Isepamicin exhibited high in vitro activity against almost all of the Enterobacteriaceae species. It could particularly serve as a last-resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in our region, where it is endemic, as it does not show considerable cross-resistance with other aminoglycosides."

"We examined whether high doses of folic acid and iron supplementation in early-to-mid pregnancy affect the risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age neonates, in the mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece (Rhea study). We included 1,279 women with singleton pregnancies with complete data on supplements use in early-to-mid pregnancy and birth outcomes. Anthropometric measurements at birth were obtained from medical records. Red blood cell folate concentrations in cord blood were measured in a subsample of the study population (n = 58). Sixty-six percent of the study participants reported high doses of supplemental folic acid use (5 mg/day), while 21 % reported excessive doses of folic acid use (&gt;5 mg/day) in early-to-mid pregnancy. Daily intake of 5-mg supplemental folic acid was associated with a 31 % decrease in the risk of preterm birth (RR, 0.69; 95 % CI, 0.44, 0.99), 60 % decrease in the risk of delivering a low birth weight neonate (RR, 0.40; 95 % CI, 0.21, 0.76), and 66 % decrease in the risk of delivering a small for gestational age (SGA) neonate (RR, 0.34; 95 % CI, 0.16, 0.73). Daily doses of iron supplementation more than 100 mg were associated with a twofold increased risk for SGA neonates (RR, 2.14; 95 % CI, 0.99, 5.97). These findings suggest that high daily doses of supplementary folic acid in early-to-mid pregnancy may be protective for preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age neonates, while high daily doses of supplementary iron may be harmful for fetal growth."

Hybridisation is considered an important evolutionary phenomenon in Gnaphalieae, but contemporary hybridisation has been little explored within the tribe. Here, hybridisation between Helichrysum orientale and Helichrysum stoechas is studied at two different localities in the islands of Crete and Rhodes (Greece). Using three different types of molecular data (AFLP, nrDNA ITS sequences and cpDNA ndhF sequences) and morphological data, the aim is to provide simultaneous and direct comparisons between molecular and morphological variation among the parental species and the studied hybrid populations. AFLP profiles, ITS sequences and morphological data support the existence of hybrids at the two localities studied, shown as morphological and genetic intermediates between the parental species. Chloroplast DNA sequences show that both parental species can act either as pollen donor or as maternal parent. Fertility of hybrids is demonstrated by the viability of seeds produced by hybrids from both localities, and the detection of a backcross specimen to H. orientale. Although there is general congruence of morphological and molecular data, the analysis of morphology and ITS sequences can fail to detect backcross hybrids.

"AIM: Our aims were to assess the phylogeographic patterns of genetic diversity in eastern Mediterranean water frogs and to estimate divergence times using different geological scenarios. We related divergence times to past geological events and discuss the relevance of our data for the systematics of eastern Mediterranean water frogs.  LOCATION: The eastern Mediterranean region.  METHODS: Genetic diversity and divergence were calculated using sequences of two protein-coding mitochondrial (mt) genes: ND2 (1038 bp, 119 sequences) and ND3 (340 bp, 612 sequences). Divergence times were estimated in a Bayesian framework under four geological scenarios representing alternative possible geological histories for the eastern Mediterranean. We then compared the different scenarios using Bayes factors and additional geological data.  RESULTS: Extensive genetic diversity in mtDNA divides eastern Mediterranean water frogs into six main haplogroups (MHG). Three MHGs were identified on the Anatolian mainland; the most widespread MHG with the highest diversity is distributed from western Anatolia to the northern shore of the Caspian Sea, including the type locality of Pelophylax ridibundus. The other two Anatolian MHGs are restricted to south-eastern Turkey, occupying localities west and east of the Amanos mountain range. One of the remaining three MHGs is restricted to Cyprus; a second to the Levant; the third was found in the distribution area of European lake frogs (P. ridibundus group), including the Balkans.  MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Based on geological evidence and estimates of genetic divergence we hypothesize that the water frogs of Cyprus have been isolated from the Anatolian mainland populations since the end of the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC), i.e. since c. 5.5-5.3 Ma, while our divergence time estimates indicate that the isolation of Crete from the mainland populations (Peloponnese, Anatolia) most likely pre-dates the MSC. The observed rates of divergence imply a time window of c. 1.6-1.1 million years for diversification of the largest Anatolian MHG; divergence between the two other Anatolian MHGs may have begun about 3.0 Ma, apparently as a result of uplift of the Amanos Mountains. Our mtDNA data suggest that the Anatolian water frogs and frogs from Cyprus represent several undescribed species."

"To define the needs of intensive care unit patients' families in the specific suburban/rural population of Crete Island. Families of intensive care unit patients have specific needs that should also be addressed by the intensive care unit-care team. Current research has mostly concentrated on families from an urban setting, therefore may not be applicable to other populations. Prospective cohort study. Family members of patients admitted in the intensive care unit for ≥ 48 hours over 18 months, in a mixed medical-surgical, 11 bed closed intensive care unit. Questionnaire: The Greek translation of Critical Care Family Need Inventory, which consists of 45 need items covering the information, reassurance, proximity, support and comfort domains. Each item was scored on a four-point scale (1 = very important to 4 = not important). Participants were also asked to single out the most important need from the Critical Care Family Need Inventory and complete a questionnaire on basic demographic characteristics. Two hundred and thirty (65%) family members completed the questionnaire. Mean score for each of the 45 items ranged from 1.03-3 (scale from 1: very important-4: not important). Fourteen items were rated by responders as very important (mean score &lt;1.25). Reassurance need items were consistently singled out as most important regardless of the participant's background. Participants with a lower educational and socio-economical status rated support need items as more important than those with a higher status. In this particular suburban/rural population, both 'universal' reassurance needs and specific support needs related to responders' educational or socio-economical background were identified. Enhanced recognition of these needs may improve quality of care offered by intensive care unit-care team to families of their patients."

"Rapid signaling of estrogen involves membrane estrogen receptors (ERs), including membrane subpopulations of ERα and ERβ. In the mid-1990s, several laboratories independently reported the cloning of an orphan G protein-coupled receptor from vascular and cancer cells that was named GPR30. Research published between 2000 and 2005 provided evidence that GPR30 binds and signals via estrogen indicating that this intracellular receptor is involved in rapid, non-genomic estrogen signaling. The receptor has since been designated as the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) by the International Union of Pharmacology. The availability of genetic tools such as different lines of GPER knock-out mice, as well as GPER-selective agonists and antagonists has advanced our understanding, but also added some confusion about the new function of this receptor. GPER not only binds estrogens but also other substances, including SERMs, SERDs, and environmental ER activators (endocrine disruptors; xenoestrogens) and also interacts with other proteins. This article represents a summary of a lecture given at the 7(th) International Meeting on Rapid Responses to Steroid Hormones in September 2011 in Axos, Crete, and reviews the current knowledge and questions about GPER-dependent signaling and function. Controversies that have complicated our understanding of GPER, including interactions with human ERα-36 and aldosterone as a potential ligand, will also be discussed."

Early diagnosis of anaemia represents an important task within primary care settings. This study reports on the frequency of new cases of anaemia among patients attending rural primary care settings in Crete (Greece) and to offer an estimate of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) frequency in this study group. All patients attending the rural primary health care units of twelve general practitioners (GPs) on the island of Crete for ten consecutive working days were eligible to participate in this study. Hemoglobin (Hb) levels were measured by portable analyzers. Laboratory tests to confirm new cases of anaemia were performed at the University General Hospital of Heraklion. One hundred and thirteen out of 541 recruited patients had a low value of Hb according to the initial measurement obtained by the use of the portable analyzer. Forty five (45.5%) of the 99 subjects who underwent laboratory testing had confirmed anaemia. The mean value of the Hb levels in the group with confirmed anaemia, as detected by the portable analyzer was 11.1 g/dl (95% Confidence Interval (CI) from 10.9 to 11.4) and the respective mean value of the Hb levels obtained from the full blood count was 11.4 g/dl (95% CI from 11.2 to 11.7) (P = 0.01). Sixteen out of those 45 patients with anaemia (35.6%) had IDA, with ferritin levels lower than 30 ng/ml. Keeping in mind that this paper does not deal with specificity or sensitivity figures, it is suggested that in rural and remote settings anaemia is still invisible and point of care testing may have a place to identify it.

The exploratory cluster analysis identified 9 clinicoplacental (macerated stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, placenta creta, acute fetal distress, uterine hypoxia, severe ascending infection, placental abruption, and mixed etiology [2 clusters]), 5 purely placental (regressive placental changes, excessive extravillous trophoblasts, placental hydrops, fetal thrombotic vasculopathy, stem obliterative endarteritis), and 1 purely clinical (fetal congenital malformations) statistically significant clusters/subclusters. The clusters of such variables like clinical umbilical cord compromise, preuterine and postuterine hypoxia, gross umbilical cord or gross chorionic disk abnormalities did not reveal statistically significant stability. Although clinical usefulness of several well-established placental lesions has been confirmed, claims about high predictability of others have not.

Five hundred and eighty pregnant women participating in ""Rhea"" cohort study completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R) at 28-32 weeks of gestation. Information on anthropometric measures at birth was obtained from the hospital delivery logs and medical records. Fetal growth restriction was based on a customized model, and multivariate logistic regression models were used adjusting for confounders. A per unit increase in the EPQ Neuroticism scale increased the risk for fetal weight growth restriction by 9% [odds ratio (OR)=1.09, 95 percent CI: 1.01, 1.19)], and for fetal head circumference growth restriction by 6% [OR=1.06, 95 percent CI: 1.01, 1.18] after adjusting for maternal age, education, origin, marital status, working status, pre-pregnancy BMI, delivery type, parity, smoking, and alcohol intake during pregnancy. Maternal neuroticism, which predisposes to negative mood, may be a risk factor for fetal growth restriction."

"Some studies have shown that access to mental health services can have an impact on mental health outcomes, including the suicide rates. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between regional and prefecture suicide rates (suicides per 100.000 residents) and both the number of primary and mental health-care service providers and the number of mental health infrastructures in Greece. Data were taken mainly from the Hellenic Statistical Authority (EL.STAT.) and the Ministry of Health for the period 2002-2009. Spearman correlations were used to examine the relationship between primary health-care, mental health providers and suicide rates per 100,000 residents at the prefecture, administrative region and geographical region levels. Men showed significantly higher suicide rates than women (U=-7.20, p&lt;0.001). For the period 2002-2009, the highest suicide rate at the prefecture level were in Rethymno (6.99), Rodopi (5.62) and Zakynthos (5.28). For the same period, the highest suicide rates at the geographical level were in Peloponnisos (4.01), Ionian Islands (4.03) and Grete (3.65). Increase in suicide rates (2009 vs 2002-2009) was observed in the following geographical regions of Greece: Crete (4.76 vs 3.65), Thrace (4.45 vs 2.02) Central Greece (3.61 vs 1.39) Aegean Islands (3.03 vs 1.28). The highest correlations between suiciderutes and health services at the geographic regional level were found to be during the period 2007-2009, where suicide rates showed a significant negative correlation with privately practicing psychiatrists (rho=-0.71, p&lt;0.05), privately practicing psychologists (rho=-0.56, p&lt;0.05), pathologists (rho=-0.73, p&lt;0.01), and the number of the official mental health services (psychiatric clinics, day centers, mobile mental health units etc.) (rho=-0.73, p&lt;0.01). In conclusion it was found that at all regional levels, suicide rates were reversely related to the number of primary health-care and mental health service providers, as well as the number of mental health infrastructures in Greece. It should be noted that the running financial crisis in Greece seems to have many effects on quality of life, since the most common effects of an economic crisis are unemployment, spending power cuts,general insecurity and public spending retrenchment, including health related budget cuts. Having in mind the above situation, further analyses are needed to determine the relationship between mental health-care services, suicide rates and other psychosocial indices, in order to provide a strategic plan for a better design of mental health-care policy in Greece."

The pectinolytic species Pseudomonas viridiflava has a wide host range among plants, causing foliar and stem necrotic lesions and basal stem and root rots. However, little is known about the molecular evolution of this species. In this study we investigated the intraspecies genetic variation of P. viridiflava amongst local (Cretan), as well as international isolates of the pathogen. The genetic and phenotypic variability were investigated by molecular fingerprinting (rep-PCR) and partial sequencing of three housekeeping genes (gyrB, rpoD and rpoB), and by biochemical and pathogenicity profiling. The biochemical tests and pathogenicity profiling did not reveal any variability among the isolates studied. However, the molecular fingerprinting patterns and housekeeping gene sequences clearly differentiated them. In a broader phylogenetic comparison of housekeeping gene sequences deposited in GenBank, significant genetic variability at the molecular level was found between isolates of P. viridiflava originated from different host species as well as among isolates from the same host. Our results provide a basis for more comprehensive understanding of the biology, sources and shifts in genetic diversity and evolution of P. viridiflava populations and should support the development of molecular identification tools and epidemiological studies in diseases caused by this species.

"The incidence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases is lower in Mediterranean Southern Europe than Northern Europe. This may be due to a lower level of oxidative stress and a higher antioxidant status in people living around the Mediterranean Sea. Oxidative stress may influence the rate of shortening of telomeres, the nucleoprotein structures at the ends of chromosomes. We compared leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in elderly men from Northern and Southern Europe and investigated the possible relationship between LTL and indicators of oxidative stress and antioxidant status. We examined 143 elderly Dutch men (mean age 83.9 years) and 109 Greek elderly men (mean age 84.6 years) and found that the Greek men had significantly longer telomeres (geometric mean 4.95 kbp, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.71-5.23 kbp) compared to the men from the Netherlands (4.76 kbp, 95% CI: 4.55-4.98 kbp; P=0.001). Age was inversely associated with LTL (β=-0.10, P=0.31 in Cretan men and β=-0.19, P=0.02 in Dutch men). In all men LTL was not related to indicators of oxidative stress and plasma antioxidants. However, the endogenous antioxidants serum albumin (β=0.18, P=0.007) and uric acid (β=0.13, P=0.045) were positively associated with LTL. The age-adjusted difference between Crete and Zutphen was reduced by 25% after adjustment for serum albumin and uric acid. We conclude that Greek elderly men have significantly longer LTL compared to Dutch counterparts. The endogenous antioxidants albumin and uric acid were positively associated with longer telomeres."

"The insular dwarfism seen in Pleistocene elephants has come to epitomize the island rule; yet our understanding of this phenomenon is hampered by poor taxonomy. For Mediterranean dwarf elephants, where the most extreme cases of insular dwarfism are observed, a key systematic question remains unresolved: are all taxa phyletic dwarfs of a single mainland species Palaeoloxodon antiquus (straight-tusked elephant), or are some referable to Mammuthus (mammoths)? Ancient DNA and geochronological evidence have been used to support a Mammuthus origin for the Cretan 'Palaeoloxodon' creticus, but these studies have been shown to be flawed. On the basis of existing collections and recent field discoveries, we present new, morphological evidence for the taxonomic status of 'P'. creticus, and show that it is indeed a mammoth, most probably derived from Early Pleistocene Mammuthus meridionalis or possibly Late Pliocene Mammuthus rumanus. We also show that Mammuthus creticus is smaller than other known insular dwarf mammoths, and is similar in size to the smallest dwarf Palaeoloxodon species from Sicily and Malta, making it the smallest mammoth species known to have existed. These findings indicate that extreme insular dwarfism has evolved to a similar degree independently in two elephant lineages. "

"To design and perform a case-control study of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Crete, an island of 0.6 million people, that has experienced profound socioeconomic changes in recent decades. All MS cases occurring on Crete from 1980 to 2008 were ascertained. To search for putative risk factors, a structured questionnaire of 71 variables was employed, with patients with MS (n = 657) being compared to random controls (n = 593) matched for age, gender, and current place of residence. MS incidence rose markedly on Crete over the past 3 decades. This increase was associated with a major shift in MS distribution among genders (1980: F/M = 0.9; 2008: F/M = 2.1), with females living in towns or having relocated at a young age from the countryside to urban centers being mainly affected. In rural Crete, MS showed lesser increases and gender preference. Of the major changes that accompanied urbanization, smoking among women with MS increased dramatically, while imported pasteurized cow milk virtually replaced fresh goat milk produced locally. Compared to controls, female patients with MS more often used contraceptives and were older at first childbirth. Besides smoking, alcohol drinking and vitamin intake was more common among female patients with MS. Also, the distribution of childhood diseases and chronic medical conditions differed significantly between patients with MS and controls. MS incidence rose markedly over 3 decades in a genetically stable population in tandem with a transition from rural to urban living, thus possibly implicating environmental factors introduced by urbanization."

Farther south, underneath the Bitlis Suture, however, there are significant Pn delays with E-W anisotropy axes indicating significant lateral escape. Meanwhile, the GPS reveals very little surface deformation. This mismatch possibly suggests a decoupling along the suture. In the Aegean, the shear wave anisotropy and the Pn anisotropy directions agree with the extensional component of the right-lateral shear strains except under the Crete Basin and other parts of the southern Aegean Sea. This extensional direction matches perfectly also with the southward pulling force vectors across the Hellenic trench; however, the maximum right-lateral shear directions obtained from the GPS data in the Aegean do not match either of these anisotropies. Seismic anisotropy from Rayleigh waves sampled at 15 s, corresponding to the lower crust, match the maximum right-lateral maximum shear directions from the GPS indicating decoupling between the crust and the mantle. This decoupling most likely results from the lateral variations of the gravitational potential energies and the slab-pull forces."

"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an organ specific autoimmune disease of still unidentified genetic etiology. We have shown that endothelins (ETs), produced by the liver endothelial cells are increased in PBC and may play a major pathogenetic role. To study gene polymorphisms related to the endothelial cells (eNOS, EDN-1 genes) and, to investigate whether the previously reported association of CTLA4 gene polymorphisms is replicated in a genetically homogeneous Greek population. Genomic DNA was extracted from 100 PBC patients (83 females, 93% AMA+, 74/100 Ludwig stage I-II) and 158 healthy controls. eNOS, CTLA4 and ET1 polymorphisms were determined by PCR-RFLPs analysis. Both eNOS intron4 VNTR and eNOS exon7 G894T SNP were significantly associated with increased risk in PBC. EDN-11 rs2071942 ""A"" and rs5370 ""T"" alleles appeared a tendency for association with disease progression. No association was found between PBC and the CTLA4 SNPs analyzed. We demonstrated that eNOS, a gene related to the liver endothelium function is associated with PBC. Contrarily, the important in adaptive immunity gene CTLA4 was not associated with the disease in the homogeneous population analyzed. These results are compatible partially with our previous hypothesis that defects of the liver endothelial system, leading to endothelin overproduction, may be a fundamental early pathogenetic mechanism in PBC."

"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is acquiring increasing importance as a nosocomial pathogen. We retrospectively studied the characteristics and outcome of patients with any type of S. maltophilia infection at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, between 1/2005-12/2010. S. maltophilia antimicrobial susceptibility was tested with the agar dilution method. Prognostic factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality were assessed with multivariate logistic regression. Sixty-eight patients (median age: 70.5 years; 64.7% males) with S. maltophilia infection, not related to cystic fibrosis, were included. The 68 patients were hospitalized in medical (29.4%), surgical (26.5%), hematology/oncology departments (23.5%), or the intensive care units (ICU; 20.6%). The most frequent infection types were respiratory tract (54.4%), bloodstream (16.2%), skin/soft tissue (10.3%), and intra-abdominal (8.8%) infection. The S. maltophilia-associated infection was polymicrobial in 33.8% of the cases. In vitro susceptibility was higher to colistin (91.2%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and netilmicin (85.3% each), and ciprofloxacin (82.4%). The empirical and the targeted treatment regimens were microbiologically appropriate for 47.3% and 63.6% of the 55 patients with data available, respectively. Most patients received targeted therapy with a combination of agents other than trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The crude mortality and the mortality and the S. maltophilia infection-related mortality were 14.7% and 4.4%, respectively. ICU hospitalization was the only independent prognostic factor for mortality. S. maltophilia infection in a general hospital can be associated with a good prognosis, except for the patients hospitalized in the ICU. Combination reigmens with fluoroquinolones, colistin, or tigecycline could be alternative treatment options to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole."

Although benefits of breastfeeding have been widely promoted and accepted, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life is far from the norm in many countries. In a prospective mother-child cohort study in Crete, Greece ('Rhea' study), we assessed the frequency of breastfeeding and its socio-demographic predictors. Information on breastfeeding was available for a period of 18 months post-partum for a cohort of 1181 mothers and their 1208 infants. The frequency of exclusive and predominant breastfeeding in the first month post-partum was 17.8% and 3.4%, respectively, with almost three-quarters of women (73.6%) ceasing any breastfeeding after 4 months post-partum. Women were less likely to initiate breastfeeding if they had a caesarean delivery (CD), whereas they were more likely to initiate breastfeeding if they had a higher education or gave birth to a private clinic. Among women breastfeeding, those who had a CD, were ex-smokers or smokers during pregnancy had a statistically significant shorter duration of breastfeeding, whereas higher education and being on leave from work were associated with a longer duration of breastfeeding. Study findings suggest suboptimal levels of exclusive and any breastfeeding and difficulty maintaining longer breastfeeding duration. CD and smoking are common in Greece and are strong negative predictors for breastfeeding initiation and/or duration, necessitating targeting women at risk early in the prenatal period so as to have a meaningful increase of breastfeeding practices in future cohorts of mothers.

Taxonomy and phylogeny of termites of the genus Reticulitermes in central and eastern Mediterranean lands are poorly understood, partly due to insufficient sampling. This study aims to contribute to the knowledge of east Mediterranean termites by presenting morphological and molecular data on Reticulitermes from Cyprus. Samples from 15 colonies were collected throughout the island. Qualitative and quantitative morphological characters were analyzed for alate and soldier castes. Partial sequences of the mitochondrial genes COII and 16S were used to evaluate genetic diversity of Cypriot colonies and to determine their phylogenetic relationships with taxa from central and eastern Mediterranean areas. Cypriot alates have some morphological features in common with the Israeli R. clypeatus: an enlarged postclypeus and a wide unpigmented margin of the eye. They are larger than R. clypeatus but smaller than western European species, such as R. banyulensis, R. lucifugus corsicus and R. grassei. For Cypriot soldiers, two size groups were identified, possibly in relation with the age of their mother colonies. Phylogenetic analysis shows that, contrary to what might be expected, the samples with the highest affinity with Cypriot samples are not those from the nearby mainland (south Turkey, Israel), but from north-eastern Greece. Comprehensive sampling in the nearby mainland is lacking, so the possibility that populations exist it that region with an affinity towards Cypriot Reticulitermes sp. cannot be ruled out. Together with samples from the Halkidiki peninsula, north-eastern Greece, northern Turkey and Crete, Cypriot Reticulitermes form a well-supported north-eastern Mediterranean clade.

The present work was undertaken in order to study the epidemiology of dermatophytoses in the island of Crete, Greece, over a 7-year period (2004-2010) and to compare the results with those reported earlier from this region and from other parts of the world. A total of 3236 clinical specimens obtained from 2674 patients with signs of dermatomycoses were examined by direct micropscopy and culture. Overall, 392 specimens (12.1%) were proved mycologically positive for dermatophytes. The age of the patients ranged from 2 to 90 years (mean age, 41 years). Onychomycosis was the predominant clinical type of infection, followed by tinea pedis, tinea corporis, tinea capitis, tinea faciei, tinea manuum and tinea cruris. Among dermatophytes, nine species were isolated: Trichophyton rubrum (51%), Microsporum canis (18.9%), Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. interdigitale (18.4%), Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes (5.1%), Epidermophyton floccosum (3.6%), Microsporum gypseum (1.5%), Trichophyton violaceum (0.8%), Trichophyton verrucosum (0.5%) and Trichophyton tonsurans (0.2%). In our area, the most common dermatophyte was T. rubrum followed by M. canis. Epidemiological studies regarding the current prevalence of dermatophytes in a certain region are needed for the appropriate management of these infections and implementation of effective prevention and control measures.

We characterize divergence times, intraspecific diversity and distributions for recently recognized lineages within the Hyla arborea species group, based on mitochondrial and nuclear sequences from 160 localities spanning its whole distribution. Lineages of H. arborea, H. orientalis, H. molleri have at least Pliocene age, supporting species level divergence. The genetically uniform Iberian H. molleri, although largely isolated by the Pyrenees, is parapatric to H. arborea, with evidence for successful hybridization in a small Aquitanian corridor (southwestern France), where the distribution also overlaps with H. meridionalis. The genetically uniform H. arborea, spread from Crete to Brittany, exhibits molecular signatures of a postglacial range expansion. It meets different mtDNA clades of H. orientalis in NE-Greece, along the Carpathians, and in Poland along the Vistula River (there including hybridization). The East-European H. orientalis is strongly structured genetically. Five geographic mitochondrial clades are recognized, with a molecular signature of postglacial range expansions for the clade that reached the most northern latitudes. Hybridization with H. savignyi is suggested in southwestern Turkey. Thus, cryptic diversity in these Pliocene Hyla lineages covers three extremes: a genetically poor, quasi-Iberian endemic (H. molleri), a more uniform species distributed from the Balkans to Western Europe (H. arborea), and a well-structured Asia Minor-Eastern European species (H. orientalis).

"The relevance of preconceptional and prenatal toxicant exposures for genomic stability in offspring is difficult to analyze in human populations, because gestational exposures usually cannot be separated from preconceptional exposures. To analyze the roles of exposures during gestation and conception on genomic stability in the offspring, stability was assessed via the Comet assay and highly sensitive, semiautomated confocal laser scans of γH2AX foci in cord, maternal, and paternal blood as well as spermatozoa from 39 families in Crete, Greece, and the United Kingdom. With use of multivariate linear regression analysis with backward selection, preconceptional paternal smoking (% tail DNA: P&gt;0.032; γH2AX foci: P&gt;0.018) and gestational maternal (% tail DNA: P&gt;0.033) smoking were found to statistically significantly predict DNA damage in the cord blood of F1 offspring. Maternal passive smoke exposure was not identified as a predictor of DNA damage in cord blood, indicating that the effect of paternal smoking may be transmitted via the spermatozoal genome. Taken together, these studies reveal a role for cigarette smoke in the induction of DNA alterations in human F1 offspring via exposures of the fetus in utero or the paternal germline. Moreover, the identification of transgenerational DNA alterations in the unexposed F1 offspring of smoking-exposed fathers supports the claim that cigarette smoke is a human germ cell mutagen."

Despite the known increase in substance use and risky sexual behaviors among young people during holiday periods, issues of sexual harassment (SH) and having sex against one's will (SAW) have not received adequate attention. We implemented a cross-sectional airport-based study to identify experience of SH and SAW in 6,502 British and German holidaymakers aged 16-35 years visiting tourist resorts in Southern Europe (Crete, Cyprus, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) in summer 2009. Across all participants, 8.6 % reported SH during their holiday and 1.5 % reported SAW. Women reported higher levels of SH than heterosexual males. However, gay and bisexual males reported SH levels similar to females and the highest levels of SAW. Of 19 predictor variables tested, ten were independently associated with SH. SH was increased in those who were visitors to Mallorca or Crete, British, younger, female, gay or bisexual, frequently drunk on holiday, cocaine users, and attracted to bars where people get drunk, or where there are opportunities for sex. Among 13 predictor variables tested for SAW, four were significant. SAW reduced in those visiting Cyprus, and was strongly associated with being a gay or bisexual male, using cannabis on holiday and being attracted to bars where there were opportunities for sex. Holiday resorts represent a key location for SH and SAW, especially for holidaymakers who get drunk and use drugs. Preventive programs can raise awareness of the risks of unwanted sexual encounters on holiday and work with the tourist industry and tourist authorities to develop environments where sexual aggression is not tolerated.

The alarmingly increasing resistance rates among non-fermenting Gram-negative species, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, intensified the interest in alternative antibiotic treatment options. Isepamicin, an old aminoglycoside, may play a role in the treatment of patients with infections caused by those multi-drug resistant pathogens. We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of isepamicin against non-fermenting Gram-negative isolates collected of the microbiological laboratory at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece from 2004 to the first trimester of 2011. We tested a total of 4,219 isolates (66.2 % Pseudomonas spp., 30 % Acinetobacter spp., 3.8 % other non-fermenters). The lower respiratory tract, pus, and urine were the most frequent sites of isolation (29.7 %, 19.9 %, and 12.9 %, respectively). Overall, 2768 (65.6 %) of the evaluated isolates were susceptible to isepamicin (including 79.9 % of Pseudomonas spp, 37.2 % of Acinetobacter spp, 43.1 % of other non-fermenters). Isepamicin exhibited higher antimicrobial activity compared to broad spectrum penicillins, cephalosporins, other aminoglycosides, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. Only colistin was more active than isepamicin. Additionally, 41.7 % of carbapenem-resistant and 53.2 % of colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to isepamicin. The susceptibility rates for the respective types of A. baumannii isolates were 12 % and 6.2 %. Yet, isepamicin was active against 29.2 % of A. baumannii that were resistant to all other tested aminoglycosides. Isepamicin exhibits considerable antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative non-fermenters in a region with high antimicrobial resistance. Particularly, isepamicin may provide a therapeutic option for infections from carbapenem- and colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa and other aminoglycoside-resistant A. baumannii. Further modifications in the aminoglycoside molecule may provide formulations with enhanced antimicrobial activity.

"A description of four new species of Dolichopoda Bolivar, 1880 (Orthoptera, Rhaphidophoridae) from Eastern Aegean region (Southern Sporades), including Western Turkey, is reported. This brings to a total of 11 the number of Dolichopoda species recorded for caves of the Aegean area. Overall, these species show a high degree of morphological homogeneity and they are very close to Dolichopoda paraskevi Boudou-Saltet, 1973 from Crete and Dolichopoda naxia Boudou-Saltet, 1972 from Cyclades (Naxos Island). The Western Turkish species are morphologically not closely related to the other Anatolian species; this suggests an independent origin for the taxa occurring in the Southern Taurus and Black Sea regions. These new data help to better define the already high level of diversity of the Hellenic Dolichopoda and strengthen the hypothesis that the central area of dispersal for the genus would correspond to the ancient Aegean plate."

The case of Ierapetra, Crete Island, Greece. 	The occurrence of non-fatal acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is examined in relation with the local bioclimatic conditions in the Ierapetra area, in the southernmost part of Crete Island, Greece, during the period 2004-2007. Daily ACS counts and corresponding meteorological parameters, such as maximum and minimum air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and cloudiness, were analyzed. Besides, the daily values of the human thermal index, physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) was evaluated. Pearson's χ(2)  test and generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson distribution were applied. The ACS syndromes present a multiple variation within the year, with the primary maximum in August and the secondary in May, while relative high ACS frequencies exist in early winter time. The impact of the weather variability on the ACS incidence is not statistically significant (C.L. 95%).

The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution and changes in the antibiotic susceptibilities of uropathogens isolated from adults with community-acquired urinary tract infections (CA-UTIs) in Crete, Greece, over a 6-year period. This study was performed with isolates from outpatients with UTIs, collected between 2005 and 2010. Isolates were identified by standard methods and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method and the VITEK2 is an automated system used for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of microorganisms (BioMerieux). To identify changes in susceptibility patterns, we compared results of the period 2005-2007 to those of the period 2008-2010. We also compared the antibiotic susceptibilities of isolates between males and females. A total of 4011 community-acquired uropathogens were isolated during the period of 2005-2010. Escherichia coli was the most common organism and responsible for 68.9% of CA-UTIs, followed by Proteus mirabilis (6.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%) and enterococci (6%). A significant increase in resistance of E coli isolates was noted for β-lactams, monobactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones, and cotrimoxazole. The reverse trend was evident for nitrofurantoin. Higher resistance rates of community-acquired E coli and non-E coli Enterobacteriaceae were noted in males for ampicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and quinolones. No significant sex differences were noted in the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of enterococci. There is a concerning trend for increasing resistance among E coli and non-E coli Enterobacteriaceae responsible for CA-UTIs in Crete in recent years likely due to the inappropriate use of broad spectrum antibiotics, as a substitute for precise diagnostics and/or to increase the chances of therapeutic success.

To explore occupational and psychological risk factors for the incidence and persistence of multi-site musculoskeletal pain. We conducted a longitudinal investigation of three occupational groups in Crete, Greece. Baseline information was obtained at interview about pain in the past year at each of six anatomical sites, and about possible risk factors for subsequent symptoms. Twelve months later, subjects were re-interviewed about pain at the same anatomical sites in the past month. Pain at two or more sites was classed as multi-site. Associations with new development and persistence of multi-site pain at follow-up were assessed by logistic regression. Analysis was based on 518 subjects (87% of those originally selected for study). At follow-up, multi-site pain persisted in 217 (62%) of those who had experienced it in the year before baseline, and was newly developed in 27 (17%) of those who had not. Persistence of multi-site pain was significantly related to physical loading at work, somatising tendency and beliefs about work as a cause of musculoskeletal pain, with OR (95% CI) for the highest relative to the lowest exposure categories of 2.3 (1.0 to 5.6), 2.6 (1.5 to 4.6) and 1.9 (1.1 to 3.3) respectively. Development of new multi-site pain was most strongly associated with working for ≥40 h per week (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 24.0). Our findings confirm the importance of both physical loading at work and somatising tendency as risk factors for multi-site pain, and suggest that persistence of pain is also influenced by adverse beliefs about work causation.

"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a disease with genetic and environmental pathogenetic background. Chemicals, infectious agents, hormone therapy, reproductive history and surgical interventions have been implicated in the induction of PBC. Familial PBC has been documented in first degree relatives (FDR). Most cohort studies are genetically heterogeneous. Our study aimed to determine eventual lifestyle or disease associations and familial occurrence rates in a genetically homogeneous and geographically defined population of PBC patients. 111 consenting PBC patients, were compared with 115 FDR and 149 controls matched for age, sex, Cretan origin and residence. All participants completed a questionnaire regarding demographics, lifestyle, medical, surgical and reproductive history. Significant variables on the univariate analysis were analyzed by multivariate analysis using a forward step-wise logistic regression model. Dyslipidaemia was found in 69.4% of patients, 60% of FDR and 40.9% of controls (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.003 respectively), autoimmune diseases in 36.9% of patients, 30.4% of FDR and 13.4% of controls (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.011 respectively). Hashimoto's disease (p = 0.003), Raynaud syndrome (p = 0.023) and Sjögren syndrome (p = 0.044) were significantly associated with PBC. On multivariate analysis statistically significant associations were found with primary educational level (AOR 2.304, 95% CI 1.024-5.181), cholecystectomy (AOR 2.927, 95% CI 1.347-6.362) and the presence of at least another autoimmune disease (AOR 3.318, 95% CI 1.177-6.22). Cancer history was more frequent in patients than in controls (p = 0.033). Familial PBC was found to be 9.9%. Dyslipidaemia and autoimmune diseases were significantly increased not only in patients as expected but also in their FDR. An increased prevalence of malignancies was found in patients. Primary educational level, cholecystectomy and the presence of at least another autoimmune disease were found as putative risk factors for PBC. No association was found with smoking, urinary tract infection or reproductive history. The reported high familial occurrence of PBC could imply screening with AMA of FDR with at least another autoimmune disease."

Faecal contamination of soil and tomatoes irrigated by sprinkler as well as surface and subsurface drip irrigation with treated domestic wastewater were compared in 2007 and 2008 at experimental sites in Crete and Italy. Wastewater was treated by Membrane Bio Reactor (MBR) technology, gravel filtration or UV-treatment before used for irrigation. Irrigation water, soil and tomato samples were collected during two cropping seasons and enumerated for the faecal indicator bacterium Escherichia coli and helminth eggs. The study found elevated levels of E. coli in irrigation water (mean: Italy 1753 cell forming unit (cfu) per 100 ml and Crete 488 cfu per 100 ml) and low concentrations of E. coli in soil (mean: Italy 95 cfu g(-1) and Crete 33 cfu g(-1)). Only two out of 84 tomato samples in Crete contained E. coli (mean: 2700 cfu g(-1)) while tomatoes from Italy were free of E. coli. No helminth eggs were found in the irrigation water or on the tomatoes from Crete. Two tomato samples out of 36 from Italy were contaminated by helminth eggs (mean: 0.18 eggs g(-1)) and had been irrigated with treated wastewater and tap water, respectively. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis DNA fingerprints of E. coli collected during 2008 showed no identical pattern between water and soil isolates which indicates contribution from other environmental sources with E. coli, e.g. wildlife. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model with Monte Carlo simulations adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) found the use of tap water and treated wastewater to be associated with risks that exceed permissible limits as proposed by the WHO (1.0 × 10(-3) disease risk per person per year) for the accidental ingestion of irrigated soil by farmers (Crete: 0.67 pppy and Italy: 1.0 pppy). The QMRA found that the consumption of tomatoes in Italy was deemed to be safe while permissible limits were exceeded in Crete (1.0 pppy). Overall the quality of tomatoes was safe for human consumption since the disease risk found on Crete was based on only two contaminated tomato samples. It is a fundamental limitation of the WHO QMRA model that it is not based on actual pathogen numbers, but rather on numbers of E. coli converted to estimated pathogen numbers, since it is widely accepted that there is poor correlation between E. coli and viral and parasite pathogens. Our findings also stress the importance of the external environment, typically wildlife, as sources of faecal contamination.

Women self-completed two questionnaires: The Social Capital Questionnaire at about the 24th week of gestation and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (range 0-30) at about the 8-10th week postpartum. Maternal social capital scores were categorized into three groups: the upper 10% was the high social capital group, the middle 80% was the medium and the lowest 10% was the low social capital group that served as the reference category. Multivariable log-binomial and linear regression models were performed for: the whole available sample; for participants with a history of depression and/or prenatal EPDS≥13; for participants without any previous or current depression and prenatal EPDS score&lt;13. Potential confounders included demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle and pregnancy characteristics that have an established or potential association with maternal social capital in pregnancy or postpartum depressive symptoms or both. Higher maternal social capital was associated with lower EPDS scores (highest vs lowest group: β-coefficient=-3.95, 95% CI -7.75, -0.14). Similar effects were noted for the subscale value of life/social agency (highest vs lowest group: β-coefficient=-5.96, 95% CI -9.52, -2.37). This association remained significant for women with and without past and/or present depression only for the subscale value of life/social agency although with a more imprecise estimate. No effect was found for participation, a structural dimension of social capital. Women with higher individual-level social capital in mid-pregnancy reported less depressive symptoms 6-8 weeks postpartum. Given the proposed association of perceptions of the social environment with postpartum depressive symptoms, health professionals should consider evidence-based interventions to address depression in a social framework."

Two hundred twenty-one extra virgin olive oils (EVOO) were extracted from four olive mono-cultivars (Koroneiki, Tsounati, Adramitini, and Throubolia) originated from four divisions of Greece (Peloponnesus, Crete, Zakynthos, and Lesvos) and collected in five harvesting periods (2002-2006 and 2007-2008). All samples were chemically analysed by means of (1)H and (31)P NMR spectroscopy and characterised according to their content in fatty acids, phenolic compounds, diacylglycerols, total free sterols, free acidity, and iodine number. The influence of cultivars on the compositional data of the EVOO samples according to harvest year and geographical origin was examined by means of the forward stepwise canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) and classification binary trees (CBT). The CDA, when the a priori grouping was in accordance with harvest, was high (94%), whereas the classification in terms of groups formed by inclusions of geographical origin was reduced to 85%. Inclusion of both the harvesting year and geographical origin in the CDA analysis resulted in a high classification (90%) for the EVOO samples grouped into the four cultivars. The variables that most satisfactorily classified the Greek olive oils were the phenolics p-coumaric acid, pinoresinol, 1-acetoxypinoresinol, syringaresinol, luteolin, apigenin, and the hydrolysis products of oleuropein expressed collectively by the concentration of total hydroxytyrosol. Amongst the fatty acids, linoleic acid was the predictor with the highest discriminatory power. Finally, the phylogenetic significance of the olive oil compounds as determined by NMR was investigated by estimating their support to monophyly of cultivars.

"Tobacco and alcohol use during adolescence have potential long term health consequences and a possibility of future addiction. This cross sectional study took place in 2007 among a convenience sample of 981 adolescents from public elementary and high schools in Eastern Crete, Greece. Following parental consent, an anonymous structured questionnaire including information on personal and family use of alcohol and tobacco was distributed. Among the entire study population, cigarette experimentation was found to be associated with current alcohol use, with an Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) of 38.8; (95%C.I: 5.33-58.2) and with having a smoker in the immediate family (aOR 10.3; 95%C.I: 3.14-34.0). Among the subset of elementary school children, cigarette smoking was strongly associated with current alcohol use aOR 9.7; (95%C.I: 2.12-44.3), while the association between smoking experimentation and sibling and parental alcohol use was statistically significant within the entire population (however not among elementary students) with an aOR of 2.76 (95%C.I: 1.24-6.15) and aOR 3.66, (95%C.I: 1.97-6.81) respectively. The elementary child's gender was not found to be associated with cigarette experimentation among this study population. Strong associations were found between alcohol use and tobacco experimentation. The potential parental influence on consequent adolescent tobacco and alcohol use was also noted. Potential community based interventions, if launched in Greece, should take the role of the Greek family into account."

"In this era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, infections caused by multi-drug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacilli (GNB) are becoming more common and pose a challenge to all clinicians, including surgeons. We evaluated the epidemiology and antimicrobial sensitivities of GNB isolated from patients treated on surgical wards at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, from 2004 to 2009. The MDR isolates were defined according to an international expert proposal supported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. A total of 1,153 GNB were isolated; 536 (46.5%) were MDR. The most common isolates were Escherichia coli (312 [27.8%]; MDR rate 50.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (298 [25.8%]; MDR rate 39.6%), Acinetobacter baumannii (137 [11.9%]; MDR rate 83.9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (112 [9.7%]; MDR rate 44.6%). Most pathogens were isolated from patients hospitalized in the Departments of Surgical Oncology (32.3%), Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (31.8%), General Surgery (18.1%), and Pediatric Surgery (15.5%). The clinical specimens comprised pus (45.1%), normally sterile fluids (22.5%), urine (16.8%), blood (6.3%), and other body fluids. Most effective in vitro against all MDR pathogens were colistin (83%), meropenem (57%), and imipenem-cilastatin (56%). The MDR P. aeruginosa was susceptible most often to colistin (94%) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin 56%, amikacin 55%), MDR A. baumannii only to colistin (94%), and MDR K. pneumoniae to meropenem (92%) and aminoglycosides (amikacin 76%, gentamicin 74%). In a region with a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance, almost one-half of GNB isolated from surgical patients were MDR. Surgeons may consider these developments to guide empiric antibiotic therapy for infections caused by gram-negative pathogens."

"Maternal thyroid dysfunction, especially in early pregnancy, may lead to pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes. Few population-based prospective studies have evaluated these effects and results are discrepant. We examined the association of thyroid function and autoimmunity in early pregnancy with adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. The study used data from the prospective mother-child cohort ""Rhea"" study in Crete, Greece. A total of 1170 women with singleton pregnancies participated in this analysis. Maternal serum samples in the first trimester of pregnancy were tested for thyroid hormones (TSH, free T(4), and free T(3)) and thyroid antibodies (thyroid peroxidase antibody and thyroglobulin antibody). Multivariable log-Poisson regression models were used adjusting for confounders. Outcomes included gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, cesarean section, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and small-for-gestational-age neonates. The combination of high TSH and thyroid autoimmunity in early pregnancy was associated with a 4-fold increased risk for gestational diabetes [relative risk (RR) 4.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-8.9)] and a 3-fold increased risk for low birth weight neonates (RR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-8.0) after adjustment for several confounders. Women positive for thyroid antibodies without elevated TSH levels in early pregnancy were at high risk for spontaneous preterm delivery (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.8), whereas the combined effect of high TSH and positive thyroid antibodies did not show an association with preterm birth. High TSH levels and thyroid autoimmunity in early pregnancy may detrimentally affect pregnancy and birth outcomes."

The purpose of this study was to identify voice risk factors for female kindergarten teachers and nurses in Heraklion, Crete. A questionnaire consisting of voice use and lifestyle activities was given to 200 kindergarten teachers in Heraklion, Crete, of which 151 were returned (75.5%). A group of 89 nurses served as the control group. Both groups also completed the Greek version of the Voice Handicap Index (VHI-G). Kindergarten teachers sing more often, speak loudly more often when they are at work and present with more infections of the upper respiratory tract compared to nurses. They talk less than 30 min per day on the phone, drink less alcohol and water and smoke less in comparison with nurses. The median VHI-G score for the kindergarten teachers was significantly higher than that for the nurses. The results suggest that there is a difference in the factors that may be responsible for the appearance of voice problems in kindergarten teachers and in nurses. For kindergarten teachers, the risk factors for voice disorders are primarily related to vocal load factors and for nurses appear to be lifestyle-related more than voice use alone.

"Placenta creta is an increasingly prevalent cause of maternal morbidity/mortality. Decidua is at least focally defective and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) may be abnormal. The study aims to compare differences in migratory trophoblast and spiral artery remodeling between areas with and without decidua at the placental implantation site. Sixteen (12 creta, 4 non-creta) caesarean hysterectomy specimens were studied immunohistochemically. Invasive EVT and multinucleate trophoblast giant cells (MTGC) were quantified; confluent EVT (&gt;5 opposed EVTs) and spiral artery remodeling were assessed semi-quantitatively. In 6 cases, placenta creta was focal. Compared to placenta creta with local decidua, cases without local decidua had increased interstitial EVT cells (×200 field) (SEM 45.6 [4.9] vs. 80.5 [3.9], p &lt; 0.0001), fewer multinucleate trophoblast giant cells (expressed as a percentage of total EVT) (0.8 [0.3] vs. 31.5 [2.2]% p &lt; 0.0001) and EVT was more confluent (p &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, placenta creta cases with local decidua had a greater degree of spiral artery remodeling (mean remodeling score 1.65 [0.07] vs. 1.13 [0.05], p &lt; 0.0001) associated with increased intramural trophoblast (p = 0.0008). The only difference between placenta creta with local decidua and normal placentation cases was an increased number of interstitial EVT cells in creta cases (45.6 [4.9] vs. 24.8 [3.2], p = 0.04). Numbers of interstitial EVT are increased in placenta creta, more so in cases without local decidua. Despite this spiral artery modeling is reduced in placenta creta cases with no decidua. The results emphasize the crucial role of decidua in control of trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling."

"To investigate the presence of atherogenic factors among preschool children of Crete, Greece. This was a cross-sectional study. The study population included 1189 children, aged four to seven years, examined from January to May 2005, in public kindergartens. Biochemical, anthropometric, and blood pressure measurements were performed. Of the boys 27.4% were classified as overweight or obese (obese 10.8%). The respective percentage for girls was 28.5% (obese 9%); 7.4% percent of the boys and 7.9% of the girls had blood pressure above the ninety-fifth percentile. TC of &gt; 200 mg / dl was found in 14.4% and LDL-C of &gt; 130 mg / dl in 13.8% of the children. Children with serum TG of &gt; 100 mg / dl had a significantly higher mean WC and BMI than those with triglyceride levels of ≤ 80 mg / dl (59.7 vs. 55.9 cm and 17.9 vs. 16.6 kg / m(2); P &lt; 0.05). Similarly, children with HDL-C &lt; 45 mg / dl had significantly higher WC and BMI than children with HDL-C ≥ 60 mg / dl (57.7 vs. 53.5 cm and 17.1 vs. 16.5 kg / m(2); P &lt; 0.05). Obese children had an Odds Ratio of 2.87 (95% confidence interval, 1.05 - 7.85, P = 0.041) for hypertriglyceridemia, as compared to non-obese children. Levels of obesity and especially central obesity were strongly related to other atherogenic risk factors in Cretan preschool children indicating the presence of this major public health problem in early ages."

"Greece is striving to limit its health expenditure to essential needs. General practice and the provision of Primary Health Care (PHC) mainly take place in rural settings, where approximately 200 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCCs) have been established. In order to determine how to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of PHC services, it is important to first gain insights into the providers' perspectives. The aim of the study was to assess the perceptions of General Practitioners (GPs) and the directors of PHCCs regarding the effectiveness of available PHC services, and to elicit suggestions on how current services could be improved. This qualitative study was based on semi-structured interviews. The setting was 21 PHCCs in the Epirus and Crete regions of Greece. Twenty-nine physicians were interviewed on aspects of capacity, resources, performance and quality of PHC services. Discussions were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcriptions were then analysed using thematic content analysis. The main identified barriers to providing high-quality PHC services were: PHC service shortages in workforce and equipment; inadequate GP and paramedic training; the absence of position/job descriptions or duty statements for GPs and other PHC personnel; and limited public awareness about the role of GPs. Suggestions for remodelling the current PHC system included: the introduction of new technologies; GP empowerment; leadership reforms; and mechanisms for evaluating of the quality of services. Finally, areas of concern regarding future development and utilisation of private PHC infrastructure and services were highlighted. The methodology of this study and the results regarding remodelling the current PHC system could be used to inform policy-making in Greece, particularly in the current period of severe economic crisis; they may also be of relevance to other European countries facing similar challenges in allocating resources and reforming PHC."

VEGFR2 gene polymorphisms have already been correlated with vascular diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) and may influence endothelial integrity, repair and function. In view of the premature atherosclerosis observed in SLE, we sought to clarify the structural/functional consequences of two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VEGFR2 in SLE and determine whether they are associated with risk of SLE by influencing endothelial cells. Three-dimensional (3D) homology modelling was applied for the localisation of the V297I and the Q472H polymorphisms. Genotyping of the V297I (rs2305948) and Q472H (rs1870377) SNPs was done through Taqman technology in 250 SLE patients and 241 healthy controls from a Greek population (Cretan). The replication sample set for the rs1870377 SNP consisted of 253, 184 and 77 patients with SLE and 301, 118 and 11 ethnically-matched controls of African-American, European-American and Hispanic-American origin, respectively. Modelling revealed that the V297I polymorphism may affect the efficiency of trans-autophosphorylation and cell signalling, while Q472H affects homotypic contacts of membrane proximal Ig-like domains. No significant allelic and genotypic association was observed for both the SNPs with risk of SLE. Although structural data suggest that both VEGFR2 SNPs may contribute to SLE pathogenesis by impairing VEGF signalling, none of the SNPs analysed was associated with increased susceptibility to SLE. However, they still may be relevant to the vascular damage/atherosclerosis in SLE.

"Stress is defined as a state of real or perceived threat to homeostasis. The principal effectors of the stress system are corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), arginine                      vasopressin, the proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and β-endorphin, the glucocorticoids, and the catecholamines                      norepinephrine and epinephrine. Appropriate responsiveness of the stress system to stressors is a crucial prerequisite for a sense of well-being, adequate performance of tasks, and                      positive social interactions. By contrast, inappropriate responsiveness of the stress system may impair growth and development and may account for various endocrine, metabolic,                      autoimmune, and psychiatric disorders. The development and severity of these conditions primarily depend on the genetic vulnerability of the individual, the exposure to adverse                      environmental factors, and the timing of stressful event(s). Prenatal life, infancy, childhood, and adolescence are critical periods characterized by increased vulnerability to                      stressors. This review summarizes the topics presented at the fifth New Inroads to Child Health (NICHe) Conference ""Stress Response and Child Health"" held at                      Heraklion, Crete, Greece, in May 2012."

This study examined the phonetic realization of voiced stops in the Cretan and Thessalonikan dialects of Modern Greek. Six males and six females of each dialect were recorded in a sentence-reading task. Duration and amplitude were measured to compare the degree of nasality of voiced stops to that of nasals in different phonetic contexts. Results showed that amplitude changes during the voicing bar of the voiced stops varied both within and across speakers. In some instances, there was consistently low amplitude throughout the voicing bar (characteristic of voiced stops), whereas in other instances, there was high amplitude at the closure onset followed by decreasing amplitude toward the burst (characteristic of prenasalization). By contrast, nasals had consistently high amplitude throughout the murmur. The mixed-effects models suggest that there were complex and interactive influences of dialect, gender, prosodic position, and stress in realizing prenasality in the voiced stops. In particular, Cretan male speakers showed the least clear tendency of prenasalization consistent with earlier impressionistic studies. Furthermore, productions of Cretan males showed less prenasalization than those of females in both prosodic positions. The procedures in this study can be used to describe prenasalization in other dialects or languages where prenasalization has been observed.

"Anogenital distance in animals is used as a measure of fetal androgen action. Prenatal exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in rodents causes reproductive changes in male offspring and decreases anogenital distance. We assessed whether in utero exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds adversely influences anogenital distance in newborns and young children (median age, 16 months; range, 1-31 months). We measured anogenital distance among participants of the ""Rhea"" mother-child cohort study in Crete and the Hospital del Mar (HMAR) cohort in Barcelona. Anogenital distance (AGD; anus to upper penis), anoscrotal distance (ASD; anus to scrotum), and penis width (PW) were measured in 119 newborn and 239 young boys; anoclitoral (ACD; anus to clitoris) and anofourchetal distance (AFD; anus to fourchette) were measured in 118 newborn and 223 young girls. We estimated plasma dioxin-like activity in maternal blood samples collected at delivery with the Dioxin-Responsive Chemically Activated LUciferase eXpression (DR CALUX®) bioassay. Anogenital distances were sexually dimorphic, being longer in males than females. Plasma dioxin-like activity was negatively associated with AGD in male newborns. The estimated change in AGD per 10 pg CALUX®-toxic equivalent/g lipid increase was -0.44 mm (95% CI: -0.80, -0.08) after adjusting for confounders. Negative but smaller and nonsignificant associations were observed for AGD in young boys. No associations were found in girls. Male infants may be susceptible to endocrine-disrupting effects of dioxins. Our findings are consistent with the experimental animal evidence used by the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization to set recommendations for human dioxin intake."

In this study we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of eastern Mediterranean freshwater planarians of the genus Dugesia, estimated divergence times for the various clades, and correlated their phylogeographic patterns with geological and paleoclimatic events, in order to discover which evolutionary processes have shaped the present-day distribution of these animals. Specimens were collected from freshwater courses and lakes in continental and insular Greece. Genetic divergences and phylogenetic relationships were inferred by using the mitochondrial gene subunit I of cytochrome oxidase (COI) and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1) from 74 newly collected individuals from Greece. Divergence time estimates were obtained under a Bayesian framework, using the COI sequences. Two alternative geological dates for the isolation of Crete from the mainland were tested as calibration points. A clear phylogeographic pattern was present for Dugesia lineages in the Eastern Mediterranean. Morphological data, combined with information on genetic divergences, revealed that eight out of the nine known species were represented in the samples, while additional new, and still undescribed species were detected. Divergence time analyses suggested that Dugesia species became isolated in Crete after the first geological isolation of the island, and that their present distribution in the Eastern Mediterranean has been shaped mainly by vicariant events but also by dispersal. During the Messinian salinity crisis these freshwater planarians apparently were not able to cross the sea barrier between Crete and the mainland, while they probably did disperse between islands in the Aegean Sea. Their dependence on freshwater to survive suggests the presence of contiguous freshwater bodies in those regions. Our results also suggest a major extinction of freshwater planarians on the Peloponnese at the end of the Pliocene, while about 2Mya ago, when the current Mediterranean climate was established, these Peloponnese populations probably began to disperse again. At the end of the Pliocene or during the Pleistocene, mainland populations of Dugesia colonized the western coast, including the Ionian Islands, which were then part of the continent.

"There is a lack of data in Greece on trends in food intake according to weight status and physical activity (PA), despite the high prevalence of obesity. The present study aimed to examine differences in these parameters among first-grade children from Crete, Greece, over a 15-year period. Children (aged 5.9-7.6 years) from two representative cross-sectional studies participated during 1992/93 (n = 245) and 2006/07 (n = 257). Estimated 3-day food records were used to assess food consumption and energy-density (ED) [kJ g(-1) (kcal g(-1) )]. Moderate-to-vigorous-PA (MVPA) and cardiorespiratory-fitness were assessed by questionnaires and the 20-m shuttle-run test (20mSRT), respectively. In 2006/07, compared to 1992/93, both sexes had a significantly higher intake of dairy products and snacks (P &lt; 0.001), a lower intake of cereals (P &lt; 0.001) and higher cardiorespiratory fitness levels (P &lt; 0.001). Among girls, fruit/vegetable consumption was higher (P &lt; 0.05), although legume intake was lower (P &lt; 0.005). Among overweight/obese (OW/OB) children, ED significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) and the mean consumption of fruits/vegetables was higher (P &lt; 0.001). The percentage of OW/OB boys was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001); however, MVPA was significant higher in this group compared to 1992/93 (P &lt; 0.001). During the two time-periods, active children in 2006/07 appeared to have a lower ED than active ones in 1992/93 (P &lt; 0.001). Several differences in food intake were observed among first-grade children of Crete between 1992/93 and 2006/07, as characterised by significant increases in the consumption of dairy products and snacks and a decrease in the intake of cereals, among both sexes. Future school-based interventions in this population should emphasise the need to increase fruit/vegetable, unrefined cereal and legume consumption."

"Anogenital distance has been associated with prenatal exposure to chemicals with anti-androgenic effects. There are limited data in humans concerning descriptive patterns, predictors, and the reliability of measurement of anogenital distances. We examined anogenital distance measurements and their predictors in males and females and further estimated the reliability of these measurements. Anogenital distances were measured in repeated time periods among 352 newborns and 732 young children in two cohorts, one in Crete, Greece and one in Barcelona, Spain. Mixed effect models were used to estimate the between-children, between- and within-examiners variance, as well as the reliability coefficients. Genitalia distances were longer in males than in females. Anogenital distances in both sexes increased rapidly from birth to 12 months, while the additional increase during the second year was small. Birthweight was associated with an increase of 1.9 mm/kg [95% CI 0.1, 3.8] (CI, confidence interval) in the anogenital distance measured from the anus to anterior base of the penis in newborn males, 2.9 mm/kg [95% CI 1.8, 3.9] in anoclitoral distance and 1.0 mm/kg [95% CI 0.0, 2.0] in anofourchettal distance in newborn females, after adjustment for gestational age. In children, body weight was the main predictor of all genitalia measurements. Moreover, anogenital distances at birth were associated with the corresponding distances at early childhood. High reliability coefficients (&gt;90%) were found for all anogenital distances measurements in males and females. Anogenital distances are strongly related to gestational age and birthweight and later, to growth. They track through early life and are highly reliable measures in both sexes."

Self-reported measures of maternal depression (EPDS), trait anxiety (STAI-Trait) and personality traits (EPQ-R) were assessed in a sample of women during pregnancy and at 8 weeks postpartum (n = 223). An additional sample of 247 mothers also completed the EPDS scale at 8 weeks postpartum (n = 470). Neurodevelopment at 18 months was assessed with the use of Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (3rd edition). Multivariable linear regression models adjusted for confounders revealed that antenatal depressive symptoms (EPDS ≥ 13) were associated with decrease in cognitive development independently of postnatal depression. High trait anxiety and extraversion were associated with decrease and increase, respectively, in social-emotional development. Also, high trait anxiety and neuroticism had a positive effect on infants' expressive communication. Finally, postpartum depressive symptoms (EPDS ≥ 13) were associated with decrease in cognitive and fine motor development independently of antenatal depression. These findings suggest that antenatal and postnatal maternal psychological well-being has important consequences on early child neurodevelopment.

The main goal of present study was the development, optimization and application of different extraction protocols, especially those employing green technologies, in order to obtain from Berberis cretica extracts with high antioxidant capacity. For this purpose, the applied methods: maceration, ASE and SFE coupled with ASE were incorporated. The antioxidant assessment was carried out using DPPH and total phenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu) assays. Major constituents were elucidated using HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-HRMS/MS (hybrid IT-Orbital trap spectrometer) equipped with an ESI probe. The chromatographic and spectral data revealed the presence of several simple phenolic acids, derivatives of both caffeic and benzoic acids, and flavonoids in the produced extracts. It was clearly evidenced that the extraction method and solvents used affected both the activity and the chemical content of the results, significantly. The most beneficial conditions were calculated for methanol and water:ethanol (50:50) extracts derived from the combination of SFE and ASE methodologies. Obtained results classify Cretan barberry as a strong antioxidant agent.

"Estimation of the prevalence of vision impairment in a population can be performed using epidemiological research. The purpose of this study was to measure, using spatial statistics, the prevalence of ophthalmologic disease identified at visits of the Mobile Ophthalmologic Unit (MOU) of the Vardinogiannion Eye Institute of Crete (VEIC) to villages in Crete. The study also aimed to estimate increased 'risk' of ophthalmological disease according to demographic and location factors and, thus, use the present findings as a basis for planning future services. Estimation of risks for cataract, glaucoma, and refractive errors were assessed by multiple logistic regression models in order to measure the effect of demographic (age, sex) and location (province, distance from nearest ophthalmologist) parameters. Spatial analysis was applied in order to produce a density and probability density map of ophthalmologic disorders using kriging interpolation methods. Newly diagnosed cataracts and refractive errors were found more frequently in locations greater than 70 km from the nearest ophthalmologist (respectively, OR = 6.0 [95% CI = 1.637-9.482]; OR = 27.4 [20.038-39.028] &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value = 0.004). Those aged &gt;60 years had higher risk for all eye abnormalities: cataracts (OR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.238-0.938), glaucoma (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.227-2.037), and refractive errors (OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.183-0.829). The present study supports the use of local policies and preventive measures in rural areas of Crete in order to improve rural health standards. Some insights concerning the effectiveness of future visits of MOUs are provided, guided by spatial analysis."

"To evaluate the effect of corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) on corneal innervation, corneal sensitivity, and tear function in patients with keratoconus. Prospective, interventional case series. Twenty-four patients with bilateral keratoconus (30 eyes) who presented to the Institute of Vision and Optics, University of Crete, from May 2008 to October 2008. Patients underwent CXL. Confocal microscopic analysis of corneal sub-basal nerve plexus (total nerve length per image), corneal sensitivity (assessed with the Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer), basic tear secretion (assessed with Schirmer's I test with anesthesia), and tear film stability (evaluated by means of tear film break-up time [TFBUT]) were assessed preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively. Comparisons between preoperative and each postoperative value of total nerve length per image, corneal sensitivity, Schirmer's I test results, and TFBUT. Total nerve length per image and corneal sensitivity were significantly decreased until postoperative month 6 (for both parameters: P&lt;0.05 paired-samples t test at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively). Total nerve length per image tended to increase up to 2 years postoperatively, when it reached the preoperative level, but differences with the preoperative values after the sixth post-CXL month were insignificant. The results of Schirmer's I test and TFBUT had no statistically significant difference at any time point. A transient decrease in corneal innervation and corneal sensitivity can be observed up to 6 months after CXL. No significant effect of CXL could be detected on basic tear secretion and tear film stability in our group of patients.

"The aim of our study was to validate a Greek translation of the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) and to explore whether this screening questionnaire could be used to help identify primary care patients at greater risk of having OSAS. We recruited 189 patients visiting a primary health care setting on the island of Crete, Greece. They all completed the Greek Version of the BQ. Patients were then referred to a Sleep Disorders Unit for evaluation of suspected sleep-disordered breathing. A PSG study was performed in 129 of the 189 subjects (68.3%). BQ identified 74.4% (n = 96) of the patients as high-risk for OSAS and the remaining 25.6% (n = 33) as low-risk. The sensitivity and specificity of BQ for OSAS diagnosis were 76% and 40%, respectively, for an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) ≥5 per hour but &lt;15 per hour, 84% and 61% for an AHI ≥15 per hour but ≤30 per hour, and 79% and 39% for an AHI &gt;30 per hour. In conclusion, the Greek Version of the BQ is a useful instrument for identifying patients at risk for OSAS in primary health care in Greece. The findings of our study confirm that such screening tools should be used by primary care clinicians for OSAS prediction."

"The aim of this study was to translate and validate the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge scale (ADKS) in a population of Greek general practitioners (GPs). The international standards for the forward and back translation approach were followed. For the validation step, 112 GPs, treating dementia in their daily practices, were enrolled from Crete. The questionnaire was assessed for the following psychometric properties: intraclass reliability, test-retest reliability, and construct and face validity. Internal consistency of the Greek ADKS was satisfactory (α = .65). A high repeatability of the instrument was found during the retest with 27 GPs (intraclass correlation coefficient = 1.0). Factor analysis showed that all the items from the original instrument can be used in the Greek version. The inter-item correlation revealed a high cross-correlation between the items of the questionnaire (α &gt; .6). The data confirmed the validity of the Greek version of the ADKS for measuring GPs' knowledge on the diagnosis and management of dementia."

Discontinuation of thymidine nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tNRTIs) is the only proven strategy for improving lipoatrophy. It is unclear whether switching to NRTI-sparing or to non-thymidine NRTI-containing therapy has differential effects on body fat recovery. This was a 96 week, open-label, randomized study in suppressed patients with moderate/severe lipoatrophy and no prior virological failure while receiving a protease inhibitor and who had their triple NRTI regimen (zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir) switched to lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine for a 1 month run-in period and then randomized to lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine versus lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy. The KRETA trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00865007). Of 95 patients included, 88 were randomized to lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine (n = 44) or lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy (n = 44). Median (IQR) baseline limb fat was 2.5 (1.6-3.7) kg in the lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine group and 2.5 (2.0-5.4) kg in the lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy group. Six patients in the triple therapy group and 13 in the monotherapy group had discontinued study drugs by week 96. Although there were limb fat gains in each group at weeks 48/96 (+324/+358 g in lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine, P = 0.09/0.07, versus +215/+416 g in the lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy group, P = 0.28/0.16), differences between groups were not significant [difference +109 g (95% CI -442, +660)/-57 g (95% CI -740, +625)]. In lipoatrophic patients treated with zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir, switching to lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy had no additional benefit in limb fat recovery relative to switching to lopinavir/ritonavir with abacavir/lamivudine. These data suggest that non-thymidine nucleosides such as abacavir/lamivudine are not an obstacle to limb fat recovery.

To report the 2-year follow-up of the initial clinical evaluation of Infinite Vision Optics multicomponent intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Institute of Vision and Optics, University of Crete, Crete, Greece. Case series. All patients had routine cataract surgery and multicomponent IOL implantation. The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the manufacturing feasibility of the IOL, the evaluation of the surgical implantation technique, and the incidence of interlenticular fibrosis. This initial clinical evaluation comprised 6 patients with a mean age of 63.3 years ± 12.7 (SD) (range 49 to 82 years). Implantations were uneventful in all cases. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. There was no interlenticular fibrosis. There was no statistically significant difference in the endothelial cell density, anterior chamber depth, or pachymetry readings between preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively. No patient lost lines of corrected distance visual acuity. Multicomponent IOL implantation was easy and safe and resulted in excellent visual recovery. No cases of interlenticular fibrosis developed.

"In this paper, 981 reared juveniles of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) were analysed, 721 of which were from a commercial hatchery located in Northern Italy (Venice, Italy) and 260 from the Hellenic Center for Marine Research (Crete, Greece). These individuals were from 4 different egg batches, for a total of 10 different lots. Each egg batch was split into two lots after hatching, and reared with two different methodologies: intensive and semi-intensive. All fish were subjected to processing for skeletal anomaly and meristic count analysis. The aims involved: (1) quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing whether differences in skeletal elements arise between siblings and, if so, what they are; (2) investigating if any skeletal bone tissue/ossification is specifically affected by changing environmental rearing conditions; and (3) contributing to the identification of the best practices for gilthead seabream larval rearing in order to lower the deformity rates, without selections. The results obtained in this study highlighted that: i) in all the semi-intensive lots, the bones having intramembranous ossification showed a consistently lower incidence of anomalies; ii) the same clear pattern was not observed in the skeletal elements whose ossification process requires a cartilaginous precursor. It is thus possible to ameliorate the morphological quality (by reducing the incidence of severe skeletal anomalies and the variability in meristic counts of dermal bones) of reared seabream juveniles by lowering the stocking densities (maximum 16 larvae/L) and increasing the volume of the hatchery rearing tanks (minimum 40 m(3)). Feeding larvae with a wide variety of live (wild) preys seems further to improve juvenile skeletal quality. Additionally, analysis of the morphological quality of juveniles reared under two different semi-intensive conditions, Mesocosm and Large Volumes, highlighted a somewhat greater capacity of Large Volumes to significantly augment the gap with siblings reared in intensive (conventional) modality."

"Historian Ammianus Marcellinus documented the devastating effects of a tsunami hitting Alexandria, Egypt, on July 21, AD 365. ""The solidity of the earth was made to shake … and the sea was driven away. The waters returning when least expected killed many thousands by drowning. Huge ships… perched on the roofs of houses… hurled miles from the shore…."". Other settlements around the Mediterranean were hit at roughly the same time. This scenario is similar to that of the recent Sumatra and Tohoku tsunamis. Based on geophysical surveys and sediment cores from the Ionian Sea we show that the 20-25 m thick megaturbidite known in the literature as Homogenite/Augias was triggered not by the Santorini caldera collapse but by the 365 AD Cretan earthquake/tsunami. An older similar megaturbidite was deposited after 14.590 ± 80 yr BP, implying a large recurrence time of such extreme sedimentary events in the Mediterranean Sea."

We examined whether the Cretan cohort of the Seven Countries Study (SCS) is representative for the entire population in the island using cancer mortality registries. The analysis was carried out on the Cretan cohort of the SCS cancer mortality data and a similar cancer registry for the general population during a 51-year follow-up (1960-2011). Information about the causes of mortality was obtained from official death certificates and classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9). Two time-series models of mortalities from cancer, using data from the Cretan cohort and the Hellenic Statistical Office (EL. STAT), were developed using Matlab software. The existence of long-term memory in the data was tested by rescaled range analysis (Hurst-Mandelbrot). State-space reconstruction was applied to identify the simplest system that was able to re-create the present time-series. In the cohort, cancer mortalities accounted for 18.9% of total mortalities. The EL.STAT time-series analysis generated mean V statistics (95%CI) of 0.69815 (0.398-0.999) and 0.677143 (0.301-0.897) for the general population and the seven countries cohort, respectively. The embedding dimension for the EL.STAT data was equal to 1 for the general population and for the Cretan cohort (m=1). The exponent H values for the two time-series were almost equal. In the two time-series the proposed time delay of cancer mortalities was 2. The Cretan cohort of the SCS and the entire population of the island followed similar patterns of cancer mortality over time.

Both species of Ceratomyxa are new and referred for the first time as Ceratomyxa cretensis n.sp. and Ceratomyxa filamentosi n.sp. The new species are described morphologically by light and scanning electron microscopy analysis, and characterized genetically by sequencing the small subunit (SSU) rDNA. The SSU rDNA sequences obtained from the two novel Ceratomyxa species were used for the construction of a phylogenetic tree with all the available Ceratomyxa SSU rDNA sequences.

Ambient noise in classrooms may present a serious obstacle to the academic achievement of children. There is relatively little information on noise levels in teaching facilities in Greece and particularly in the island of Crete. The purpose of this study was to provide objective data on the internal noise levels inside kindergartens in Crete. The study was conducted in the city of Heraklion in the island of Crete, Greece. Ten kindergartens were selected and a total of 18 classrooms were chosen. Noise levels were measured in occupied and unoccupied classrooms. Noise levels in occupied classrooms ranged from 71.6 to 82.9 dBA with an average of 75.8 dBA. Noise levels in empty classrooms varied from 48.2 to 59.6 dBA with an average of 53.1 dBA. All values are well above international standards. Excessive classroom noise seems to be very common in kindergartens. Results may indicate that school facilities are not built in compliance with international standards. School administrators and local authorities should become aware of the problem, and make any necessary interventions to improve the learning capabilities of children.

Ependymoma cells are known to rarely exfoliate into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the frequency of CSF involvement in patients with ependymoma is unclear, and to the author's knowledge the cytomorphologic features of tumour cells have not been well described to date. In this study, the CSF findings in a patient with ependymoma and the cytopathological features of this tumor are reported. The patient presented at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, suffering from a chest to back pain. Computed tomography, scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed and a mass of 3x2 cm in the thoracic aspect of the spinal cord was found. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sent for cytologic examination and a diagnosis of ependymoma was made. A biopsy was performed and histology confirmed the cytologic diagnosis of ependymoma grade II (WHO). Exfoliated cells from ependymomas of spinal cord are rarely recognizable in CSF samples. Except in patients with myxopapillary tumours and anaplastic tumours, cytomorphologic features of ependymoma have been described only in case reports of intraoperative imprinting or fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) and not in CSF cytology.

"Thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) contributes to the appropriate management of nodular thyroid lesions. The introduced categories in the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology (TBSRTC) are associated with an implied cancer risk, providing a clinical management guideline. This study aims to evaluate the reproducibility of this implied risk and to compare the results from two different cytopathology departments. Five hundred histologically confirmed FNAs, studied since the introduction of TBSRTC, were obtained from 4208 and 3587 FNAs performed in a large regional hospital in Herakleion, Crete (group A) and a university hospital in Athens (group B), respectively. Reports were issued according to TBSRTC. Aspirates were prepared with ThinPrep(®) and evaluated by two experienced cytopathologists. The reproducibility and accuracy were evaluated. The proportion test for suspicious for malignancy (SFM) and malignant (M) cytology reports (P &lt; 0.0001), and the number of malignancies on histology (P &lt; 0.0001), were significantly higher in group A than in group B, consistent with a higher incidence of thyroid carcinomas in southern Greece. Although the malignancy rates were higher in group A than in group B for all categories, except M (A, 99.3%; B, 100%), the difference was only significant for benign aspirates (P = 0.0303). Malignancy rates for all categories in group A were above the TBSRTC recommended range, but were consistent with an increased prevalence of malignancy in that centre, differences in reporting practice and the variable ranges reported in the literature. There was lower sensitivity (P = 0.019) and overall accuracy (P = 0.003) in group A relative to group B, but no difference in specificity. TBSRTC provides valuable information for the appropriate management of nodular thyroid lesions, both in a university and a large regional hospital."

Understanding diversity patterns along environmental gradients and their underlying mechanisms is a major topic in current biodiversity research. In this study, we investigate for the first time elevational patterns of vascular plant species richness and endemism on a long-isolated continental island (Crete) that has experienced extensive post-isolation mountain uplift. We used all available data on distribution and elevational ranges of the Cretan plants to interpolate their presence between minimum and maximum elevations in 100-m elevational intervals, along the entire elevational gradient of Crete (0-2400 m). We evaluate the influence of elevation, area, mid-domain effect, elevational Rapoport effect and the post-isolation mountain uplift on plant species richness and endemism elevational patterns. Furthermore, we test the influence of the island condition and the post-isolation mountain uplift to the elevational range sizes of the Cretan plants, using the Peloponnese as a continental control area. Total species richness monotonically decreases with increasing elevation, while endemic species richness has a unimodal response to elevation showing a peak at mid-elevation intervals. Area alone explains a significant amount of variation in species richness along the elevational gradient. Mid-domain effect is not the underlying mechanism of the elevational gradient of plant species richness in Crete, and Rapoport's rule only partly explains the observed patterns. Our results are largely congruent with the post-isolation uplift of the Cretan mountains and their colonization mainly by the available lowland vascular plant species, as high-elevation specialists are almost lacking from the Cretan flora. The increase in the proportion of Cretan endemics with increasing elevation can only be regarded as a result of diversification processes towards Cretan mountains (especially mid-elevation areas), supported by elevation-driven ecological isolation. Cretan plants have experienced elevational range expansion compared to the continental control area, as a result of ecological release triggered by increased species impoverishment with increasing elevation.

"To investigate the effect of binocularity on long-term visual acuity in patients who have undergone bilateral implantation of a presbyopia-correcting diffractive multifocal intraocular lens (IOL). Twenty patients (9 men and 11 women) with an average age of 70 ± 7 years (range: 56 to 78 years) underwent bilateral implantation of a diffractive multifocal IOL (AcrySof IQ ReSTOR IOL, SN60D3; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX). Uncorrected visual acuity was measured monocularly and binocularly on average 26 ± 6 months following implantation in the second eye (range: 17 to 40 months) using the University of Crete European-wide modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts at the following distances: (1) 4 m, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), (2) 66 cm, uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UIVA), and (3) 33 cm, uncorrected near visual (UNVA). Mean ± standard deviation UDVA was 0.07 ± 0.10 and 0.21 ± 0.12 logMAR (20/23 and 20/32 Snellen) in the better and worse eye, respectively, improving to 0.00 ± 0.09 logMAR (20/20 Snellen) binocularly. Mean ± standard deviation UIVA was 0.18 ± 0.14 and 0.32 ± 0.15 logMAR (20/30 and 20/42 Snellen) in the better and worse eye, respectively, improving to 0.08 ± 0.15 logMAR (20/24 Snellen) binocularly. Mean ± standard deviation UNVA was 0.20 ± 0.09 and 0.32 ± 0.12 logMAR (20/32 and 20/42 Snellen) in the better and worse eye, respectively, improving to 0.11 ± 0.10 logMAR (20/26 Snellen) binocularly. Binocular summation, defined as the difference between the binocular and better eye visual acuity, was found to be statistically significant at all distances: 0.07 ± 0.05 logMAR at 4 m, 0.10 ± 0.11 logMAR at 66 cm, and 0.09 ± 0.08 logMAR at 33 cm. The results confirm that there is substantial benefit of binocular vision in individuals with bilateral multifocal IOL implantation in terms of increased visual acuity. This effect is evident at all distances."

The aim of this study is to investigate the potential use of reconstructed three-dimensional multi-detector computed tomography (3D MDCT) imagery to distinguish between perimortem cranial trauma and postmortem cranial damage. A total of 45 crania were initially examined for the purpose of this study. The postmortem group consists of 14 crania from a Medieval Scottish population while the perimortem group consists of 31 CT scans of perimortem trauma cases from the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete. Six crania belonging to the perimortem group could not be assessed for the purposes of this study. Each of the remaining 39 crania was examined under the following criteria: preponderant texture, preponderant outline, edge morphology, fracture angle, fracture relationship to path of least resistance, evidence of plastic response and the presence of hinging. As edge morphology could not be determined for any of the crania this criterion was not considered for statistical computations. Statistical analysis demonstrated the five of the six criteria (preponderant texture, preponderant outline, fracture relationship to least resistance path, plastic response and the presence of hinging) subjected to statistical analysis bore statistical significance in distinguishing between perimortem trauma and postmortem damage when using 3D CT images. This study, therefore, demonstrated that the timing of cranial fractures can be determined using 3D CT images and thus can complement and add to existing methods for trauma assessment in both forensic and archaeological settings.

The A/A genotype and the minor allele A of C1q SNP (P=0.0001 in both cases) were observed more frequently in T2D than in healthy controls. In contrast, the minor allele G of the rs11003125 MBL2 gene did not show any statistically significant difference between T2D patients and controls. The present study represents the first attempt to implicate the role of MBL2 and C1q gene polymorphisms in the susceptibility to T2D. The study has shown that the rs292001 C1q but not the rs11003125 MBL2 SNP are associated with increased risk for T2D susceptibility in the Cretan population."

"There is lack of data in Greece on the trends in energy and nutrient intake. The present study aimed to examine differences in these parameters among first-grade children of Crete, Greece, between 1992/93 and 2006/07. Children (aged 5.7-7.6 years) from two-representative cross-sectional samples participated during 1992/93 (n = 245) and 2006/07 (n = 257). Nutrient and food intakes were assessed using estimated 3-day-food records. Nutrient intakes were estimated as amounts per 4185 kJ (1000 kcal) of energy intake (EI), whereas macronutrients were estimated as percentage of total EI. Between 1992/93 and 2006/07, respectively, significant increases (P &lt; 0.05) were observed in the intake of energy (boys: 7996 versus 8646 kJ; girls: 7265 versus 7963 kJ), calcium (boys: 488 versus 587 mg; girls: 464 versus 594 mg), iron (boys: 5.8 versus 7.3 mg; girls: 5.7 versus 7.4 mg) and vitamins B2 (boys: 1.01 versus 1.17 mg; girls: 1.0 versus 1.16 mg) and B6 (boys: 0.80 versus 0.87 mg; girls: 0.75 versus 0.95 mg), for boys and girls, respectively. Among boys, the intake of protein (13.6 versus 14.6% of EI) and total trans fatty acids (TTFA) (0.84 versus 0.99 g) was also significantly lower in 1992/93 (P &lt; 0.016). Between 1992/93 and 2006/07, total fat (boys: 42.9% versus 42.8%, girls: 42% versus 43.1%) and saturated fat (boys: 15.5% versus 15.4%, girls: 15% versus 15.3%) exceeded the 30-35% and &lt;10% dietary recommendations, respectively, A significantly higher proportion of children in 2006/07, compared to 1992/93, had a higher intake of total energy (&gt;120% of the recommended energy allowance). The intake of several macronutrients (protein, TTFA, total and saturated fat) in this sample of children did not meet the recommended intakes in either time period."

Currently in physical anthropology there is a need for reliable methods of sex estimation for immature individuals and highly fragmented remains. This study develops a sex estimation technique from discriminant function analysis of the bony labyrinth as it matures before puberty and can survive taphonomic conditions that would destroy most other skeletal material. The bony labyrinth contains the organs of hearing and balance. For this reason biologists and paleoanthropologists have undertaken research in this area to understand evolutionary changes in locomotion. Prior studies have found clear differences between species, but within-species variation has not been satisfactorily investigated. 3D segmentations of the left and right labyrinths of 94 individuals from a Cretan collection were generated and measured. Mean measurements of height, width, size, and shape indices were analyzed for sexual dimorphism, bilateral asymmetry, and measurement error. Significant sexual dimorphism was detected for several measurements. For sex estimation, the single best variable was the radius of curvature of the posterior semicircular canal, which achieved 76% accuracy. Two multivariate functions increased accuracy to 84%. Although these equations are less accurate than equations for complete long bones and crania, they appear to be as accurate as or better than other techniques for sexing immature individuals and temporal bones.

The phylogeographic structure of the land snail Xerocrassa mesostena on Crete inferred from AFLP markers and mitochondrial cox1 sequences can be explained by three mechanisms: gene flow restriction, population expansion and leptokurtic dispersal. Gene flow restriction by geographic barriers caused subdivision of the gene pool into distinct clusters. Population expansion was probably facilitated by deforestation of Crete in the postglacial. Newly available areas were colonized by leptokurtic dispersal, i.e. slow active expansion resulting in isolation by distance within the clusters and occasional long distance dispersal events that resulted in departures from the isolation by distance model. Less than one percent of the AFLP markers show correlations with environmental variables. Random phylogeographic breaks in the distribution of the mitochondrial haplotype groups indicate that single locus markers, especially mitochondrial DNA, might result in a misleading picture of the phylogeographic structure of a species. Restriction of gene flow between metapopulations caused by geographical barriers can interact with sexual selection resulting in the differentiation of these metapopulations into separate species without noticeable ecological differentiation. Evidence for gene flow between parapatrically distributed evolutionary units representing different stages of the speciation process suggests that the ongoing process of fragmentation of the X. mesostena complex might be an example for parapatric speciation. The lack of ecological differentiation between these units confirms theoretical predictions that divergent selection for local adaptation is not required for rapid speciation.

The idea of safer sex has been explored in ancient and modern history, and has been used to prevent venereal diseases. We conducted a historical and medical review of condoms using primary and secondary sources as well as using the RSM library and the internet. These resources show that the first use of a condom was that of King Minos of Crete. Pasiphae, his wife, employed a goat's bladder in the vagina so that King Minos would not be able to harm her as his semen was said to contain ""scorpions and serpents"" that killed his mistresses. To Egyptians, condom-like glans caps were dyed in different colours to distinguish between different classes of people and to protect themselves against bilharzia. The Ancient Romans used the bladders of animals to protect the woman; they were worn not to prevent pregnancy but to prevent contraction of venereal diseases. Charles Goodyear, the inventor, utilized vulcanization, the process of transforming rubber into malleable structures, to produce latex condoms. The greater use of condoms all over the world in the 20(th) and 21(st) centuries has been related to HIV. This account of the use of condoms demonstrates how a primitive idea turned into an object that is used globally with a forecast estimated at 18 billion condoms to be used in 2015 alone."

"The first advanced Bronze Age civilization of Europe was established by the Minoans about 5,000 years before present. Since Sir Arthur Evans exposed the Minoan civic centre of Knossos, archaeologists have speculated on the origin of the founders of the civilization. Evans proposed a North African origin; Cycladic, Balkan, Anatolian and Middle Eastern origins have also been proposed. Here we address the question of the origin of the Minoans by analysing mitochondrial DNA from Minoan osseous remains from a cave ossuary in the Lassithi plateau of Crete dated 4,400-3,700 years before present. Shared haplotypes, principal component and pairwise distance analyses refute the Evans North African hypothesis. Minoans show the strongest relationships with Neolithic and modern European populations and with the modern inhabitants of the Lassithi plateau. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis of an autochthonous development of the Minoan civilization by the descendants of the Neolithic settlers of the island."

Maternal diet during pregnancy might influence the development of childhood allergic disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence during pregnancy on wheeze and eczema in the first year of life in two population-based mother-child cohorts in Spain and Greece. We studied 1771 mother-newborn pairs from the Spanish multi-centre 'INMA' (INfancia y Medio Ambiente) study (Gipuzkoa, Sabadell and Valencia) and 745 pairs from the 'RHEA' study in Crete, Greece. The symptoms of wheeze and eczema were based on the criteria of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. Maternal diet during pregnancy was assessed by FFQ and MD adherence was evaluated through an a priori score. Multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to adjust for several confounders in each cohort and summary estimates were obtained by a meta-analysis. MD adherence was not associated with the risk of wheeze and eczema in any cohort, and similar results were identified in the meta-analysis approach. High meat intake (relative risk (RR) 1·22, 95 % CI 1·00, 1·49) and 'processed' meat intake (RR 1·18, 95 % CI 1·02, 1·37) during pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of wheeze in the first year of life, while a high intake of dairy products was significantly associated with a decreased risk of infantile wheeze (RR 0·83, 95 % CI 0·72, 0·96). The results of the present study show that high meat intake during pregnancy may increase the risk of wheeze in the first year of life, while a high intake of dairy products may decrease it.

In this survey, we analyzed the phenolic profile of six herbal infusions namely Cretan marjoram, pink savory, oregano, mountain tea, pennyroyal and chamomile by LCDAD-MS and by GC-MS. Further, we investigated their anticarcinogenic effect as to their ability to (a) scavenge free radicals (b) inhibit proliferation (c) decrease IL-8 levels and (d) regulate nuclear factor-kappa B in epithelial colon cancer (HT29) and prostate (PC3) cancer cells. All herbal infusions exhibited antiradical activity correlated positevely with total phenolic content. Further, infusions exhibited the potential to inhibit cell proliferation and to reduce IL-8 levels in HT29 colon and PC3 prostate cancer cells. The molecular target for chamomile in HT29 seemed to be the NF-κB, while for the other herbal infusions needs to be identified. This study is the first to show the potential chemopreventive activity of infusions prepared from the examined herbs.

"We investigated the potential endocrine disruptive effect of prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) through maternal diet, by measuring anogenital distance in newborns and young children. We included 231 mothers and their newborns measured at birth from the Rhea study in Crete, Greece and the Hmar study in Barcelona, Spain and 476 mothers and their children measured between 1 and 2 years from the Rhea study. We used food frequency questionnaires to assess maternal diet and estimated plasma dioxin-like activity by the Dioxin-Responsive Chemically Activated LUciferase eXpression (DR-CALUX®) and other POPs in maternal samples. We defined a ""high-fat diet"" score, as a prenatal exposure estimate, that incorporated intakes of red meat, processed meat, fatty fish, seafood, eggs and high-fat dairy products during pregnancy. Increasing maternal ""high-fat diet"" score was related to increasing dioxin-like activity and serum concentrations of lipophilic persistent organic pollutants in maternal blood. An inverse dose-response association was found between ""high-fat diet"" score and anoscrotal distance in newborn males. The highest tertile of the maternal score was associated with -4.2 mm (95% CI -6.6 to -1.8) reduction in anoscrotal distance of newborn males, compared to the lowest tertile. A weak positive association was found between the ""high-fat diet"" score and anofourchetal distance in newborn females. In young children we found no association between maternal ""high-fat diet"" score and anogenital distances. In conclusion, maternal high-fat diet may be linked to high prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disruptive effects, resulting to phenotypic alterations of the reproductive system."

Sexually deceptive orchids mimic signals emitted by female insects in order to attract mate-searching males. Specific attraction of the targeted pollinator is achieved by sex pheromone mimicry, which constitutes the major attraction channel. In close vicinity of the flower, visual signals may enhance attraction, as was shown recently in the sexually deceptive orchid <i>Ophrys heldreichii</i>. Here, we conducted an in situ manipulation experiment in two populations of <i>O. heldreichii</i> on Crete to investigate whether the presence/absence of the conspicuous pink perianth affects reproductive success in two natural orchid populations. We estimated reproductive success of three treatment groups (with intact, removed and artificial perianth) throughout the flowering period as pollinaria removal (male reproductive success) and massulae deposition (female reproductive success). Reproductive success was significantly increased by the presence of a strong visual signal-the conspicuous perianth-in one study population, however, not in the second, most likely due to the low pollinator abundance in the latter population. This study provides further evidence that the coloured perianth in <i>O. heldreichii</i> is adaptive and thus adds to the olfactory signal to maximise pollinator attraction and reproductive success.

"Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) is a filamentous cyanobacterium used as a food supplement. The objective of the study was to determine the lipid-lowering effects of Spirulina in Cretan Greek dyslipidaemic patients, and to document its effectiveness as a possible alternative treatment for dyslipidaemia. Fifty-two adultCretan outpatients (32 men, 20 women), median age 47 (range, 37-61) years, with recently diagnosed dyslipidaemia, consumed orally 1 g Spirulina (Greek production) per day for 12 weeks. The full lipid profile was measured in fasting blood samples at the beginning and end of the study period. Anthropometric measurements including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, height, weight and body mass index were also recorded. At the end of the 3-month intervention period the mean levels of triglycerides, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, total cholesterol, non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoproteincholesterol were significantly decreased: 16.3% (P &lt; 0.0001), 10.1% (P &lt; 0.0001), 8.9% (P &lt; 0.0001), 10.8% (P &lt; 0.0001) and 11.5% (P = 0.0006) respectively, whereas the mean high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were not significantly increased (3.5%). Blood pressure, weight and body mass index remained almost unchanged. Spirulina supplementation at a dose of 1 g daily has powerful hypolipidaemic effects, especially on the triglyceride concentration in dyslipidaemic Cretan outpatients."

Eighty-nine percent of the participants considered information as patient's right and 88% as professional's ethical duty, 64% believed that the whole truth should be revealed, 90% avoided the word ""cancer"" in the communication and 39% disclosed cancer diagnosis at patient's direct asking. Respondents informed 1/10 of their new cancer patients, mainly due to perceived limited responsibility (23%), patient's low cognitive state (22%), fear of harming the patient (17%) and relatives' objection (15%). Sixteen percent of fellows acknowledged to themselves the responsibility to inform patients. Cooperation, compliance and arrangement of patient's personal issues were considered as benefits from accurate disclosure (88%, 83% and 75%, respectively), the latter more among doctors than nurses (p=0.01) and medical than surgical professionals (p=0.03). Thirty-six percent of the respondents considered the presence of a psychologist necessary during disclosure, nurses more than doctors (p&lt;0.001). Despite adequate theoretical background, Greek non-cancer specialists, doctors and nurses, initially inform accurately a small part of their cancer patients. Appropriate training programs for doctors and non-medical health professionals involved in cancer patients' management are required to upgrade professional-patient communication."

Flap thickness was assessed with anterior segment optical coherence tomography using the manual flap tool at 5 locations on a horizontal B scan. This study comprised 50 eyes of 25 patients (mean age 28 years ±5.72 [SD]); 42 eyes completed 6 months of follow-up. Preoperatively, the mean sphere was -3.61 ± 1.87 diopters (D) and the mean cylinder, -1.08 ± 1.23 D. Six months postoperatively, no eye lost lines of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), 29% gained 1 line, and 7% gained 2 lines. The mean spherical equivalent was -0.03 ± 0.42 D (range -0.88 to +0.88 D); 86% had an uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20/20 or better. The mean central flap thickness at 1 month was 102.98 ± 6.33 μm (range 91 to 114 μm). There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. No significant complications occurred after treatment with this new femtosecond-laser platform in thin-flap LASIK.

A survey of young tourists at seven airport departure areas in Southern European resorts. Questionnaires from 6502 British and German tourists were analysed exploring demographics, violence (verbal and physical), substance use, and reasons for resort and venue selection. Over two-thirds of respondents reported being drunk on their holiday, 12.4% had been involved in arguments and 2.9% had been involved in fights. Logistic regression highlighted more violence amongst visitors to Mallorca [arguments: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.7; fights: AOR 2.0] compared with those visiting Portugal, males (arguments: AOR 1.3; fights: AOR 1.7), those who had used illicit drugs (arguments: AOR 1.5; fights: AOR 2.9), those who had been in fights at home in the last 12 months (arguments: AOR 2.2; fights AOR 2.9), and those who had frequently been drunk abroad (arguments: AOR 2.4; fights: AOR 2.5). Those aged 16-19 years, visiting Italy or Crete, who were drunk for fewer than half of the days of their stay, and who chose bars because they were frequented by drunk people were more likely to report having an argument. Fights were associated with cannabis use and were negatively associated with choosing bars with a friendly atmosphere. Economic status or frequency of visiting bars had no relationship with arguments or fights. Understanding and addressing the variables involved in violence when holidaying abroad is critical in targeting appropriate health promotion and harm reduction measures."

"Load forecasting is a critical element of power system operation, involving prediction of the future level of demand to serve as the basis for supply and demand planning. This paper presents the development of a novel clustering-based fuzzy wavelet neural network (CB-FWNN) model and validates its prediction on the short-term electric load forecasting of the Power System of the Greek Island of Crete. The proposed model is obtained from the traditional Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system by replacing the THEN part of fuzzy rules with a ""multiplication"" wavelet neural network (MWNN). Multidimensional Gaussian type of activation functions have been used in the IF part of the fuzzyrules. A Fuzzy Subtractive Clustering scheme is employed as a pre-processing technique to find out the initial set and adequate number of clusters and ultimately the number of multiplication nodes in MWNN, while Gaussian Mixture Models with the Expectation Maximization algorithm are utilized for the definition of the multidimensional Gaussians. The results corresponding to the minimum and maximum power load indicate that the proposed load forecasting model provides significantly accurate forecasts, compared to conventional neural networks models.

A population-based, multi-stage sampling method was used to voluntarily enroll 876 men and 936 women (aged &gt; 65 years) from 12 Mediterranean islands. Demographic, behavioral, clinical, and dietary data were collected. Principal component analysis derived fruits, vegetables, and greens as part of the main dietary pattern across most Mediterranean regions. Surprisingly, Crete had the highest frequency of fast-food and sweets consumption. Malta had the lowest frequency of fish and vegetable consumption and the lowest MedDietScore. As Mediterranean populations gradually move away from traditional dietary patterns, public-health efforts to preserve these diets are needed."

Antenatal maternal mental health has been identified as an important determinant of postpartum depression (PPD). We investigated the occurrence of depression both antenatally and postnatally and examined whether maternal trait anxiety and depression during pregnancy were associated with PPD at 8 weeks postpartum in a prospective mother-child cohort (Rhea Study) in Crete, Greece. 438 women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Trait) questionnaires assessing antenatal depression and anxiety, respectively, during the third trimester of pregnancy as well as the EPDS at 8 weeks postpartum. The prevalence of women with probable depression (EPDS score ≥13) was 16.7 % at 28-32 weeks of pregnancy and 13.0 % at 8 weeks postpartum. A per 5 unit increase in the STAI-Trait subscale increased the odds for PPD by 70 % (OR = 1.70, 95 % CI 1.41, 2.05), whereas a per unit increase in EPDS during pregnancy increased the odds for PPD by 27 % (OR = 1.27, 95 % CI 1.19, 1.36). Our findings suggest that antenatal maternal psychological well-being has a significant effect on PPD, which might have important implications for early detection during pregnancy of women at risk for postpartum depression.

An 83-year-old Caucasian Greek man was referred by his general practitioner to the emergency department of the general hospital in Crete because of seizures and agitation. His past medical history was negative for any neurological or medical condition. Electroencephalogram showed a bradyarrhythmic theta activity, without evidence of any focal or other specific abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated a number of diffuse nodular lesions and moderate perivascular edema. An axillary lymph node fine needle aspiration cytology suggested a granulomatous lymphadenitis along with signs of tuberculous infiltration. Tuberculin skin test was positive. We report a rare case of extrapulmonary tuberculosis mimicking brain metastatic lesions.

"An observational seroepidemiological study was carried out in a well-defined primary-care district on the island of Crete in order to determine the recent endemicity of viral hepatitis in Cretan-population. The setting consisted of a semi-urban group and a remote &amp; rural group. Serum samples were collected from 876 subjects (437 males, 439 females) aged 15 years or above. Subjects were randomly selected from the permanent population of the area that consisted of 5705 individuals. The aim was to measure the prevalence of selected viral-hepatitis markers. Hepatitis B surface-antigen (HBsAg) was found positive in twenty-nine individuals, (3.3%). Antibodies to hepatitis B virus core-antigen (HBcAb) were detected in 287 subjects (32.8%) and antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were detected in nineteen subjects (2.2%). Seropositivities for the semi-urban group were: 3.4%, 19.1%, 2.1% and 3.2%, 48.8%, 2.2% in remote &amp; rural group respectively. Virtually, all subjects &gt;45 years old were seropositive for antibodies to hepatitis A, whereas approximately 80% of those in the 15-44 age-group were found to be seropositive. A threefold increase in the HBV exposure and carrier proportion was found in Cretan native-population and in rural-areas compared to older studies carried out in other rural-populations of the island. It is still unknown whether the recent economic crisis or the demographic changes in Cretan-population contributed to these findings. HCV endemicity remains relatively constant, however an alteration of hepatitis C genotypes was observed. Exposure to HAV was found to be higher in remote and rural areas compared to semi-urban areas."

"	Total phenolic content, antioxidant activity and phenolic profiles of six herbal infusions - namely rosemary, Cretan dittany, St. John's Wort, sage, marjoram and thyme were assayed. Additionally, the infusion anticarcinogenic effect as to their ability to (a) scavenge free radicals, (b) inhibit cell growth, (c) decrease IL-8 levels and (d) regulate p65 subunit in epithelial colon cancer (HT29) and prostate (PC3) cancer cells was investigated. LC-DAD-MS and GC-MS analyses showed major qualitative and quantitative differences in phenolic profiles of the infusions. All herbal infusions exhibited antiradical activity which correlated strongly with their total phenolic content. Infusions exhibited the potential to inhibit cell growth and to reduce IL-8 levels in HT29 colon and PC3 prostate cancer cells. The regulation reported in p65 subunit in HT29 treated with St John's Wort and in PC3 treated with thyme might point to the NF-κB as the molecular target underlying the effect of these infusions.

The aim of this study was to analyse data relating to the liver function profile during acute infection from murine typhus in the city of Chania in the island of Crete (Greece). A retrospective study of the files of all the cases with a diagnosis of murine typhus admitted to the Saint George General Hospital of Chania over a 15-year period (1993-2008) was performed. Variations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were recorded from three consecutive examined serum samples. A total of 165 patients were diagnosed with murine typhus during the above time period. Serum aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase were abnormal in most of the first examined samples. Remarkably on admission, serum levels of AST, ALT, and LDH recorded an increase above the cut-off point in 142 (86%), 114 (69%) and 136 (82.4%) patients respectively. More than two out of every ten patients presented hepatomegaly. In conclusion, liver dysfunction occurs frequently in patients with murine typhus. A high level of physicians' awareness is required for the liver biochemical abnormalities caused by this worldwide zoonotic disease, especially in endemic areas such as Greece.

Treatment strategies blocking tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) have proven very successful in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), showing beneficial effects in approximately 50-60% of the patients. However, a significant subset of patients does not respond to anti-TNF agents, for reasons that are still unknown. The aim of this study was to validate five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PTPRC, CD226, AFF3, MyD88 and CHUK gene loci that have previously been reported to predict anti-TNF outcome. In addition, two markers of RA susceptibility, namely TRAF1/C5 and STAT4 were assessed, in a cohort of anti-TNF-treated RA patients, from the homogeneous Greek island of Crete, Greece. The RA patient cohort consisted of 183 patients treated with either of 3 anti-TNF biologic agents (infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept) from the Clinic of Rheumatology of the University Hospital of Crete. The SNPs were genotyped by TaqMan assays or following the Restriction Fragments Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs) approach. Disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) at baseline and after 6 months were available for all patients and analysis of good versus poor response at 6 months was performed for each SNP. None of the 7 genetic markers correlated with treatment response. We conclude that the gene polymorphisms under investigation are not strongly predictive of anti-TNF response in RA patients from Greece.

"The ∼5.3-6.0 million-year-old evaporitic gypsum deposits of Cyprus and Crete contain a variety of stromatolites that formed during the Messinian salinity crisis. We recognize four stromatolite morphotypes, including domical, conical, columnar, and flat-laminated structures. Observations of morphological and textural variations among the different morphotypes reveal significant diversity and complexity in the nature of interactions between microorganisms, gypsum deposition, and gypsum crystal growth. Nonbiological processes (detrital gypsum deposition, in situ crust precipitation, syntaxial crystal growth, subsurface crystal growth, and recrystallization) interacted with inferred microbial processes (including localized growth of biofilms, trapping and binding of grains in mats, nucleation of gypsum on cells) to produce distinct morphological-textural assemblages. Evidence for biological origins is clear in some stromatolite morphotypes and can come from the presence of microfossils, the spatial distribution of organic matter, and stromatolite morphology. In one stromatolite morphotype, the presence of the stromatolite, or the biota associated with it, may have determined the morphology of gypsum crystals. In some stromatolite morphotypes, definitive evidence of a microbial influence is not as clear. There are broad similarities between the Messinian gypsum stromatolites and carbonate stromatolites elsewhere in the geologic record, such as the formation of precipitated and granular layers; the development of domed, columnar, and conical morphotypes; the potential for microbes to influence mineral precipitation; and the recrystallization of deposits during burial. However, in detail the array of microbial-sedimentary-diagenetic process interactions is quite distinct in gypsiferous systems due to differences in the way gypsum typically forms and evolves in the paleoenvironment compared to carbonate. Unique aspects of the taphonomy of gypsum compared to carbonate chemical sediments, generally speaking, include the following: the potential for growth of individual crystals to determine the shape of a stromatolite (and possibly vice versa), a more diverse set of outcomes relating to preservation versus destruction of textures through crystal growth and recrystallization, and a greater likelihood of preserving microfossils through encapsulation in large crystals. These insights gained from the study of terrestrial gypsum sedimentary rocks provide valuable guidance for the search for clues to past life in sulfate chemical sediments on Mars."

"Subjects with low/undetectable startle are usually excluded from startle studies but few reports not confounded by this factor, show reduced startle in healthy impulsive subjects, or clinical populations with disorders of affect and impulsivity but also in schizophrenia and its prodrome. We examined the relationship of startle reactivity including startle ""non-responding"" status to cognitive and affective personality traits in a large and ethnically/demographically homogeneous cohort of healthy males from the LOGOS study, Heraklion, Crete. Startle reactivity was monotonically related to sensitivity to reward (higher in ""non-responders"", lower in strong responders). In addition, ""non-responders"" had poorer strategy, working memory and sustained attention performance compared to responder tertile groups. More research in clinical and high risk populations is required to examine if low/undetectable startle reactivity is a valuable intermediate phenotype for disorders of affect and impulsivity. It is possible that the ""non-responsive"" status may capture disease related features such as executive dysfunction. "

Results from the SPILI III study. 	"This study aimed at exploring to what extent psychosocial factors, such as religiosity/spirituality and sense of coherence, mediate the negative effects of stress on a variety of cardiometabolic indicators, i.e., hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and atherosclerotic bio-clinical markers. A total of 220 subjects (66.2±16.0 years) of the SPILI III cohort (1988-2012) attending a primary care setting in Spili, a rural town in Crete, represented the target group for the present study. Of these, 195 (88.6%) participated in the re-examination (67.2±15.2 years). All participants underwent a standardized procedure including evaluation of anthropometric measurements, biochemical indicators of atherosclerosis, stress hormones, in parallel with ultrasound measurements of carotid intima media thickness (IMT). Religiosity, spirituality and sense of coherence were evaluated with the use of international questionnaires translated into the Greek language and linguistically validated. Participants with higher levels of religious and spiritual beliefs presented lower levels of carotid IMT (1.01±0.101 vs 1.53±0.502 mm, p&lt;0.001). Patterns of inverse relationships were also observed between religiosity/spirituality and prevalence of diabetes (35.1% vs. 2%, p&lt;0.001) with an estimated diabetes risk, fully adjusted odds ratio, 95% CI: 0.91 (0.87-0.94). Highly religious participants presented lower serum cortisol levels (12.3±5.8 vs. 18.2±5.1 μg/dl, p&lt;0.001). Sense of coherence was positively associated with religiosity/spirituality [mean SOC (SD): 123±20 vs. 158±15) p&lt;0.001]. These findings may be associated with a possible favourable effect of religiosity/spirituality on several cardio-metabolic determinants, therefore deserving further attention by healthcare practitioners and researchers."

"Stroke prevention is an urgent priority because of the aging of the population and the steep association of age and risk of stroke. Direct costs of stroke are expected to more than double in the US between 2012 and 2030. By getting everything right, patients can reduce the risk of stroke by 80% or more; however, getting everything right is a tall order. Roughly in order of importance, this requires smoking cessation, maintenance of a healthy weight, a Cretan Mediterranean diet, blood pressure control, lipid-lowering drugs, appropriate use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, and appropriate carotid endarterectomy and stenting. A new approach called ""treating arteries instead of targeting risk factors"" appears promising but requires validation in randomized trials."

"Water disinfection by-products have been associated with an increased cancer risk. Micronuclei (MN) frequency in lymphocytes is a marker of genomic damage and can predict adult cancer risk. We evaluated maternal exposure to drinking water brominated trihalomethanes (BTHM) in relation to MN frequency in maternal and cord blood lymphocytes. MN frequency was examined in 214 mothers and 223 newborns from the Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece, in 2007-2008. Residential BTHM water concentrations were estimated during pregnancy using tap water analyses and modeling. Questionnaires on water related habits were used to estimate BTHM exposure from all routes. Associations between BTHM and MN frequency were estimated using negative binomial regression. BTHM concentrations in residential tap water during pregnancy ranged from 0.06 to 7.1 μg/L. MN frequency in maternal binucleated lymphocytes was found to increase with BTHM concentrations in residential water for exposure during the first [rate ratio (RR) for 1 μg/L=1.05; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.11] and second trimesters (RR for 1 μg/L=1.03; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.06), and through all routes of BTHM exposure during the first trimester (RR for 1 μg/week=3.14; 95% CI: 1.16, 8.50). These findings suggest that exposure to BTHM may increase the frequency of MN in maternal binucleated lymphocytes."

To study desertification processes relating to soil erosion, a climatological and altitudinal gradient from south to north was selected in Crete (Greece) and four locations were selected along the gradient. At the locations precipitation ranged from 1400 mm/year at the highest location to 400 mm/year at the lowest. All locations are affected by the actual land use: intensive grazing, small controlled fires, and abandoned agricultural terraces. Representative soil profiles were described in the field and analyzed in the laboratory, and rainfall simulation experiments in the field measured soil erosion over different soil surfaces and land uses. Data on physical and chemical properties were obtained from the soil profiles and soil hydrology, and erosion data were obtained from the rainfall simulation experiments. Soil aggregation was studied with samples taken from the soil in the rainfall simulation plots and special attention being paid to the aggregate size distribution and the water-stable microaggregation. The interaction between climatological conditions and land use seems to be the main factor controlling soil erosion. This paper describes how the expected erosion along the gradient (from the most humid to the driest site) can be affected and disturbed by specific processes derived from land use.

The association between the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and enzymes involved in the folate metabolism has been under investigation lately. The reduced folate carrier gene (RFC) encodes reduced folate carrier, a protein that transports into the cell both folate and methotrexate, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug, has been proved polymorphic at position 80 (G→A). The role of this polymorphism in childhood ALL and its interaction with other enzymes of the folate metabolic pathway, including MTHFR, has been examined in different populations with diverse results. In the present case-control study, 35 children with ALL and 48 healthy adult blood donors, all originating from the island of Crete (Greece), were screened for the presence of the RFC G80A polymorphism, using PCR/RFLP techniques. The effect on ALL risk and methotrexate-induced toxicities, along with the role of gene-gene interactions in our population, were examined. No significant association was observed between the RFC G80A genotypes and either the development of ALL or the presence of adverse events. However, a significant association was detected between the MTHFR A1298C/ RFC G80A genotype and a nonpredisposition for ALL (P = 0.035). This study suggests that gene-gene interactions in childhood ALL may be of prognostic value in our population.

"Dietary guidelines to promote good health are usually based on foods, nutrients, and dietary patterns predictive of chronic disease risk in epidemiologic studies. However, sound nutritional recommendations for cardiovascular prevention should be based on the results of large randomized clinical trials with ""hard"" end-points as the main outcome. Such evidence has been obtained for the Mediterranean diet from the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) trial and the Lyon Heart Study. The traditional Mediterranean diet was that found in olive growing areas of Crete, Greece, and Southern Italy in the late 1950s. Their major characteristics include: a) a high consumption of cereals, legumes, nuts, vegetables, and fruits; b) a relatively high-fat consumption, mostly provided by olive oil; c) moderate to high fish consumption; d) poultry and dairy products consumed in moderate to small amounts; e) low consumption of red meats, and meat products; and f) moderate alcohol intake, usually in the form of red wine. However, these protective effects of the traditional Mediterranean diet may be even greater if we upgrade the health effects of this dietary pattern changing the common olive oil used for extra-virgin olive oil, increasing the consumption of nuts, fatty fish and whole grain cereals, reducing sodium intake, and maintaining a moderate consumption of wine with meals."

"Global warming is expected to change marine species distributions; it is thus critical to understand species current thermotolerance. The brittle star species complex Ophioderma longicauda comprises a broadcast spawning lineage L1 and a brooding lineage L3. We collected L1 specimens from Marseilles and Crete, and L3 specimens from Crete. We monitored survival, autotomy and arm regeneration at 17, 26 and 30°C during 14 weeks. Globally O. longicauda showed good resistance to elevated temperatures compared to other published studies on ophiuroids. The L3 sample displayed a better thermotolerance than L1 samples. Yet, more research is needed to establish whether these differences are due to lineages, geographic origin, or random effects. We provided for the first time individual regeneration trajectories, and showed that regeneration followed a growth curve and was highly influenced by temperature in both lineages. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account the presence of cryptic species when studying the potential effects of global warming."

"Although the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of uterine cervical cancer is well established, the role of HPV in lung carcinogenesis remains controversial. The detection rates of HPV DNA are subject to a wide variation from 0 to 100%. This is partly influenced by the detection techniques employed. To elucidate the impact of HPV infection on lung parenchyma, we analyzed 100 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens (39 squamous cell carcinomas, 50 adenocarcinomas, 5 samples with characteristics of both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, 5 undifferentiated and 1 large cell carcinoma) from the region of Crete, Greece. Sixteen non-cancerous samples served as the negative controls. DNA was extracted from 100 paraffin-embedded tissue sections obtained from NSCLC patients. The specimens were examined for the detection of HPV DNA by Real-Time PCR using GP5+/GP6+ primers. Furthermore, the HPV-positive samples were subjected to genotyping. In contrast to the absence of viral genomes in the control samples, HPV DNA was detected in 19 NSCLC specimens (19%). In particular, 4 squamous cell carcinomas, 12 adenocarcinomas, 1 sample with characteristics of both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, and 2 undifferentiated samples were HPV-positive. The distribution of HPV genotypes was as follows: HPV 16: eight cases (42.1%); HPV 11: three cases (15.8%); HPV 6: one case (5.2%); HPV 59: one case (5.2%); HPV 33: two cases (10.5%); HPV 31: two cases (10.5%) and HPV 18: two cases (10.5%). The presence of HPV in the tumor samples provides evidence of the potential role of HPV in NSCLC and strongly argues for additional research on this issue."

"The present study explored coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rates in 2011 in countries that participated in the Seven Countries Study (SCS) in relation to several dietary and anthropometric/biochemical risk factors. Special focus was given to Crete and the Ionian Islands. This was a cross-sectional study of secondary analysis of databases using data from the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization database and the Greek National Cadaster and Cartography Organization. Geographically weighted regression was applied to identify the high-risk regions in relation to the significant factors. Crete, the Ionian Islands and Japan had the lowest mortality rates (28.9, 30.1 and 31.2 deaths/100,000 people, respectively) in contrast to Serbia/Montenegro that presented the highest rates (105.1 deaths/100,000 people). Diet, physical inactivity and hypertension were found to be the most significant factors in the model (P &lt; 0.05). Regions of no risk were Crete, Ionian Islands and Japan (exponent B = 0.65; 95% confidence interval = 0.293-0.942; P &lt; 0.001), whereas Serbia/Montenegro and Finland were identified as high-risk areas with a 2.97-fold higher probability for CHD mortality (95% confidence interval = 1.736-4.028; P &lt; 0.001). Observed patterns of CHD mortality and related factors may be helpful for appropriate management by health planners when aiming to reduce its prevalence, particularly in high-risk areas."

"To compare blood pressure reactions (BPR) of infants to mild stress for evidence of adverse cardiovascular effects of passive exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy and early infancy. An observational field study conducted in Crete. We compared 4- to 6-month olds of lifelong nonsmokers minimally (controls, n = 9) or frequently exposed to tobacco smoke (passive smokers; n = 10) with those born to habitual smokers (n = 6). Smoke exposure was verified biochemically (urine cotinine each trimester and at study). We recorded beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) during brief repositioning manoeuvres performed during a daytime nap and analysed BPR (% change in BP during head-up tilt) for associations with maternal and infant cotinine. We observed a 20-fold difference between BPR of infants of controls versus passive smokers - exceptional given number of infants (α error/confidence level &lt;10% i.e. power &gt;90%). The BPR declined linearly as the infant's (but not mother's) cotinine level rose (p = 0.04), indicating abnormal BPR was caused mainly by postnatal smoke exposure. Infants of active smokers differed from those of passive smokers. Cardiovascular effects of passive smoking by a newborn infant manifest early on and are exceptionally strong. They can be largely avoided by keeping the home smoke rigorously free."

The coexistence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS) in the same individual has rarely been described. Our objective was to report on the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of cases fulfilling the criteria for both SLE and MS. We utilized existing patient cohorts from the Departments of Rheumatology and Neurology, University of Crete, and screened patients diagnosed with either SLE (n = 728) or MS (n = 819) for features of both diseases. The clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging findings were assessed. We identified nine patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for both SLE and MS, corresponding to a prevalence rate of 1.0-1.2% in each cohort. All patients were women, with an average age at SLE diagnosis of 42.1 years (range: 34-56 years). The diagnosis of SLE preceded the development of MS in five patients, with a time lag ≤ 5 years in four of them. Initial presentation of MS included spinal symptoms in seven patients. All patients had features of mild SLE with predominantly cutaneous, mucosal, and musculoskeletal manifestations. Accordingly, therapeutic decisions were mainly guided by the severity of the neurological syndrome. During the median follow-up of 4 years (range: 1-10 years), three patients remained stable and the remaining experienced gradual deterioration in their neurological status. SLE remained quiescent in all patients while on standard immunomodulatory MS therapy. Occurrence of both diseases in the same individual is rare, corroborating data that suggest distinct molecular signatures. SLE and MS coexistence was not associated with a severe phenotype for either entity.

In the case of L. pneumophila SG1, one prevalent sequence type was revealed (ST37). The variability of Legionella spp. observed questions the existence of a single ST of the L. pneumophila sg1 species and leads towards the need for a genetic level investigation of all Legionnaires' disease cases."

"Breast feeding duration has been associated with improved cognitive development in children. However, few population-based prospective studies have evaluated dose-response relationships of breastfeeding duration with language and motor development at early ages, and results are discrepant. The study uses data from the prospective mother-child cohort ('Rhea' study) in Crete, Greece. 540 mother-child pairs were included in the present analysis. Information about parental and child characteristics and breastfeeding practices was obtained by interview-administered questionnaires. Trained psychologists assessed cognitive, language and motor development by using the Bayley Scales of Infant Toddler Development (3rd edition) at the age of 18 months. Duration of breast feeding was linearly positively associated with all the Bayley scales, except of gross motor. The association persisted after adjustment for potential confounders with an increase of 0.28 points in the scale of cognitive development (β=0.28; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), 0.29 points in the scale of receptive communication (β=0.29; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.54), 0.30 points in the scale of expressive communication (β=0.30; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.57) and 0.29 points in the scale of fine motor development (β=0.29; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.56) per accumulated month of breast feeding. Children who were breast fed longer than 6 months had a 4.44-point increase in the scale of fine motor development (β=4.44; 95% CI 0.06 to 8.82) compared with those never breast fed. Longer duration of breast feeding was associated with increased scores in cognitive, language and motor development at 18 months of age, independently from a wide range of parental and infant characteristics. Additional longitudinal studies and trials are needed to confirm these results."

The nomenclature used within the whitefly research community for different putative species within Bemisia tabaci (sensu Russell) remains highly variable and confused. This was evident by the many different naming schemes researchers were using in their presentations at the 1st International Whitefly Symposium in Kolymbari, Crete, Greece (20-24 May 2013). I wanted to try to document how we, as a community, have arrived at such a state of confused nomenclature. This also included an investigation of the nomenclature used in the literature (from 2002 to 2012) by means of two online search tools (Web of Science and Scirus). Nomenclatural data were collected at the 1st International Whitefly Symposium, based on oral presentations and posters. There were 17 different names used for the MED species and 12 different names used for the MEAM1 species of the B. tabaci species complex. Investigation of the literature revealed limited uptake of the intermediate names. The intermediate names for the various species in the B. tabaci species complex - MED, MEAM1, New World, etc. - are not being used by the wider whitefly community. To move forwarrd as a community, we must work towards a formal revision of the B. tabaci complex.

Imidacloprid (IMI) is a relatively new neuro-active neonicotinoid insecticide and nowadays one of the largest selling insecticides worldwide. In the present study a LC–APCI–MS based method was developed and validated for the quantification of imidacloprid and its main metabolite 6-chloronicotinic acid (6- CINA) in urine and hair specimens. The method was tested in biomonitoring of intentionally exposed animals and subsequently applied for biomonitoring of Cretan urban and rural population. The developed analytical method comprises two main steps of analytes isolation from specimen (solid– liquid extraction with methanol for hair, liquid–liquid extraction with methanol for urine) and subsequent instrumental analysis by LC–APCI–MS. The developed method was applied for the monitoring of IMI and 6-ClNA in hair and urine of laboratory animals (rabbits) intentionally fed with insecticide at low or high doses (40 and 80 mg kg(-1) weight d(-1) respectively) for 24 weeks. The analytes were detected in the regularly acquired hair and urine specimens and their found levels were proportional to the feeding dose and time of exposure with the exception of slight decline of IMI levels in high dose fed rabbits after 24 weeks of feeding. This decline can be explained by the induction of IMI metabolizing enzymes by the substrate. After testing on animal models the method was applied for pilot biomonitoring of Crete urban (n = 26) and rural (n = 32) population. Rural but not urban population is exposed to IMI with 21 positive samples (65.6%) and found median concentration 0.03 ng mg(-1). Maximum concentration detected was 27 ng mg(-1)

Votive offerings to the healing gods were a common religious custom for the ill believers to achieve the expected cure. The dedication of votive offerings began in Prehistoric Crete and continued during the Classical Period, mainly connected with the god Asclepius. Most offerings presented healthy members, while in some rare cases a disease had been displayed. A unique votive offering, found in the Asclepieion of Corinth, presented an anomaly, bringing to light the religious beliefs of the era. The custom of votive offerings was absorbed by the Orthodox Christians and still remains a common practice.

University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Prospective comparative case series. One eye of consecutive myopic patients was randomly assigned to PRK-MMC, and the fellow eye was treated with epi-LASIK. Visual and refractive outcomes and corneal confocal microscopy findings were evaluated. All patients were examined preoperatively and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Twenty-six eyes (13 patients) were included. The mean follow-up was 2.47 years ± 0.35 (SD) (range 1.64 to 2.93 years). In the PRK-MMC group, the mean preoperative spherical equivalent refraction was -3.84 ± 1.59 diopters (D) (range -1.5 to -8.7 D) and -0.21 ± 0.44 D (range -0.5 to 1.0 D) at the last follow-up and in the epi-LASIK group, -3.91 ± 1.48 D (range -1.5 to -8.5 D) and -0.18 ± 0.36 (range +0.5 to -0.5 D), respectively. Qualitative analysis of the subepithelial nerve plexus, haze development, and keratocyte distribution were similar in the 2 groups. There was no statistically significant difference in endothelial cell density between the groups throughout the follow-up (P&gt;.05). Epithelial LASIK and PRK-MMC gave similar visual, refractive, and corneal structural outcomes in patients with myopia for up to 2 years postoperatively.

"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides bioaccumulate through the food chain and cross the placenta. POPs are developmental toxicants in animals but the epidemiological evidence on pregnancy outcomes is inconsistent. Maternal gestational weight gain has been recently suggested as a key factor explaining the association between PCBs with lower birth weight. We examined whether in utero exposure to current low levels of different POPs is associated with fetal growth and gestational age in a mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece (Rhea study), and evaluated specifically whether maternal gestational weight gain may affect this association. We included 1117 mothers and their newborns from the Rhea study. Mothers were interviewed and blood samples collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. Information on birth outcomes was retrieved from medical records. Concentrations of several PCBs, other organochlorine compounds (dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene [DDE], dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane [DDT] and hexachlorobenzene [HCB]) and one polybrominated diphenyl ether congener (tetra-bromodiphenyl ether [BDE-47]), were determined in maternal serum by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of birth weight, gestational age, and head circumference with each compound individually on the log10 scale, and with combined exposures through the development of an exposure score. In multivariate models, birth weight was negatively associated with increasing levels of HCB (β=-161.1g; 95% CI: -296.6, -25.7) and PCBs (β=-174.1g; 95% CI: -332.4, -15.9); after further adjustment for gestational weight gain these estimates were slightly reduced (β=-154.3g; 95% CI: -300.8, -7.9 for HCB and β=-135.7g; 95% CI: -315.4, 43.9 for PCBs). Furthermore, in stratified analysis, the association between POPs and birth weight was only observed in women with inadequate or excessive gestational weight gain. Small, negative associations were observed with head circumference while no association was observed with gestational age. The findings suggest that prenatal exposure to PCBs and HCB impairs fetal growth and adds to the growing literature that demonstrates an association between low-level environmental pollutant exposure and fetal growth. Furthermore our results suggest that the association of POPs, maternal gestational weight gain and birth weight is probably more complex than that previously hypothesized."

"Flonicamid is a novel systemic insecticide that acts as a feeding blocker with potential use against whiteflies within IPM control tactics. Flonicamid efficacy against Bemisia tabaci Mediterranean populations from Crete was examined, as well as side effects on selected beneficials used extensively in current IPM schemes. Low variability in adulticide activity was detected (&lt;tenfold), while there was no resistance compared with a reference susceptible population. Flonicamid exhibited low to no insecticidal activity on eggs, emerging crawlers and second-instar nymphs at the maximum registered label rate (RLRmax ). In long-term cage experiments, flonicamid at the RLRmax (125 mg L(-1)) caused 95% mortality to whiteflies 10 days after treatment and delayed population growth by one generation (32 days). Flonicamid significantly delayed nymphal development by increasing the development time (DT50 ) of treated insects by 7.2 days. Flonicamid did not affect the survival of Eretmocerus eremicus adults, while lethal effects of an intermediate level were observed on Nesidiocoris tenuis adults and nymphs, Amblyseius swirskii adults and preimaginal stages of E. eremicus. Flonicamid reduced the feeding activity (consumption of B. tabaci eggs) of N. tenuis and A. swirskii by 28 and 37% respectively. Moreover, the fecundity of A. swirskii was reduced by 36% after exposure to flonicamid. Flonicamid is an effective tool for the management of B. tabaci populations from Crete, and initial studies indicate that it could be combined with B. tabaci natural enemies."

"The aim of this longitudinal and naturalistic study was to compare aspects of imitative exchanges in dyadic grandmother-infant and mother-infant interactions. Sixteen Cretan Greek infants were video-recorded in the course of spontaneous dyadic interactions with maternal grandmothers or with mothers at home from the 2nd to the 10th month of their life (N=48). The present study provides evidence that in interaction between grandmothers and infant grandchildren and between mothers and infants, there is similarity in the frequency, the structure, the direction of imitation, the kind of imitated acts, and the temporal patterns of the components of imitation. Infants' age was found to affect the developmental curve of grandmothers', but not mothers', imitative behavior. In the frame of the theory of innate intersubjectivity, we assume that similarity in these aspects of imitation may be related to invariant fundamental dimensions of Significant Other-infant communication (""kinematics"" (temporal patterns), ""physiognomics"" (forms) and ""energetics"" (effort)). These similarities may have implications for both grandmothers' and infants' ability to regulate interpersonal challenges within an extended-family interactional context."

Deep sediments from the southern Cretan margin were analyzed to establish baseline levels for various types of organic pollutants before the anticipated intensification of anthropogenic activities. The total concentration of aliphatic hydrocarbons (ΣAH:326-3758ngg(-1), dry weight) was similar to those reported for deep sediments of the western Mediterranean Sea, while considerably lower levels were measured for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (ΣPAH:9-60ngg(-1)). Source-diagnostic ratios suggested that the aliphatic hydrocarbons in sediments were mainly of terrestrial biogenic origin, while polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons stemmed from the deposition of long-range transported combustion aerosols. Among the organochlorinated compounds analyzed, β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH:222-7052pgg(-1)), 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT:37-2236pgg(-1)) and polychlorinated biphenyls (ΣPCB:38-1182pgg(-1)) showed the highest abundance in sediments. The presence of HCHs and PCBs was attributed to historical inputs that have undergone extensive weathering, whereas an ongoing fresh input was suggested for p,p'-DDT. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the levels of the various pollutants in sediments were controlled by different factors, but with organic carbon content playing a prominent role in most cases.

Breast and cervical cancers are among the leading causes of female mortality. The reasons that make women adhere, or not, to screening guidelines are not only related to individual and health characteristics but are also placed in a wider social and cultural context. Social capital might facilitate the dissemination of relevant knowledge of and the adherence to cancer screening guidelines. This cross-sectional study explored the associations of individual-level social capital with breast and cervical cancer screening and the knowledge for the existence of relevant screening tests (Pap test and mammography) in the municipality of Gorgolaini, a rural area in Crete, Greece. A random sample of 131 of the 592 women of the 2001 electoral register were invited to participate in the study and 125 completed the Social Capital Questionnaire and two questions on self-reported health knowledge and behaviour (participation rate 95.4%). Women were eligible to participate if they were aged 35-75, had lived in the area for the last 10 years and were of Greek origin. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to establish associations among each social capital factor (total, participation in the community, value of life, tolerance for diversity, feelings of safety, family/friends connections) and knowledge of and adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening guidelines after adjustment for confounders. Our results suggest that early detection of breast and cervical cancers may be facilitated when taking into account the social context of the population.

The same zymodeme variant was isolated from a local dog that had never travelled outside the island, with symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis, which stayed in the area where the patient worked during the summer months. This is the first record of L. tropica in a host, other than human, in Greece and another example of introduction of a vector borne pathogen in a focus where local vector/s can sustain it, with the risk of initiation of new transmission cycle/s.

"There are few epidemiological and clinical studies about the presence of cat scratch disease (CSD) on the island of Crete. The objective of this study was to analyze a large number of patients with suspected CSD to define the frequency of Bartonella infections in Crete. From January 2005 to October 2008, we studied patients with suspected CSD from hospitals in Crete. Sera of the referred patients were tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). For some patients, we also received lymph nodes and blood samples that we tested for the presence of Bartonella henselae by molecular assays. Overall, we tested 507 serum samples and we found 56 (11%) cases of CSD. PCR assay was positive for 2 patients; one had a B. henselae positive lymph node and the other a positive whole blood sample. Significantly more CSD cases (62.5%, 35 of 56) were reported in children than in infants and adults (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, we identified that most cases of CSD occurred between May and September (P=0.002) and December and January. CSD is prevalent in Crete and is mostly associated with an increase in outdoor activity."

The prevalence of Primary biliary cirrhosis varies in different geographical areas. This might reflect genetic or environmental risk factors. We aimed to define Primary biliary cirrhosis prevalence and incidence, describe patient's spatial distribution, generate prediction maps and detect any possible routing pattern of time-spatial appearance of the disease in Crete, Greece. From 1990-2010, 245 Primary biliary cirrhosis patients diagnosed and followed up at the Gastroenterology Department of the University Hospital and the District Hospitals of the island, were contacted and 222 were included in the time-spatial analysis. To map their spatial distribution per 5-year periods, geospatial models were applied in Gis-ArcMap 9.3 software. Kriging Interpolation methods were used to generate prediction maps for the disease in Crete. Areas of high and low probability of disease occurrence were estimated through multicriteria modelling. The disease route was defined by Gis-ArcMap's toolbox. Prevalence was found to be 365 cases per million, with a mean incidence of 20.88 (range 3.79-35.99). Prediction map estimates from 1.22 to 11 patients per 50 km2 all over Crete. Areas of high risk of disease occurrence are located in the Eastern part, while low risk in the Western part of the island. Prevalence and incidence of Primary biliary cirrhosis in Crete are among the higher published in Europe. Given the homogeneous and stable study population and the geopolitics of the island, the heterogeneity in the time-spatial distribution and the route of disease appearance strongly suggest a role for environmental causative agents.

"In this work, we investigated Greek Leishmania isolates (n = 70) for their individual MDR1-gene-related p-gp (belonging to the ABC-B subfamily of permeases) expression levels by means of flow cytometric analysis of Rhodamine 123 extrusion kinetics. Of all used isolates, 5.71% express this drug-extruding ABC-transporter at alarming levels and are distributed widely over the country. Some 33% of all examined isolates originated on the island of Crete though none of the strains showed vastly elevated p-gp extrusion activity, indicating a reasonable implementation of anti-leishmanial compounds in this part of the country. Compared to isolates obtained from canine tissue, human Leishmania isolates were superior both in size and in subcellular differentiation in flow cytometry. Furthermore, a specific t test confirmed verapamil hydrochloride to be a highly potent p-gp reversal agent with p &lt; 0.0001. In a second test series, the loading of Leishmania with Rhodamine 123 was moreover reduced when occurring under influence of verapamil hydrochloride, a known p-gp reversal agent, indicating an ATP-dependant influx of the fluorescent dye and therewith the drug itself. In a final, third experiment series, it was shown that Sb(V) does not act upon the promastigote form of Leishmania."

"Geographically isolated islands are vulnerable during natural or technological disasters. During disasters, island health facilities should be able to secure power and water in order to continue operations. This study sought to determine the existence of Greek island health facility backup systems for water and power. When such systems existed, reserve capacity was quantified and compared to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Hospital Safety Index standards. A standardized, self-administered questionnaire was sent to major health care facilities belonging to the national health system in all Greek islands. The biggest facility available in each island was included (hospital, health center, or health post). For Crete and Euboea, all hospitals were included. Fifty-four of 85 facilities queried (27 hospitals, 17 health centers and 41 health posts) responded, for a response rate of 64%. Responding to the survey were 16 hospitals, 12 health centers and 26 health posts. In 70% of responding facilities (all 16 hospitals, 10 health centers, and 12 health posts) a backup water tank was available, while 72% (all 16 hospitals, 11 health centers, and 12 health posts) had a backup power supply system. Twenty-seven facilities provided data on water reserve, with 15 (56%) reporting a reserve for three or more days. Twenty facilities provided data on fuel stock and power consumption; six (30%) had energy reserves for more than 72 hours, and eight (40%) had reserves for 24-72 hours. Greek state-supported island health facilities responding to the questionnaire had water and power reserves for use in an emergency. Health centers and health posts were less prepared than hospitals. Of the responding health facilities, half had a water backup system and approximately one-third had power backup systems with reserves that would last for at least 72 hours."

"Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is a risk factor of respiratory, cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases, however its association with inflammatory markers among highly SHS exposed adolescents has not yet been explored. Participants included in this study were a subset of 68 non-smoking adolescents, aged 12.5-17.5 from the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study, recruited from Crete Greece. Smoking and SHS exposure was assessed via serum cotinine concentrations. Cytokines (Interleukin-1β, 2, 4, 5 and 6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, tumor growth factor-β1), immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgM, complement factors C3, C4, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and endothelial inflammatory markers [soluble E-selectin, soluble L-selectin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecules (sICAM-1) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecules-1 (sVCAM-1)] were assessed. Inflammatory markers in the lower 25th percentile and upper 75th percentile groups of cotinine levels were compared and multivariate linear regression analysis was performed controlling for age, sex and BMI. Cotinine concentrations were notably elevated (geometric mean 0.82ng/ml, 95%CI 0.62-1.07) in this study population. A significant decrease in IL-4 (130.09 vs. 25.77pg/ml, p=0.014) and IL-6 (19.52 vs. 5.52pg/ml, p=0.008) concentrations between the upper 75th percentile cotinine level group and lower 25th percentile cotinine level group was observed. In a multivariate linear regression analysis, cotinine concentrations had a weak inverse association with IL-4 and IL-6 (p=0.028 and p=0.06) which was not statistically significant when adjusted for multiple comparisons (modified Bonferroni, p&gt;0.016). No differences in the other variables was noted. Among highly SHS exposed adolescents, cotinine levels had weak inverse association with IL-4 and IL-6, which did not achieve statistical significance. However, our results potentially indicate an immunosuppressive role of SHS. Further research is warranted to explore this hypothesis."

The aim of the present study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance trends of respiratory tract pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs) in Crete, Greece, over a 4-year period (2009-2012). A total of 588 community-acquired respiratory pathogens were isolated during the study period. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common organism responsible for 44.4% of CARTIs, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (44.2%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (11.4%). Among S. pneumoniae, the prevalence of isolates with intermediate- and high-level resistance to penicillin was 27.2% and 12.3%, respectively. Macrolide resistance slightly decreased from 29.4% over the period 2009-2010 to 28.8% over the period 2011-2012. Multiresistance was observed among 56 (54.4%) penicillin nonsusceptible isolates. A nonsignificant increase in resistance of H. influenzae isolates was noted for β -lactams, cotrimoxazole, and tetracycline. Among the 67 M. catarrhalis tested, 32 produced beta-lactamase and were resistant to ampicillin. Macrolide resistance decreased over the study period. All isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, and the fluoroquinolones. Although a decreasing trend in the prevalence of resistance of the three most common pathogens involved in CARTIs was noted, continuous surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility at the local and national level remains important, in order to guide appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy.

Extracts from three Origanum species, including Origanum microphyllum, Origanum dictamnus and Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum, native to the island of Crete (southern Greece), were partly fractionated through successive partition with ethyl acetate and n-butanol. All the fractions obtained were profiled with regard to their major polyphenolic constituents, using liquid chromatography-diode array-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the antioxidant potency of each fraction was assessed by estimating the antiradical activity (A(AR)) and the hydroxyl free radical scavenging activity (SA(HFR)). The chromatographic analyses revealed a rich profile mainly for the ethyl acetate fractions, composed principally by flavones, which were accompanied by a limited number of phenylpropanoids, flavanones and dihydroflavonols. The highest values of antioxidant activity were displayed by the ethyl acetate extract of O. dictamnus, which also possessed the richest polyphenolic composition.

"The present study highlights the history of lazarettos in Candia (modern Heraklion, Crete, Greece), which was the most important Venetian possession in the Mediterranean at the time, while at the same time it recounts the terrible plague which went down in history as the Great Plague of Candia (1592-1595). The study will also attempt to give a satisfactory answer to the epidemiological questions raised by the worst epidemic that Crete had experienced since the era of the Black Death in the 14th century. The city was about to lose more than a half of its population (51.3%), although it was saved from complete annihilation by the composure, courage and inventiveness of its Venetian commander, Filippo Pasqualigo, whose report to the Venetian Senate makes an invaluable source of information regarding the events of this dramatic period. Candia would also witness the emergence of typical human reactions in cases of epidemics and mass deaths, such as running away along with the feeling of self-preservation, dissolute life and ephemeral pleasures, as well as lawlessness and criminality. The lazaretto proved inefficient in the face of a disaster of such scale, whereas the epidemic functioned as a ""crash-test"" for the Venetian health system. Eventually, in an era when the microbial nature of the disease was unknown, it seems that it was practically impossible to handle emergency situations of large-scale epidemics successfully, despite strict laws and well-organized precautionary health systems."

To examine the relative validity of an FFQ based on parental report for pre-school children in the mother-child 'Rhea' birth cohort. The children's mothers completed an FFQ that referred to the children's dietary intake for the previous year by telephone interview. Mothers completed also three food records, two on weekdays and one on a weekend day. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for the energy-adjusted values. Weighted kappa statistics (κ(w)) and the Bland-Altman technique were used to test the degree of agreement between the two dietary methods. Heraklion, Crete, Greece, 2011-2012. A total of ninety-nine mothers (corresponding to fifty-one boys and forty-eight girls) participated in the validation study. The mean and median values of all food group and nutrient intakes did not differ significantly between the two dietary methods. Overall, fair agreement was observed between the FFQ and the food records for ranking participants based on their intake, with κ(w) ranging from 0·21 to 0·40 for most foods and nutrients. On average, 88 % of participants were classified into the same or adjacent tertiles for nutrient and food group intakes by both dietary methods. The degree of agreement was also confirmed by the visual examination of the Bland-Altman plots. The study indicates that the Rhea 4 years FFQ is a relatively accurate tool for assessing habitual food group and nutrient intakes among pre-school children in Crete, Greece.

"	The aim of this study was to evaluate fetal exposure to organophosphate pesticides (OPs) by measuring their non-specific dialkyl-phosphate metabolites (DAPs) in amniotic fluid (AF), and to examine the potential association between prenatal exposure and fetal growth. AF samples were collected from 415 women during the second gestational trimester. The determined OPs metabolites were DMP, DMTP, DEP, DETP, and DEDTP. DAPs were extracted by liquid-solid extraction, derivatized and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 97.8% of AF samples were positive for at least one DAP. DAPs levels did not differ between urban and rural areas. Macrosomic neonates have significantly higher sum levels of DMPs (p=0.043), which exerted a linear positive association with birth-weight centile (b=4.43, p=0.016). Conclusively, as DAPs are detectable in AF they may be used as a potential biomarker of fetal exposure to OPs. Sum levels of DMPs appear to be associated with birth weight independently of other covariates.

When laboratory host specificity tests on weed biological control agents produce ambiguous results or are suspected of producing false-positive findings, field cage or open field tests can be used to help determine the true ecological host range of the agent. The leaf beetle Diorhabda elongata (Brullé) from Crete, imported to the United States for the control of saltcedar (Tamarix spp., Tamaricaceae), showed a low but variable ovipositional response to nontarget Frankenia spp. (Frankeniaceae) in previous laboratory tests conducted in small cages, where up to 11.4% of eggs were laid on these native plants. Results from field tests presented in this article show that no eggs were laid on Frankenia palmeri S. Watson and significantly more eggs were always laid on Tamarix ramosissima Ledebour than Frankenia salina (Molina) I. M. Johnston. Furthermore, the ovipositional response to F. salina was substantially lower than that recorded in laboratory tests. The percent of eggs laid on F. salina in field tests was 3.7 in a paired choice cage test, 4.3 in a multiple choice cage test, and 2.5 in a multiple choice open field test, suggesting that the true acceptance rate of the nontarget by D. elongata in the field will be lower than laboratory tests predicted. However, some damage was caused to F. salina by adult and larval feeding in the field, although this occurred only at the very end of the open field test, when D. elongata densities were extremely high, and all of the surrounding saltcedar had been totally defoliated. Scientific representatives from various stakeholder organizations (state, county, university, and environmental groups) viewed the open field test when in progress and reviewed the final results before advising State regulatory agencies on beetle redistribution. These test results, and the open review process, led regulators to conclude that redistribution of D. elongata in California was warranted owing to its significant ability to defoliate saltcedar, and its low rate of feeding on nontarget Frankenia spp. The introduction of D. elongata provides an interesting case study for risk assessment of a potentially efficacious weed biocontrol agent that may also be capable of using nontarget native plants.

"To present the results after simultaneous conventional photorefractive keratectomy combined with corneal collagen cross-linking for pellucid marginal corneal degeneration. In this prospective, interventional case series, 6 patients (8 eyes) with pellucid marginal corneal degeneration were enrolled. All patients underwent simultaneous conventional photorefractive keratectomy combined with corneal collagen cross-linking; corneal epithelium was removed by transepithelial phototherapeutic keratectomy during treatment (Cretan protocol plus conventional photorefractive keratectomy). Visual and refractive outcomes were evaluated along with endothelial cell density preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed in any of the patients. LogMAR mean uncorrected distance visual acuity improved significantly from 1.05 ± 0.33 preoperatively to 0.41 ± 0.27 (P = .018) at 12 months postoperatively. Mean corrected distance visual acuity did not change significantly (P &gt; .05) postoperatively. Mean spherical equivalent improved significantly from -3.52 ± 2.29 diopters preoperatively to -1.57 ± 1.76 diopters (P = .028) at last follow-up. Mean corneal astigmatism was significantly reduced from -6.83 ± 2.33 diopters preoperatively to -4.71 ± 1.89 diopters (P = .018) at the last follow-up. No endothelial cell density alterations were observed throughout the follow-up period (P &gt; .05). Simultaneous conventional photorefractive keratectomy combined with corneal collagen cross-linking seems to be an effective, safe, and promising treatment for the management of pellucid marginal corneal degeneration."

Garden Warblers Sylvia borin were studied during autumn stopover in Crete before crossing the barrier of the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert. Birds followed with transmitters show extensive stopover periods, which were longer in first-year birds, 16 days, compared with adult birds, 14 days. The distribution of body masses from birds trapped in fig trees were used to estimate the departure body mass and the results found indicate that both age categories on average depart with a fuel load close to 100% of lean body mass. The movement of transmitter birds shows differences between first-year and adult birds. Adult birds move further away from the release site and many also left the study area. Several were found settled outside the study area, up to 17 km away, indicating that they regularly make longer stopover movements. It is suggested that this might be a result of that they return to a place where they stayed during an earlier migration. It was shown that stopover site fidelity exists and nine garden warblers were recaptured in the area during a following autumn. The results found highlights the importance of stopover areas close to the Sahara Desert.

A common source of disturbance for coastal aquatic habitats is nutrient enrichment through anthropogenic activities. Although the water column bacterioplankton communities in these environments have been characterized in some cases, changes in α-diversity and/or the abundances of specific taxonomic groups across enriched habitats remain unclear. Here, we investigated the bacterial community changes at three different nutrient-enriched and adjacent undisturbed habitats along the north coast of Crete, Greece: a fish farm, a closed bay within a town with low water renewal rates, and a city port where the level of nutrient enrichment and the trophic status of the habitat were different. Even though changes in α-diversity were different at each site, we observed across the sites a common change pattern accounting for most of the community variation for five of the most abundant bacterial groups: a decrease in the abundance of the Pelagibacteraceae and SAR86 and an increase in the abundance of the Alteromonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Cryomorphaceae in the impacted sites. The abundances of the groups that increased and decreased in the impacted sites were significantly correlated (positively and negatively, respectively) with the total heterotrophic bacterial counts and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and/or dissolved nitrogen and chlorophyll α, indicating that the common change pattern was associated with nutrient enrichment. Our results provide an in situ indication concerning the association of specific bacterioplankton groups with nutrient enrichment. These groups could potentially be used as indicators for nutrient enrichment if the pattern is confirmed over a broader spatial and temporal scale by future studies.

The exposition to lead in the Antiquity is one of the first environmental health risks in the history of the mankind. In the ancient cultures of Egypt, Crete and Sumer there was no reports of an important exposition to this metal. The first clinical data is described in the Corpus Hipocraticcus, however was Nicandrus of Colophon the first to make a thorough description of the clinical manifestations of this disease. There was an increase in the exposition to this metal in times of the Roman empire and even some researchers propose that Julius Cesar and Octavio had clinical manifestations associated with lead poisoning. Paul of Aegina in the 7th century (a.C.) describes the first epidemic associated with lead intoxication, however in the Middle Ages the use of lead decrease until the Renaissance period in which lead poisoning affects mostly painters, metal-smithers and miners. Some studies done in the ice-layers of Greenland showed that the environmental pollution by lead during the Roman empire and the Renaissance was important.

Pneumocystis jirovecii (former carinii) pneumonia, is a life-threatening opportunistic infection occurring in immunocompromised hosts. The aim of this study was to investigate the predisposing factors, clinical features and outcome of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in HIV-negative patients. The medical records of 62 adult patients with PCP, hospitalized at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece during a 10-year period (2004-2013) were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were immunosuppressed prior to the development of PCP. Thirty one patients (50%) suffered malignant hematological disease, 16 (26%) solid tumor and 15 (24%) had chronic inflammatory disease. Only 17 (27%) had received long-term systemic corticosteroids. All had symptoms of pneumonia upon admission, while 12 (19%) were suffering respiratory failure. Twenty one (34%) had received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis before the PCP onset. Eight patients (13%) were admitted to the ICU. Mortality attributable to PCP reached 29%. Mortality attributable to PCP was higher in patients with solid tumors. TMP-SMX prophylaxis failed in a significant portion of the present cohort. Hence, PCP should be included in the differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients with symptoms from the respiratory tract even if TMP-SMX has been given as prophylaxis.

"To investigate all the important factors contributing to the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) as well as to explore the changes of these factors, over time, by comparing adolescent populations of rural areas of Heraklion, Crete, for the years 2011 and 1989. This study was carried out within two rural areas of the Heraklion region in Crete, Greece. The 1989 study was conducted in the village of Agia Varvara and the respective 2011 study within the municipality of Minoa Pediados. The study population consisted of 150 high school students (97 girls and 69 boys) in 1989 and 66 (30 girls and 36 boys) elementary (6th grade) and high school students in 2011, aged from 12 to 14 years old. Anthropometric, blood pressure and biochemical information was obtained. Of the MetS risk factors studied, only obesity incidence was found higher in 2011 compared to 1989 (obese adolescents 1.3% in 1989 versus 21.2% in 2011, p&lt;0.001). On the other hand, hypertension levels were higher in 1989 compared to 2011 (46.7% versus 6.3%, respectively, p&lt;0.001). In addition, glucose and LDL-C levels were lower in 2011. The present study supports the fact that there are significant changes in metabolic risk factors through time in adolescent populations of Crete, mainly due to the rise in obesity levels as well as to the decrease in hypertension, total cholesterol and LDL- cholesterol, as observed from the comparison of the years 1989 and 2011."

"The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the association between colistin consumption and the isolation of intrinsically resistant to colistin Enterobacteriaceae (IRCE) in a university hospital in Crete, Greece. The database of the microbiological laboratory was reviewed retrospectively during 2006-2010. All positive cultures for IRCE were retrieved. We assessed the total consumption of colistin in medical, surgical, and intensive care units (ICUs). A total of 1,304 single-patient IRCE isolates were recorded. Of these, 466 (35.7%) were hospital-acquired, while 838 (64.3%) were community-acquired. Proteus spp. accounted for 72% of them, Serratia spp. for 16.6%, Morganella morganii for 8.4%, and Providencia spp. for 3%. Urine (44.8%), pus (20.4%), and lower respiratory tract specimens (12.8%) accounted for the majority of specimens. IRCE isolated during the first half (2006 to 1st semester of 2008) and second half (2nd semester of 2008 to 2010) of the study period accounted for 5.8% and 7.4% of Gram-negative isolates, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Colistin consumption was not different in the two periods in the hospital, but in the ICU, it was higher in the second half of the study period (p = 0.013). Colistin consumption was associated with the isolation of hospital-acquired IRCE (p = 0.037); a trend was noted between colistin consumption and the isolation of IRCE in the ICU (p = 0.057). In this study, colistin consumption was associated with the isolation of hospital-acquired IRCE. The use of colistin increased in the ICU during the study period. Prudent use of colistin is essential for the prevention of nosocomial outbreaks due to resistant IRCE."

"The main clinical signs and symptoms caused by a rickettsial infection typically begin 6-10 days after the bite and are accompanied by nonspecific findings such as fever, headache and muscle pain. The diagnosis is mainly based on serological tests, however antibody presentation may be delayed, at least at the early stages of the disease, while seroconversion is usually detected 10-15 days after disease onset. Culture is difficult, requires optimized facilities and often proves negative. Under this scope, the presence of a characteristic inoculation eschar at the bite site may prove a useful clinical tool towards the early suspicion and diagnosis/differential diagnosis of tick-borne rickettsioses, even before the onset of rash and fever or serological confirmation. We describe herein the presence of skin lesions and/or an inoculation eschar at the tick bite site in 17 patients diagnosed, by molecular means, as suffering from spotted fever group rickettsioses. The detection of the pathogen's DNA in biopsy samples proved to be a useful means for early rickettsiae detection and identification. Moreover, the presence of an infiltrated erythema always seemed to precede the appearance of an eschar by 2-5 days and the initiation of fever by 1-10 days; these two signs might also prove useful in the context of the final diagnosis."

"The purpose of this study was to develop a rapid and cost efficient hair extraction method, using the headspace solid phase microextraction (HSSPME) technique for the simultaneous determination and biomonitoring of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane) (DDT) and its isomers/metabolites and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in hair samples. A total of 72 head hair samples were collected from children living in urban and rural regions of the island of Crete. Two hundred milligrams of hair were digested under alkaline conditions and thermostated for 30 min at 90°C while a 65 µm PDMS/DVB fibre was exposed into the headspace of the vial. Analytical parameters of the method (time of incubation, agitation speed, recovery, precision, accuracy, carry over, matrix effect, linearity, and selectivity) were examined. Recoveries of the DDTs in the spiked hair samples were calculated from 42.3% for opDDD to 87.1% for opDDE, while recoveries for PCB congeners were from 52.6% for PCB138 to 96.6 % for PCB28. The method was applied for the analysis of authentic hair samples. Significant differences (p=0.001) of the burden to total DDTs (sumDDTs) as well as of the frequencies of detection of positive samples (p=0.020) were observed between the examined regions. Moreover, significant differences in the detected concentrations of PCB congeners were observed for PCB52 (p&lt;0.001) and PCB28 (p=0.017) as well for their prevalence between urban and rural regions. Application of HSSPME for the biomonitoring of DDTs and PCBs biomarkers in hair was tested and successfully applied to the analysis of spiked and authentic hair samples. HSSPME was found to be substantially simpler and faster procedure than previous reported sample treatment procedures."

This essay studies Moses Galeano, a Jewish scholar with ties to Crete and the Ottoman Sultan's court, who traveled to the Veneto around 1500. After describing Galeano's intellectual milieu, it focuses, first, on circumstantial evidence that he transmitted information central to the rise of Renaissance astronomy. Galeano knew of theories that strongly resemble portions of astronomy texts written by Giovanni Battista Amico and Girolamo Fracastoro at Padua a few decades later. He also knew about theories pioneered by the Damascene Ibn al-Shāţir (d. 1375) that strongly resemble portions of Copernicus's work. Next, the article turns to concrete evidence showing that Galeano was part of a network of Jewish scholars who did have contact with Christian scholars in Europe. The essay concludes that, while it is impossible to prove that Galeano had direct contact with Copernicus, he most likely had contact with some European astronomer(s) in the Veneto.

We report on the serotype distribution and the antimicrobial resistance patterns to 20 different antimicrobials of 150 Salmonella enterica strains isolated from stools of diarrhoeal patients on the island of Crete over the period January 2011-December 2012. Among the S. enterica serotypes recovered, Enteritidis was the most prevalent (37.3%), followed by Typhimurium (28.7%) and Newport (8.7%). No resistance was detected to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems. Rates of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole were 9.3%, 4%, 2%, 15.3%, and 8.7%, respectively. Resistance to ≥4 antibiotics was primarily observed for serotypes Typhimurium and Hadar. Enteritidis remains the predominant serotype in Crete. Although low resistance to most antimicrobials was detected, continued surveillance of susceptibility is needed due to the risk of resistance.

The genetic impact associated to the Neolithic spread in Europe has been widely debated over the last 20 years. Within this context, ancient DNA studies have provided a more reliable picture by directly analyzing the protagonist populations at different regions in Europe. However, the lack of available data from the original Near Eastern farmers has limited the achieved conclusions, preventing the formulation of continental models of Neolithic expansion. Here we address this issue by presenting mitochondrial DNA data of the original Near-Eastern Neolithic communities with the aim of providing the adequate background for the interpretation of Neolithic genetic data from European samples. Sixty-three skeletons from the Pre Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites of Tell Halula, Tell Ramad and Dja'de El Mughara dating between 8,700-6,600 cal. B.C. were analyzed, and 15 validated mitochondrial DNA profiles were recovered. In order to estimate the demographic contribution of the first farmers to both Central European and Western Mediterranean Neolithic cultures, haplotype and haplogroup diversities in the PPNB sample were compared using phylogeographic and population genetic analyses to available ancient DNA data from human remains belonging to the Linearbandkeramik-Alföldi Vonaldiszes Kerámia and Cardial/Epicardial cultures. We also searched for possible signatures of the original Neolithic expansion over the modern Near Eastern and South European genetic pools, and tried to infer possible routes of expansion by comparing the obtained results to a database of 60 modern populations from both regions. Comparisons performed among the 3 ancient datasets allowed us to identify K and N-derived mitochondrial DNA haplogroups as potential markers of the Neolithic expansion, whose genetic signature would have reached both the Iberian coasts and the Central European plain. Moreover, the observed genetic affinities between the PPNB samples and the modern populations of Cyprus and Crete seem to suggest that the Neolithic was first introduced into Europe through pioneer seafaring colonization.

"To evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. This was a retrospective cohort of P. aeruginosa infections in cancer patients in Crete, Greece. Patients were followed until discharge. Mortality, predictors of mortality and risk factors for XDR P. aeruginosa infection were studied. Ninety seven episodes (89 patients) of P. aeruginosa infections (52 with bacteremia) were included in the study. In 22 cases, the infection was due to XDR isolates. All XDR isolates were susceptible to colistin and variably resistant to almost all other antibiotics. The multivariate analysis showed that the independent risk factors for XDR P. aeruginosa infection were hematologic malignancy (OR 40.7, 95 % CI 4.5-367.6) and prior fluoroquinolone use (OR 11.0, 95 % CI 2.0-60.5); lymphopenia was inversely associated with XDR infections (OR 0.16, 95 % CI 0.03-0.92). Mortality was 43 %; infection-related mortality was 24 %. Bacteremia (OR 8.47, 95 % CI 2.38-30.15), infection due to XDR isolates (OR 5.11, 95 % CI 1.15-22.62) and age (OR 1.05, 95 % CI 1.00-1.09) were independently associated with mortality. Mortality in cancer patients with P. aeruginosa infections was high. Infection due to XDR isolates was independently associated with mortality."

The Neolithic populations, which colonized Europe approximately 9,000 y ago, presumably migrated from Near East to Anatolia and from there to Central Europe through Thrace and the Balkans. An alternative route would have been island hopping across the Southern European coast. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed genome-wide DNA polymorphisms on populations bordering the Mediterranean coast and from Anatolia and mainland Europe. We observe a striking structure correlating genes with geography around the Mediterranean Sea with characteristic east to west clines of gene flow. Using population network analysis, we also find that the gene flow from Anatolia to Europe was through Dodecanese, Crete, and the Southern European coast, compatible with the hypothesis that a maritime coastal route was mainly used for the migration of Neolithic farmers to Europe.

Drilus beetle larvae (Coleoptera: Elateridae) are specialized predators of land snails. Here, we describe various aspects of the predator-prey interactions between multiple Drilus species attacking multiple Albinaria (Gastropoda: Clausiliidae) species in Greece. We observe that Drilus species may be facultative or obligate Albinaria-specialists. We map geographically varying predation rates in Crete, where on average 24% of empty shells carry fatal Drilus bore holes. We also provide first-hand observations and video-footage of prey entry and exit strategies of the Drilus larvae, and evaluate the potential mutual evolutionary impacts. We find limited evidence for an effect of shell features and snail behavioral traits on inter- and intra-specifically differing predation rates. We also find that Drilus predators adjust their predation behavior based on specific shell traits of the prey. In conclusion, we suggest that, with these baseline data, this interesting predator-prey system will be available for further, detailed more evolutionary ecology studies.

"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a potentially life-threatening condition that often requires hospitalisation particularly in the elderly population or in patients with comorbidities. The aims of this study were to estimate the CAP frequency and severity in a well-defined primary healthcare setting in rural Crete, to record patient characteristics, their immunisation status and to estimate hospitalisation frequency and determinants. An observational study was designed and implemented in a rural setting within the prefecture of Heraklion in the island of Crete, Greece. Eligible patients were those aged 50 years or above, presenting with CAP based on signs and symptoms and positive X-ray findings. A total of 124 CAP cases were recorded, 40 of which (32.3%) were hospitalised. Τhe age-standardised CAP incidence was estimated to be 236.7 cases per 100,000 persons aged ≥50 years. Forty-three patients (35.2%) were vaccinated against pneumococcus. The most frequent chronic illnesses were heart disease (64.5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (32.5%), and type 2 diabetes (21%). Hospitalisation determinants included advanced age (≥74 years, Odds ratio (OR) 7.13; P value=0.001; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.23-22.79), obesity (OR 3.36, P=0.037; 95% CI, 1.08-10.52), ≥40 pack-years of smoking (OR 3.82, P value=0.040; 95% CI, 1.07-18.42), presence of multimorbidity (OR 5.77, P value=0.003; 95% CI, 1.81-18.42) and pneumococcal vaccination (OR 0.29, P value=0.041; 95% CI, 0.09-0.95). This study highlighted patient characteristics and aspects of CAP epidemiology in the context of a rural primary care setting in southern Europe where limited data have been published until now."

Studies on determinants affecting family functioning of patients with psychosis are still limited in Greece. The aim of this study was to describe the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics associated with family functioning in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in Crete, Greece. A total of 100 patients and their caregivers agreed to participate in the study. Family functioning was assessed in terms of cohesion, adaptability, communication and satisfaction dimensions (Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale IV Package), expressed emotion (Family Questionnaire), family burden (Family Burden Scale) and caregivers' psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-28). Multivariate linear regression models were implemented to examine the associations between each one of the family measures and different social and clinical characteristics. With regard to the caregivers' characteristics, gender, employment status, origin, residence, financial status, relation to the patient, contact with the patient and family structure were among the most significant determinants of family functioning. Also, patients' socio-demographic characteristics, including age, education, origin, residence and employment status, as well as illness-related factors, such as onset of mental illness, number of hospitalisations, last hospitalisation, longer hospitalisation and clinical diagnosis impacted intrafamilial relationships. The results of this study suggest that a number of social and clinical factors contributed to the family environment of patients with psychosis. Identifying the determinants of family functioning in psychosis is instrumental in developing understandings regarding the factors which may contribute to the rehabilitation or relapse of the patient and the support required to strengthen positive family interactions.
PMID:25022313	Tiberti MM, Basili R, Vannoli P	Sci Rep. 4:5677	2014	Ups and downs in western Crete (Hellenic subduction zone). 	Studies of past sea-level markers are commonly used to unveil the tectonic history and seismic behavior of subduction zones. We present new evidence on vertical motions of the Hellenic subduction zone as resulting from a suite of Late Pleistocene - Holocene shorelines in western Crete (Greece). Shoreline ages obtained by AMS radiocarbon dating of seashells, together with the reappraisal of shoreline ages from previous works, testify a long-term uplift rate of 2.5-2.7 mm/y. This average value, however, includes periods in which the vertical motions vary significantly: 2.6-3.2 mm/y subsidence rate from 42 ka to 23 ka, followed by ~7.7 mm/y sustained uplift rate from 23 ka to present. The last ~5 ky shows a relatively slower uplift rate of 3.0-3.3 mm/y, yet slightly higher than the long-term average. A preliminary tectonic model attempts at explaining these up and down motions by across-strike partitioning of fault activity in the subduction zone.

Dactylis glomerata L. is an important forage species in the Mediterranean region, and in other regions with a similar climate. Genetic material from 3 locations in north, central, and south Greece was studied, using morphological traits, SSR, and ISSR molecular markers. Morphological analysis revealed differences among the geographic locations studied for all morphological traits, except the number of reproductive tillers. Moreover, the highest phenotypic variation was observed on the accessions from south, while the lowest was observed on the accessions from the north. Although the results of the molecular marker analysis are indicative, a high level of genetic diversity at the species level was revealed by ISSRs (GST=0.291) and SSRs (FST=0.186). Analysis of molecular variance showed that a high level of genetic diversity existed for ISSRs and SSRs within populations (62 and 83%, respectively), rather than among populations (38 and 17%, respectively). Cluster analysis divided the 3 populations in 2 groups, with the population originating from the island of Crete forming 1 group, while the populations from north Greece (Taxiarchis) and central Greece (Pertouli) were clustered in a 2nd group. In general, the results indicate that SSRs are more informative compared to ISSRs about the genetic variation within a population, whereas the ISSRs were more informative about the genetic diversity among populations However, a similar trend in diversity (genotypic and phenotypic) was observed in the morphological traits and microsatellite-based (SSR/ISSR) markers at the locations studied.

"This article reports the results of an observation study, aimed at exploring an association between spirituality, religiousness, and sense of coherence in a population group residing in a rural area of Crete, Greece. The study was conducted during the period 2007-2009. Subjects aged 65 years and older (n = 118) living in two remote and rural villages in the Heraklion county (Crete) were eligible. Eighty-nine people (51 women and 38 men) participated. Demographic data were obtained, and all participants were asked to complete the Greek version of the self-reported Royal Free Interview for Spiritual and Religious Beliefs, and the Sense of Coherence Scale. Most participants reported strong religious beliefs and this was found to be related with increased age. Widowed participants expressed greater religiousness and spirituality (p = 0.029). The total score for Sense of Coherence was negatively correlated with gender (women have lower scores, p &lt; 0.05), marital status (widows presented lower scores, p &lt; 0.001), and increased age. A strong positive correlation of the Sense of Coherence score with the Spiritual Scale as measured by three questions of the Royal Free Interview was also identified (p = 0.039). The impact of gender and marital status seem to be emerging determinants in defining sense of coherence among inhabitants of rural Crete. The positive association between religious/spiritual beliefs and sense of coherence deserves further attention to promote a multidimensional approach in its study."

Patients with progressive keratoconus had CXL using a new treatment protocol with 9 mW/cm(2) irradiance for duration of 10 minutes. The rate of reepithelialization, endothelial cell density (ECD), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and steep and flat keratometry (K) values were evaluated preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Nine patients (10 eyes) were enrolled. No intraoperative or early postoperative complications were observed in any patient. The ECD did not change significantly 3 months postoperatively (P=.169). The CDVA improved from 0.19 logMAR ± 0.20 (SD) preoperatively to 0.10 ± 0.16 logMAR 3 months postoperatively; however, the improvement did not attain significance (P=.141). No eye lost lines of CDVA. The mean steep K readings decreased significantly from 48.04 ± 2.57 diopters (D) preoperatively to 46.51 ± 2.81 D 3 months postoperatively (P=.047); the mean flat K readings did not change significantly postoperatively (P=.285). Corneal collagen crosslinking at 9 mW/cm(2) irradiance for 10 minutes did not cause significant changes in ECD or intraoperative or early postoperative complications.

To estimate the associations of individual maternal social capital and social capital dimensions (Participation in the Community, Feelings of Safety, Value of Life and Social Agency, Tolerance of Diversity) with adherence to the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy. This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from a prospective mother-child cohort (Rhea Study). Participants completed a social capital questionnaire and an FFQ in mid-pregnancy. Mediterranean diet adherence was evaluated through an a priori score ranging from 0 to 8 (minimal-maximal adherence). Maternal social capital scores were categorized into three groups: the upper 10 % was the high social capital group, the middle 80 % was the medium and the lowest 10 % was the low social capital group. Multivariable log-binomial and linear regression models adjusted for confounders were performed. Heraklion, Crete, Greece. A total of 377 women with singleton pregnancies. High maternal Total Social Capital was associated with an increase of almost 1 point in Mediterranean diet score (highest v. lowest group: β coefficient=0·95, 95 % CI 0·23, 1·68), after adjustment for confounders. Similar dose-response effects were noted for the scale Tolerance of Diversity (highest v. lowest group: adjusted β coefficient=1·08, 95 % CI 0·39, 1·77). Individual social capital and tolerance of diversity are associated with adherence to the Mediterranean diet in pregnancy. Women with higher social capital may exhibit a higher sense of obligation to themselves and to others that may lead to proactive nutrition-related activities. Less tolerant women may not provide the opportunity to new healthier, but unfamiliar, nutritional recommendations to become part of their regular diet.

"This study combines bathymetric, geomorphological, geological data and oil spill predictions to model the impact of oil spills in two accident scenarios from offshore Crete, Eastern Mediterranean. The aim is to present a new three-step method of use by emergency teams and local authorities in the assessment of shoreline and offshore susceptibility to oil spills. The three-step method comprises: (1) real-time analyses of bathymetric, geomorphological, geological and oceanographic data; (2) oil dispersion simulations under known wind and sea current conditions; and (3) the compilation of final hazard maps based on information from (1) and (2) and on shoreline susceptibility data. The results in this paper show that zones of high to very-high susceptibility around the island of Crete are related to: (a) offshore bathymetric features, including the presence of offshore scarps and seamounts; (b) shoreline geology, and (c) the presence near the shore of sedimentary basins filled with unconsolidated deposits of high permeability. Oil spills, under particular weather and oceanographic conditions, may quickly spread and reach the shoreline 5-96 h after the initial accident. As a corollary of this work, we present the South Aegean region around Crete as a valid case-study for confined marine basins, narrow seaways, or interior seas around island groups."

Vardinoyiannion Eye Institute of Crete, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Prospective case series. Patients with progressive keratoconus had combined transepithelial PTK and CXL (Cretan protocol). Visual and refractive outcomes and the endothelial cell density (ECD) were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Twenty patients (23 eyes) were enrolled; postoperatively 23 eyes were evaluated at 1 and 2 years, 11 at 3 years, and 7 at 4 years. The mean follow-up was 33.83 months±10.82 (SD) (range 24 to 56 months). No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. The mean uncorrected distance visual acuity improved significantly from 0.99±0.57 logMAR preoperatively to 0.61±0.36 logMAR at the last follow-up (P&lt;.001) and the mean corrected distance visual acuity, from 0.27±0.24 logMAR to 0.17±0.14 logMAR (P=.018), respectively.

"CRIPTO-(CR)1 is a protein associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here we demonstrate that CR-1 expression in normal and creta placentas is associated with various degrees of uterine invasion. Cytokeratin (CK) and CR-1 protein expression was visualized by immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded placental specimens (control placentas, n = 9; accreta, n = 6; increta, n = 10; percreta, n = 15). The pattern of extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cell morphology was distinctive in creta placentas: densely-compacted cell columns and large star-shaped cells with a typically migratory phenotype, not common among third trimester control placentas. Quantification revealed higher CR-1 immunoreactivities in accreta (P = 0.001), increta (P = 0.0002), and percreta placentas (P = 0.001) than in controls. In contrast to controls, there was a significant positive relationship between CR-1 and CK reactivity in all creta placentas (accreta, P = 0.02; increta, P = 0.0001, and percreta, P = 0.025). This study demonstrated CR-1 expression in the placental bed, its increased expression in creta placentas, and EVT cells as the main CR-1-producing cell type. Morphological examination revealed an immature and invasive trophoblast profile in creta placentas, suggesting impairment of the trophoblast differentiation pathway. These findings provide important new insights into the pathophysiology of abnormal creta placentation and its gestational consequences."

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure of rural residents (control group) and occupational exposed population group of sprayers to organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) by measuring their non-specific dialkylphosphate metabolites (DAPs) in hair and in urine samples. All subjects (n=120) were residents of the municipality of Ierapetra, an area of intensive cultivation in Crete, Greece. The determined OPs metabolites were DMP, DEP, DETP and DEDTP. Two different approaches were used for the analysis of the collected samples; solid-liquid extraction with sonication for hair and liquid-liquid extraction for urine. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed after derivatization of the isolated analytes. The detection rates of DMP, DEP and DETP for both control and sprayers groups were high in both matrices, ranging from 91% to 100%. DEDTP was detected only in 9% of sprayers hair samples, while its detection rates in urine samples ranged from 83% to 90% for both population groups. Data analysis revealed significantly higher sumDAPs levels in urine of sprayers than in the urine of control group (p&lt;0.001) and this is justified since sampling occurred during spraying periods. SumDAPs levels in hair samples of the sprayers were also significantly higher than in the hair of control group (p&lt;0.001), confirming the long-term exposure to OPs. SumDAPs found levels in urine and hair samples of subjects were significantly correlated (Spearman׳s rho=0.728, p&lt;0.001). Our study confirmed the elevated levels of DAPs in hair and urine samples in occupationally exposed group of sprayers in comparison to control group, even detected levels were similar in logarithmic scale."

PMID:25215655	Jeong S, Moon HS, Nam K	J Hazard Mater. 280:536-43	2014	Enhanced uptake and translocation of arsenic in Cretan brake fern (Pteris cretica L.) through siderophorearsenic complex formation with an aid of rhizospheric bacterial activity. 	"Siderophores, produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, released slightly more Fe (53.6 μmol) than that chelated by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; i.e. 43.7 μmol) in batch experiment using As-adsorbed ferrihydrite. More importantly, about 1.79 μmol of As was found to be associated with siderophores in the aqueous phase due to siderophore-As complex formation when siderophores were used to release As from ferrihydrite. In contrast, As was not detected in the aqueous phase when EDTA was used, probably due to the readsorption of released As to ferrihydrite. A series of pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of siderophores as a microbial iron-chelator on As uptake by Cretan brake fern (Pteris cretica L.) during phtoextraction. Results revealed that P. cretica, a known As hyperaccumulator, grown in the siderophore-amended soil showed about 3.7 times higher As uptake (5.62 mg-Asg(-1)-plant) than the plant grown in the EDTA-treated soil (1.51 mg-Asg(-1)-plant). In addition, As taken up by roots of P. cretica in the presence of siderophores seemed to be favorably translocated to shoots (i.e. stems and leaves). About 79% of the accumulated As was detected in the shoots in the presence of siderophores after ten weeks. Fluorescence microscopic analysis confirmed that As in the roots was delivered to the leaves of P. cretica as a siderophore-As complex."

A pilot study was conducted to determine the effects of Spirulina (<i>Arthrospira platensis</i>) on Cretan patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Spirulina is a filamentous cyanobacterium taken as a dietary supplement. Fifteen adult Cretan outpatients (13 men), median age 48 (range: 29-62) years, with NAFLD were orally supplemented with 6 g of Spirulina (Greek production) per day for six months. Anthropometric characteristics (height, weight, waist circumference), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, complete blood count, biochemical assessments, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, health-related quality of life and abdominal sonographic findings were recorded and measured, before and after Spirulina supplementation. At the end of the 6-month intervention period, the mean levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly decreased: 38.5%, 37.5%, 26.7%, 24.8%, 9.6%, 9.1%, and 13.5% respectively, whereas the mean levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and hemoglobin were significantly increased: 4.2% and 4.1% respectively. Spirulina supplementation resulted also in a significant reduction in weight and HOMA-IR index (8.1% and 19.6% respectively) and a significant improvement in health-related quality of life scale. No changes in sonographic findings were observed. Spirulina supplementation at a high dosage of 6 g daily in NAFLD patients has strong and multiple beneficial metabolic effects and improves their health-related quality of life.

Isolated populations are emerging as a powerful study design in the search for low-frequency and rare variant associations with complex phenotypes. Here we genotype 2,296 samples from two isolated Greek populations, the Pomak villages (HELIC-Pomak) in the North of Greece and the Mylopotamos villages (HELIC-MANOLIS) in Crete. We compare their genomic characteristics to the general Greek population and establish them as genetic isolates. In the MANOLIS cohort, we observe an enrichment of missense variants among the variants that have drifted up in frequency by more than fivefold. In the Pomak cohort, we find novel associations at variants on chr11p15.4 showing large allele frequency increases (from 0.2% in the general Greek population to 4.6% in the isolate) with haematological traits, for example, with mean corpuscular volume (rs7116019, P=2.3 × 10(-26)). We replicate this association in a second set of Pomak samples (combined P=2.0 × 10(-36)). We demonstrate significant power gains in detecting medical trait associations.

"The efficacy of protease inhibitor monotherapy has been analyzed with different endpoints: initial HIV-1 RNA rebound, long-term HIV-1 RNA suppression after re-intensification, treatment-emergent drug resistance, neurocognitive testing and HIV-1 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A PUBMED search identified nine randomised trials of PI monotherapy versus triple therapy in patients with HIV RNA&lt;50 copies/mL at baseline. RESULTS from the recently completed PROTEA trial were also included. The percentage of patients with HIV RNA suppression &lt;50 copies/mL was analyzed using switch equals failure and intensification included endpoints (ITT). The number of patients with new drug resistance mutations, HIV RNA in the CSF or change in neurocognitive function was analyzed by treatment arm. Four trials evaluated darunavir/r monotherapy (n=785: MONET, MONOI, MONARCH, PROTEA), five evaluated lopinavir/r monotherapy (n=592: OK-04, KalMo, KALESOLO, KRETA, MOST) and one evaluated both (MRC PIVOT, n=587). HIV-1 RNA suppression rates tended to be lower on PI monotherapy than triple therapy in ""switch equals failure"" analysis (76% vs 82%), but not when the outcome of intensification was included (87% vs 85%). There were small numbers of patients taking PI monotherapy with detectable HIV-1 RNA in the CSF, in three trials: PROTEA (n=2), MONOI (n=2) and MOST (n=5), but only two cases of CSF viral escape (MONOI). In two trials, there was no difference in neurocognitive test results between PI monotherapy and triple therapy, based on z-scores from five domains (in PROTEA, mean change in NPZ-5 score=0.0 for DRV/r monotherapy vs -0.10 for triple therapy); similar results were observed in the MRC PIVOT trial. The risk of treatment emergent NRTI or PI resistance (Table 1) was 11/973 (1.1%) for patients on PI monotherapy, versus 7/991 (0.7%) for patients on triple therapy. In 10 randomised trials of 1964 patients with HIV-1 RNA suppression at baseline, PI monotherapy showed a higher risk of HIV RNA elevations, and small numbers with HIV RNA detectable in CSF and concomitantly in the plasma. However there was no increased risk of treatment-emergent drug resistance, neurocognitive endpoints were not different between the arms and HIV-1 RNA suppression rates after intensification were similar between PI monotherapy and triple therapy."

Impaired postnatal growth after chloroform exposure in utero has been observed in rodents without an effect on birth weight. We aimed to study the relationship between exposure to trihalomethanes (THMs) during pregnancy and postnatal weight growth during infancy. We analysed 2216 mother-child pairs recruited in Gipuzkoa, Sabadell, Valencia (Spain, INMA Project, enrollment: 2003-2008) and Crete (Greece, RHEA Study, enrollment: 2007-2008). Drinking water habits and water-related activities ascertained through personal interviews were combined with THM measurements in drinking water to estimate THM exposure through different exposure routes during pregnancy. Weight measurements during the first year of life were used to fit postnatal weight growth curves from birth to one year and to predict weight at six months. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between six months weight gain and interquartile range (IQR) increase in THM exposure adjusting for confounders. Average weight gain at six months ranged from 4325 g (Gipuzkoa) to 4668 g (Crete). Median residential THM levels ranged from 1 μg/l (Crete) to 117 μg/l (Sabadell). No significant association was observed overall (-24.4 g [95% CI -78.8, 30.0] for an IQR increase in total residential uptake). A negative relationship was observed in Sabadell (-148 g [95% CI -282, -13.7]) for an IQR increase in ingestion THM uptake. No consistent evidence of an association between THM exposure during pregnancy and postnatal growth was observed. The novelty of the hypothesis and the negative trend observed in the region with the highest levels warrants the replication in future studies.

Mediterranean diet is a term used to describe the traditional eating habits of people in Crete, South Italy and other Mediterranean countries. It is a predominantly plant-based diet, with olive oil being the main type of added fat. There are many observational studies exploring the potential association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cognitive decline. The present review focuses on longitudinal studies with repeated cognitive assessments. It also evaluates evidence on behaviors related to the Mediterranean way of living, that have been shown to be associated with cognition, namely social interaction, participation in leisure activities, including physical activities, and sleep quality. The synergistic association-effect of these lifestyle behaviors, including diet, is unknown. Lifestyle patterns may constitute a new research and public health perspective.

"In Greece standard tests are performed in the watering and cooling systems of hotels' units either as part of the surveillance scheme or following human infection. The purpose of this study was to establish the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions of environmental Legionella isolates for six antimicrobials commonly used for the treatment of Legionella infections, by MIC-test methodology. Water samples were collected from 2004 to 2011 from 124 hotels from the four prefectures of Crete (Greece). Sixty-eight (68) Legionella isolates, comprising L. pneumophila serogroups 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, L. anisa, L. rubrilucens, L. maceachernii, L. quinlivanii, L. oakridgensis, and L. taurinensis, were included in the study. MIC-tests were performed on buffered charcoal yeast extract with α-ketoglutarate, L-cysteine, and ferric pyrophosphate. The MICs were read after 2 days of incubation at 36 ± 1 °C at 2.5% CO2. A large distribution in MICs was recorded for each species and each antibiotic tested. Rifampicin proved to be the most potent antibiotic regardless of the Legionella spp.; tetracycline appeared to have the least activity on our environmental isolates. The MIC-test approach is an easy, although not so cost-effective, way to determine MICs in Legionella spp. These data should be kept in mind especially since these Legionella species may cause human disease."

"This study investigated the attitudes toward lesbians and gay men among social work, psychology, medical, and nursing students in Crete, Greece, using Herek's ATLG scale. No respondents held completely heterosexist attitudes; only 1.6% held completely non-heterosexist attitudes. The 44.96 total ATLG score indicates a slightly positive attitude toward lesbians and gay men. Psychology students scored higher than all others on positive attitudes, followed by social work students, medical students, and nursing students. Gender, having lesbian or gay acquaintances or friends, and religiosity were significant factors influencing students' attitudes, while no impact on attitudes due to the effects of higher education could be discerned. Implications for curriculum design and teaching methods are discussed."

"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of trimester-specific gestational weight gain with offspring fetal growth, obesity risk, and cardiometabolic health outcomes from birth to 4 years of age. We conducted the present study with 977 mother-child pairs of the pregnancy cohort ""Rhea"" study in Crete, Greece. We measured birthweight, body mass index from 6 months to 4 years of age, waist circumference, skinfold thickness, blood pressure, and blood levels of lipids, C-reactive protein, and adipose tissue hormones at 4 years of age. We used multiple linear and log Poisson regression models to examine the association of exposure with continuous or binary outcomes, respectively. Greater rate of gestational weight gain in the first trimester of pregnancy (per 200 g/wk) was associated with increased risk of overweight/obesity from 2 years (relative risk [RR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.42) to 4 years of age (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05-1.25), but not with birth size. Each 200 g/wk of weight gain in the first trimester of pregnancy was also associated with greater risk of high waist circumference (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.23), high sum of skinfold thickness (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29), and higher diastolic blood pressure at 4 years of age (β, 0.43 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.00-0.86). Greater rate of gestational weight gain during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (per 200 g/wk) was associated with greater risk of large-for-gestational-age neonates (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.45) and higher levels of cord blood leptin (ratio of geometric means, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.17), but not with child anthropometry at later ages. Timing of gestational weight gain may influence childhood cardiometabolic outcomes differentially."

Insights from two long-term tillage experiments. 	The relationship between inorganic fertilization and soil aggregation is not well understood. We studied cumulative nitrogen (N) fertilization impacts on aggregation, soil organic C (SOC), pH, and their relationships under irrigated and rainfed experiments in Nebraska after 27 and 28 yr, respectively. The dominant soil series were Crete silt loam at the irrigated site, and Coleridge silty clay loam at the rainfed site. We studied irrigated continuous corn ( L.) in chisel plow (CP) and ridge till (RidgeT) receiving 0, 75, 150, and 300 kg N ha yr and rainfed continuous corn and corn-soybean [ (L.) Merr.] in moldboard plow (MP), reduced till (RT), and no-till (NT) with corn receiving 0, 80, and 160 kg N ha yr. Fertilization altered soil aggregation in all tillage systems under continuous corn. Mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates (MWDA) increased in the upper 7.5-cm depth in NT but decreased in the 7.5- to 60-cm depth by 1.5 times with N application. Fertilization reduced pH but had little or no effect on SOC. Both MWDA and pH ( = 0.47***) decreased under irrigated corn, particularly in the 7.5- to 30-cm depth. No-till and RT had two to five times greater near-surface MWDA than MP. Continuous corn had greater MWDA than corn-soybean in the upper 30-cm depth except in MP. Long-term N fertilization improves near-surface soil aggregation in NT continuous corn but reduces aggregation in the subsoil. Results also suggest that, if fertilizers are applied at rates of about 80 kg N ha, deterioration of soil aggregation would be minimal.

Observations from the island of Crete, Greece suggest that infusions of traditional Cretan aromatic plants, well known for their ethnopharmacological use in Eastern Mediterranean region and Near East, could be effective in the prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, including viral-induced infections. The aim of this study was to report the effectiveness of an essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants in the treatment of cases with an upper respiratory tract infection. A double blind randomized controlled trial was implemented between October 2013 and February 2014. An essential-oil extract of Cretan aromatic plants in olive oil (total volume of 15ml of essential oil per litre of olive oil) was administered as 0.5ml soft gel capsules, twice a day, for 7 days. Placebo treatment was 0.5ml olive oil in soft gel capsules. Eligible patients were those presenting for clinical examination in the selected setting with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection that had begun within the previous 24 hours. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of respiratory viruses. The primary outcome was the severity and duration of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, assessed using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory System Survey (WURSS-21) questionnaire. A secondary outcome of interest was the change in C-reactive protein (CRP) status. One hundred and five patients completed the study: 51 in the placebo group, and 54 in the intervention (treated) group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. No statistically significant differences were found in symptom duration or severity between the two groups, although small and clinically favorable effects were observed. When the analysis was restricted to subjects with a laboratory-documented viral infection, the percentage of patients with cessation of symptoms after 6 days of treatment was 91% in the intervention group and 70% in the control group (p=0.089). At baseline, one third of the patients in each group had elevated CRP levels. At follow-up, the respective proportions were 0% in the intervention group and 15% in the placebo group (p=0.121). The data were also in a favorable direction when 50% and 80% symptom reduction points were considered for specific virus types. Compared with placebo the essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants provided no detectable statistically significant benefit or harm in the patients with upper respiratory illness, although descriptive differences were identified in favorable direction mainly in the virus-positive population.

The purpose of this study was to create a modeling management tool for the simulation of extreme flow events under current and future climatic conditions. This tool is a combination of different components and can be applied in complex hydrogeological river basins, where frequent flood and drought phenomena occur. The first component is the statistical analysis of the available hydro-meteorological data. Specifically, principal components analysis was performed in order to quantify the importance of the hydro-meteorological parameters that affect the generation of extreme events. The second component is a prediction-forecasting artificial neural network (ANN) model that simulates, accurately and efficiently, river flow on an hourly basis. This model is based on a methodology that attempts to resolve a very difficult problem related to the accurate estimation of extreme flows. For this purpose, the available measurements (5 years of hourly data) were divided in two subsets: one for the dry and one for the wet periods of the hydrological year. This way, two ANNs were created, trained, tested and validated for a complex Mediterranean river basin in Crete, Greece. As part of the second management component a statistical downscaling tool was used for the creation of meteorological data according to the higher and lower emission climate change scenarios A2 and B1. These data are used as input in the ANN for the forecasting of river flow for the next two decades. The final component is the application of a meteorological index on the measured and forecasted precipitation and flow data, in order to assess the severity and duration of extreme events.

Twenty five years have passed since the first research efforts in Greece on human papillomavirus (HPV) performed by the Department of Clinical Virology at the University of Crete School of Medicine. HPV infection in the human cervix was initially evaluated in relation to the host mutational and transcriptional activation of the ras/raf genes pathway, p53 gene polymorphisms, neo-angiogenesis- related gene expression and G1/S phase transition. A series of epidemiological studies ensued, evaluating HPV infection in the ophthalmic pterygium, benign laryngeal tumors, parotid lesions, nasal polyposis, actinic keratosis, aborted material and non-genital cancers. The observed geographical variations of different HPV types within the Hellenic population indicated a higher prevalence of HPV 18 on the island of Crete compared to mainland Greece. Moreover, our research led to the investigation of the mother-to-infant HPV transmission via human breast milk and the detection of novel HPV types in juvenile recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. We also evaluated the presence of HPV in the respiratory tract of asymptomatic children and the relationship between maternal HPV infection and neonatal prematurity. Despite the introduction of the current prophylactic vaccines against HPV into clinical practice, HPV remains a challenging target for the next generation of researchers, as the war against HPV continues.

There has been a significant increase in overweight and obesity worldwide reaching global epidemic, with dramatic increase also among women of reproductive age or entering pregnancy. Aims of the study were to estimate the prevalence of maternal pregestational overweight and obesity and their association with and contribution to maternal obstetric complications and mode of delivery. One thousand two hundred eighty-six women with singleton pregnancies were followed-up prospectively from early pregnancy to delivery in Crete. The prevalence of pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity were 20 and 11.5%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, overweight and/or obesity were associated with an increased risk for caesarean deliveries [RR(overweight_vs._normal) BMI = 1.21, 95% CI (1.06, 1.38), RR(obese_vs._normal) BMI = 1.21, 95% CI (1.02, 1.42)], gestational diabetes mellitus [RR(obese_vs._normal) BMI = 2.11, 95% CI (1.28, 3.47)] and high blood pressure [RR(severy.obese_vs._normal) BMI = 3.32, 95% CI (1.36, 8.06)] any time in pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy excess weight has potentially contributed to 21% of planned caesarean deliveries in primiparae (almost 45% of such cases among overweight/obese primiparea were potentially attributed to pregestational excess weight). One-third of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes cases among overweight/obese mothers could be attributed to pregestational excess weight, although results did not reach statistical significance. Pregestational overweight and obesity continued to increase even more in recent years. Findings further support that maternal excess weight has a significant effect on and contribution to multiple maternal obstetric complications and the mode of delivery, underlining the necessity of obesity prevention, health policy strategies and health care that can result in significant individual and societal benefits.

Severe allergic reactions of unknown etiology,necessitating a hospital visit, have an important impact in the life of affected individuals and impose a major economic burden to societies. The prediction of clinically severe allergic reactions would be of great importance, but current attempts have been limited by the lack of a well-founded applicable methodology and the wide spatiotemporal distribution of allergic reactions. The valid prediction of severe allergies (and especially those needing hospital treatment) in a region, could alert health authorities and implicated individuals to take appropriate preemptive measures. In the present report we have collecterd visits for serious allergic reactions of unknown etiology from two major hospitals in the island of Crete, for two distinct time periods (validation and test sets). We have used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a satellite-based, freely available measurement, which is an indicator of live green vegetation at a given geographic area, and a set of meteorological data to develop a model capable of describing and predicting severe allergic reaction frequency. Our analysis has retained NDVI and temperature as accurate identifiers and predictors of increased hospital severe allergic reactions visits. Our approach may contribute towards the development of satellite-based modules, for the prediction of severe allergic reactions in specific, well-defined geographical areas. It could also probably be used for the prediction of other environment related diseases and conditions.

Pneumocystisjirovecii (former carinii) pneumonia, is a life-threatening opportunistic infection occurring in immunocompromised hosts. The aim of this study was to investigate the predisposing factors, clinical features and outcome of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in HIV-negative patients. The medical records of 62 adult patients with PCP, hospitalized at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece during a 10-year period (2004-2013) were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were immunosuppressed prior to the development of PCP. Thirty one patients (50%) suffered malignant hematological disease, 16 (26%) solid tumor and 15 (24%) had chronic inflammatory disease. Only 17 (27%) had received long-term systemic corticosteroids. All had symptoms of pneumonia upon admission, while 12 (19%) were suffering respiratory failure. Twenty one (34%) had received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis before the PCP onset. Eight patients (13%) were admitted to the ICU. Mortality attributable to PCP reached 29%. Mortality attributable to PCP was higher in patients with solid tumors. TMP-SMX prophylaxis failed in a significant portion of the present cohort. Hence, PCP should be included in the differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients with symptoms from the respiratory tract even if TMP-SMX has been given as prophylaxis.

Near-ground air (26 substances) and surface seawater (55 substances) concentrations of persistent toxic substances (PTS) were determined in July 2012 in a coordinated and coherent way around the Aegean Sea based on passive air (10 sites in 5 areas) and water (4 sites in 2 areas) sampling. The direction of air-sea exchange was determined for 18 PTS. Identical samplers were deployed at all sites and were analysed at one laboratory. hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) as well as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its degradation products are evenly distributed in the air of the whole region. Air concentrations of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) and o,p'-DDT and seawater concentrations of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD were elevated in Thermaikos Gulf, northwestern Aegean Sea. The polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener pattern in air is identical throughout the region, while polybrominated diphenylether (PBDE)patterns are obviously dissimilar between Greece and Turkey. Various pollutants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCBs, DDE, and penta- and hexachlorobenzene are found close to phase equilibrium or net-volatilisational (upward flux), similarly at a remote site (on Crete) and in the more polluted Thermaikos Gulf. The results suggest that effective passive air sampling volumes may not be representative across sites when PAHs significantly partitioning to the particulate phase are included.

Cancers have been the leading cause of death worldwide and the prevalence of obesity is also increasing in these few decades. Interestingly, there is a direct association between cancer and obesity. Each year, more than 90,000 cancer deaths are caused by obesity or overweight. The dietary pattern in Crete, referred as the traditional Mediterranean diet, is believed to confer Crete people the low mortality rates from cancers. Nevertheless, the antiobesity effect of the Mediterranean diet is less studied. Given the causal relationship between obesity and cancer, the antiobesity effect of traditional Mediterranean diet might contribute to its anticancer effects. In this regard, we will critically review the anticancer and antiobesity effects of this diet and its dietary factors. The possible mechanisms underlying these effects will also be discussed.

"To evaluate the association of second-hand smoke exposure of pregnant mothers using urine cotinine with the neurodevelopment of their children at 18 months of age in the mother-child cohort in Crete (Rhea Study). Selected participants were Greek mothers with singleton pregnancies, had never smoked, and had available urine cotinine measurements in pregnancy, and their children for whom a neurodevelopmental assessment was completed. We performed face-to-face interviews twice during pregnancy and postnatally, and assessed children's neurodevelopment at 18 months of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. We used linear regression and generalized additive models. Of 599 mothers, 175 (29%) met the inclusion criteria. Maternal urine cotinine levels were low (mean: 10.3 ng/mL, SD: 11.7 ng/mL). Reported passive smoking from different sources was strongly associated with urine cotinine levels. A negative association was observed between cotinine levels in pregnancy and child's gross motor function (beta = -3.22 per 10 ng/mL, 95% CI -5.09 to -1.34) after adjusting for factors potentially associated with neurodevelopment; results were similar in both sexes. A negative association was also observed for cognitive and receptive communication scales but the effect was small and not statistically significant. Maternal exposure during pregnancy to second-hand smoke measured through urine cotinine was associated with a decrease in gross motor function among 18-month-old children, even at low levels of exposure."

"Body size variation within clades of mammals is widespread, but the developmental and life-history mechanisms by which this variation is achieved are poorly understood, especially in extinct forms. An illustrative case study is that of the dwarfed morphotypes of Candiacervus from the Pleistocene of Crete versus the giant deer Megaloceros giganteus, both in a clade together with Dama dama among extant species. Histological analyses of long bones and teeth in a phylogenetic context have been shown to provide reliable estimates of growth and life history patterns in extant and extinct mammals. Similarity of bone tissue types across the eight species examined indicates a comparable mode of growth in deer, with long bones mainly possessing primary plexiform fibrolamellar bone. Low absolute growth rates characterize dwarf Candiacervus sp. II and C. ropalophorus compared to Megaloceros giganteus displaying high rates, whereas Dama dama is characterized by intermediate to low growth rates. The lowest recorded rates are those of the Miocene small stem cervid Procervulus praelucidus. Skeletal maturity estimates indicate late attainment in sampled Candiacervus and Procervulus praelucidus. Tooth cementum analysis of first molars of two senile Megaloceros giganteus specimens revealed ages of 16 and 19 years whereas two old dwarf Candiacervus specimens gave ages of 12 and 18 years. There is a rich histological record of growth across deer species recorded in long bones and teeth, which can be used to understand ontogenetic patterns within species and phylogenetic ones across species. Growth rates sensu Sander &amp; Tückmantel plotted against the anteroposterior bone diameter as a proxy for body mass indicate three groups: one with high growth rates including Megaloceros, Cervus, Alces, and Dama; an intermediate group with Capreolus and Muntiacus; and a group showing low growth rates, including dwarf Candiacervus and Procervulus. Dwarf Candiacervus, in an allometric context, show an extended lifespan compared to other deer of similar body size such as Mazama which has a maximum longevity of 12 years in the wild. Comparison with other clades of mammals reveals that changes in size and life history in evolution have occurred in parallel, with various modes of skeletal tissue modification."

Setting Rural practices in a well-defined geographical area of Crete. The questionnaire was addressed in all patients that visited the rural practices with chronic or acute diseases for two consecutive weeks. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Age, annual income, adherence to therapy, patient's views and feelings. 288 patients participated. The mean age was 68±6.87. The majority of the patients have lowered the doses of several medications by themselves as they weren't able to afford the cost ie; all patients receiving insulin had lowered the dosages; 46.42% of patients with COPD or asthma had stopped their medications completely, decreased dosages or used similar medications that had in the past; patients with dislipidemia received their medications as suggested only in 51.8%. Patients with cardiovascular diseases received their medications as suggested in 75.6% while the rest have dismissed or skipped dosages. Most common emotions reported were those of sadness, fear, stress, anxiety and isolation.

"Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may increase risk of obesity later in life. We examined the relation of in utero POPs exposure to offspring obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors at 4 years of age in the Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece (n = 689). We determined concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in first-trimester maternal serum. We measured child weight, height, waist circumference, skinfold thicknesses, blood pressure (BP), blood levels of lipids, C-reactive protein, and adipokines at 4 years of age. Childhood obesity was defined using age- and sex-specific cut points for body mass index (BMI) as recommended by the International Obesity Task Force. On multivariable regression analyses, a 10-fold increase in HCB was associated with a higher BMI z-score (adjusted β = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.86), obesity [relative risk (RR) = 8.14; 95% CI: 1.85, 35.81], abdominal obesity (RR = 3.49; 95% CI: 1.08, 11.28), greater sum of skinfold thickness (β = 7.71 mm; 95% CI: 2.04, 13.39), and higher systolic BP (β = 4.34 mmHg; 95% CI: 0.63, 8.05) at 4 years of age. Prenatal DDE exposure was associated with higher BMI z-score (β = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.5), abdominal obesity (RR = 3.76; 95% CI: 1.70, 8.30), and higher diastolic BP (β = 1.79 mmHg; 95% CI: 0.13, 3.46). PCBs were not significantly associated with offspring obesity or cardiometabolic risk factors. Prenatal exposure to DDE and HCB was associated with excess adiposity and higher blood pressure levels in early childhood."

The incidence of age-related cognitive decline is rising considerably around the world. There is evidence from a number of recent cross-sectional and prospective studies indicating positive associations between the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MedDiet) and improved cognitive outcomes among the elderly including, reduced age-related cognitive decline and enhanced age-related cognitive performance. However, to date no study has validated these associations in healthy older adult populations (≥65 years and above) with randomised evidence. The main aim of the present study is to provide justified evidence regarding the efficacy of a MedDiet approach to safely reduce the onset of cognitive decline, and promote optimal cognitive performance among healthy older adults using rigorous, randomised intervention methodology. MedLey is a 6-month, randomised controlled 2-cohort parallel group intervention trial, with initial assessment at baseline and repeated every three months. A sample of 166 healthy Australian men and women aged 65 years and above, with normal cognitive function and proficient in English language were recruited from metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia for the study. Participants randomly allocated to the experimental group are required to maintain an intervention dietary pattern based from the traditional Cretan MedDiet (i.e. vegetables, fruits, olive oil, legumes, fish, whole grain cereals, nuts and seeds and low consumption of processed foods, dairy products, red meat and vegetable oils) for six months, while those participants allocated to the control group are asked to maintain their customary lifestyle and diet. The primary outcome of interest is the quantitative difference in age-related cognitive performance, as measured by latent variables (cognitive constructs) sensitive to normal ageing and diet (i.e. speed of processing, memory, attention, executive functions, visual spatial and visuomotor ability). Secondary outcomes include change in biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, glucose, insulin, blood flow velocity, and psychological well-being factors (i.e. stress, sleep, anxiety, depression). To our knowledge this will be one of the first randomised clinical trials worldwide to provide evidence for the cause-effect relationship between the MedDiet and age-related cognitive function in a healthy older adult population (≥65 years and over).

Nowadays, there has been an increased interest in essential oils from various plant origins as potential antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiproliferative agents. This trend can be mainly attributed to the rising number and severity of food poisoning outbreaks worldwide along with the recent negative consumer perception against artificial food additives and the demand for novel functional foods with possible health benefits. Origanum dictamnus (dittany) is an aromatic, tender perennial plant that only grows wild on the mountainsides and gorges of the island of Crete in Greece. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiproliferative properties of O. dictamnus essential oil and its main components and assess its commercial potential in the food industry. O. dictamnus essential oil was initially analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine semi-quantitative chemical composition of the essential oils. Subsequently, the antimicrobial properties were assayed and the minimum inhibitory and non-inhibitory concentration values were determined. The antioxidant activity and cytotoxic action against the hepatoma adenocarcinoma cell line HepG2 of the essential oil and its main components were further evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, respectively. The main constituents of O. dictamnus essential oil identified by GC-MS analysis were carvacrol (52.2%), γ-terpinene (8.4%), p-cymene (6.1%), linalool (1.4%), and caryophyllene (1.3%). O. dictamnus essential oil and its main components were effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus niger. In addition, the estimated IC50 value for the DPPH radical scavenging activity for O. dictamnus essential oil was 0.045±0.0042% (v/v) and was mainly attributed to carvacrol. The EC50 value for the essential oil in the 72h SRB assay in HepG2 cells was estimated to be 0.0069±0.00014% (v/v). Among the individual constituents tested, carvacrol was the most bioactive compound and accounted for the observed antiproliferative activity of the essential oil. The results revealed that O. dictamnus essential oil is a noteworthy growth inhibitor against the microbes studied. It also possesses significant antioxidant activity and demonstrated excellent cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells. Taken together, O. dictamnus essential oil may represent an effective and inexpensive source of potent natural antimicrobial agents with health-promoting properties, which may be incorporated in food systems.

"Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity may increase the risk of childhood obesity but it is unknown whether other metabolic factors in early pregnancy such as lipid profile and hypertension are associated with offspring cardiometabolic traits. Our objective was to investigate whether fasting lipid, glucose, and insulin levels during early pregnancy and maternal pre-pregnancy weight status, are associated with offspring adiposity measures, lipid levels and blood pressure at preschool age. The study included 618 mother-child pairs of the pregnancy cohort ""Rhea"" study in Crete, Greece. Pregnant women were recruited at the first prenatal visit (mean: 12 weeks, SD: 0.7). A subset of 348 women provided fasting serum samples for glucose and lipid measurements. Outcomes measures were body mass index, abdominal circumference, sum of skinfold thickness, and blood pressure measurements at 4 years of age. A subsample of 525 children provided non-fasting blood samples for lipid measurements. Pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity was associated with greater risk of offspring overweight/obesity (RR: 1.83, 95%CI: 1.19, 2.81), central adiposity (RR: 1.97, 95%CI: 1.11, 3.49), and greater fat mass by 5.10 mm (95%CI: 2.49, 7.71) at 4 years of age. These associations were more pronounced in girls. An increase of 40 mg/dl in fasting serum cholesterol levels in early pregnancy was associated with greater skinfold thickness by 3.30 mm (95%CI: 1.41, 5.20) at 4 years of age after adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI and several other confounders. An increase of 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure in early pregnancy was associated with increased risk of offspring overweight/obesity (RR: 1.22, 95%CI: 1.03, 1.45), and greater skinfold thickness by 1.71 mm (95% CI: 0.57, 2.86) at 4 years of age. Metabolic dysregulation in early pregnancy may increase the risk of obesity at preschool age."

Vago-glossopharyngeal neuralgia is an unusual clinical syndrome characterized by paroxysms of sharp pain in the distribution of glossopharyngeal nerve. Rarely the condition is associated with arrhythmia and cardiac syncope, a phenomenon named vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia. Here we present two patients with glosopharyngeal neuralgia associated with repetitive episodes of syncope referred from their primary care physician to neurosurgery department of a general hospital in Crete, Greece. The patients were successfully treated with microvascular decompression. A literature review on pathogenesis, diagnosis and management is also performed. Surgeons as well as primary care physicians have to be aware of this rare condition in order to prevent associated life-threatening complications and improve patient's clinical status with accurate therapy.

"We studied the epidemiology and microbiology of Clostridium difficile and the characteristics of patients with C. difficile infection (CDI) in Crete in three groups of hospitalized patients with diarrhoea: group 1 [positive culture and positive toxin by enzyme immunoassay (EIA)]; group 2 (positive culture, negative toxin); group 3 (negative culture, negative toxin). Patients in group 1 were designated as those with definitive CDI (20 patients for whom data was available) and matched with cases in group 2 (40 patients) and group 3 (40 patients). C. difficile grew from 6% (263/4379) of stool specimens; 14·4% of these had positive EIA, of which 3% were resistant to metronidazole. Three isolates had decreased vancomycin susceptibility. Patients in groups 1 and 2 received more antibiotics (P = 0·03) and had more infectious episodes (P = 0·03) than patients in group 3 prior to diarrhoea. Antibiotic administration for C. difficile did not differ between groups 1 and 2. Mortality was similar in all three groups (10%, 12·5% and 5%, P = 0·49). CDI frequency was low in the University Hospital of Crete and isolates were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin."

"Forticulcita platana sp. n. and Forticulcita apiensis sp. n. are described from Mugil liza Valenciennes in Argentina, and from Mugil cephalus Linnaeus in Salt Springs, Florida, USA, respectively. Supplemental material relating to the hermaphroditic sac of Forticulcita gibsoni Blasco-Costa, Montero, Balbuena, Raga et Kostadinova, 2009 is provided from a specimen isolated from M. cephalus off Crete, Greece. Forticulcita platana can be distinguished from all species of Forticulcita Overstreet, 1982 except F. gibsoni, based on possessing small pads or gland cells along the hermaphroditic duct. It can be differentiated from that species in possessing a hermaphroditic sac that is one and a half to two times longer than wide rather than one that is approximately three times longer than wide, longer eggs (44-52 μm rather than 34-44 μm long) and a shorter post-testicular space (&lt; 45% of the body length). Forticulcita apiensis can be differentiated from the other species of Forticulcita in possessing a testis that is shorter than or equal to the pharynx rather than one that is longer than the pharynx. Xiha gen. n. is erected for Dicrogaster fastigatus Thatcher et Sparks, 1958 as Xiha fastigata (Thatcher et Sparks, 1958) comb. n., and we tentatively consider Dicrogaster fragilis Fernández Bargiela, 1987 to be Xiha fragilis (Fernández Bargiela, 1987) comb. n. The new genus fits within the concept of Forticulcitinae Blasco-Costa, Balbuena, Kostadinova et Olson, 2009 in having a vitellarium comprised of a single elongate to subspherical mass. Xiha can be differentiated from Forticulcita in having spines lining the hermaphroditic duct, or intromittent organ. A Bayesian inference analysis of partial 28S rDNA sequences of the two New World species of Forticulcita, Xiha fastigata and previously published haploporids places Xiha fastigata within the Forticulcitinae and sister to Forticulcita. Amended diagnoses for the subfamily and for Dicrogaster Looss, 1902 are provided."

The subgenus Transphlebotomus comprises sand fly species with distribution markedly restricted to the Mediterranean basin and suspected of Leishmania transmission. Only three species, Phlebotomus mascittii, Phlebotomus canaaniticus and Phlebotomus economidesi, have been described up to the present. Due to their similar morphology, proper identification remains difficult and relies mainly on molecular markers. We studied sand fly species of this subgenus from Crete and south-western coast of Anatolia. Based on the sequencing analysis of mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4, cytochrome oxidase I), two new Transphlebotomus species were identified and subsequently distinguished also by morphological characters: Phlebotomus anatolicus n. sp. and Phlebotomus killicki n. sp. Moreover, Ph. economidesi, previously only recorded from Cyprus, was found in Turkey sympatrically with these two new species. Based on the divergence time estimates, the first split has occurred in the subgenus Transphlebotomus ∼10 million years ago and the paleogeographic events took place around the Aegean and Mediterranean regions were suggested as the main drivers of the diversification of the subgenus. Our findings indicate that for Transphlebotomus species, morphological identification should be confirmed by molecular approaches, especially for investigations concerning their possible vectorial role in Leishmania transmission.

Carnosic acid (CA) is a phenolic diterpene with anti-tumour, anti-diabetic, antibacterial and neuroprotective properties that is produced by a number of species from several genera of the Lamiaceae family, including Salvia fruticosa (Cretan sage) and Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary). To elucidate CA biosynthesis, glandular trichome transcriptome data of S. fruticosa were mined for terpene synthase genes. Two putative diterpene synthase genes, namely SfCPS and SfKSL, showing similarities to copalyl diphosphate synthase and kaurene synthase-like genes, respectively, were isolated and functionally characterized. Recombinant expression in Escherichia coli followed by in vitro enzyme activity assays confirmed that SfCPS is a copalyl diphosphate synthase. Coupling of SfCPS with SfKSL, both in vitro and in yeast, resulted in the synthesis miltiradiene, as confirmed by 1D and 2D NMR analyses (1H, 13C, DEPT, COSY H-H, HMQC and HMBC). Coupled transient in vivo assays of SfCPS and SfKSL in Nicotiana benthamiana further confirmed production of miltiradiene in planta. To elucidate the subsequent biosynthetic step, RNA-Seq data of S. fruticosa and R. officinalis were searched for cytochrome P450 (CYP) encoding genes potentially involved in the synthesis of the first phenolic compound in the CA pathway, ferruginol. Three candidate genes were selected, SfFS, RoFS1 and RoFS2. Using yeast and N. benthamiana expression systems, all three where confirmed to be coding for ferruginol synthases, thus revealing the enzymatic activities responsible for the first three steps leading to CA in two Lamiaceae genera.

"Caesarean deliveries are on the increase in Greece and around the world. The objective of the present study was to assess the frequency of planned and emergency caesarean deliveries and their socio-demographic predictors in women with singleton pregnancies followed-up from early pregnancy to delivery. The mother-child cohort in Crete examines a population sample of pregnant women recruited during one year beginning in February 2007. A cohort of 1096 women, with singleton pregnancies, was included in the present analyses. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error variance were used. Overall, 48% of the women had a caesarean delivery, with a higher percentage observed in women having their first child (52%). Maternal age was a predictor for caesarean deliveries; type of hospital was associated with the risk for an emergency caesarean, whereas women with lower education were at an increased risk of having a planned caesarean delivery among primiparae. Prior caesarean delivery was by far the strongest predictor (RR=7.68, 95% CI 5.71, 10.33) for a subsequent one among multiparae. Caesarean deliveries are almost as frequent as vaginal births in the study population and even more frequent in first-time mothers. The study findings support that risk factors are indeed mode of delivery and parity status specific. As such, it is becoming clearer which groups of women, especially first-time mothers, need to be targeted in future research and interventions so as to understand better and achieve an appropriate caesarean delivery risk."

In this prospective comparative (contralateral) clinical study, patients with bilateral progressive keratoconus underwent CXL treatment. The corneal epithelium during CXL was removed using transepithelial phototherapeutic keratectomy (Cretan protocol). One eye of each patient was randomly instilled with an RGTA (Cacicol20) once a day (study group), whereas the fellow eye was instilled with artificial tears (control group). Patients were examined daily until complete reepithelialization. Postoperative examinations included slit-lamp biomicroscopy to assess the epithelial defect size and subjective evaluation of pain. The study enrolled 18 patients (36 eyes). The mean epithelial defect size for study and control groups was 19.6 ± 4.2 mm versus 21.5 ± 2.8 mm, respectively, at day 1 (P = 0.019) and 6.4 ± 3.4 mm versus 7.9 ± 4.3 mm, respectively, at day 2 (P = 0.014). At day 3 postoperatively, 61.1% of study eyes were fully reepithelialized, compared with 11.1% of control eyes (P = 0.002). RGTA (Cacicol20) instillation seems to result in faster corneal reepithelialization after CXL in this study. However, there was no significant effect in subjective pain/discomfort."

To assess oral cancer prevention and early detection curricula in Illinois associate-degree dental hygiene programmes and highlight global health applications. An email invitation was sent to each Illinois associate-degree granting dental hygiene programme's oral cancer contact to participate in a survey via a SurveyMonkey™ link to a 21-item questionnaire. Questions elicited background information on each programme and inquired about curriculum and methods used for teaching oral cancer prevention and early detection. Eight of the 12 (67%) programmes responded. Three (37.5%) reported having a specific oral cancer curriculum. Five (62.5%) require students to perform examinations for signs and symptoms of oral cancer at each clinic visit. Variations exist across the programmes in the number of patients each student sees annually and the number of oral cancer examinations each student performs before graduation. Seven programmes (87.5%) conduct early detection screening in community settings. All programmes included risk assessment associated with tobacco. All other risk factors measured were treated inconsistently. Significant differences in training and experience were reported across Illinois dental hygiene programmes. Training is neither standardized nor uniformly comprehensive. Students' preparation for delivering prevention and early detection services to their patients could be strengthened to ensure competence including reflection of risk factors and behaviours in a global context. Regular review of curricular guidelines and programme content would help dental hygienists meet the expectations of the Crete Declaration on Oral Cancer Prevention.

"The determination of dietary patterns in children examines the effects of the overall diet at early ages, instead of looking at individual foods or energy providing nutrients. The present analysis aims to identify the dietary patterns of preschool children and to examine their associations with multiple socio-economic and lifestyle characteristics. Dietary data were collected for 1081 children participating in the Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece. Diet was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and dietary patterns were identified with principal component analysis. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine factors associated with each dietary pattern. Three dietary patterns were identified explaining 45.8% of the total diet variation. The 'Mediterranean' pattern was based on pulses, olive oil, vegetables, fish and fruits; the 'Snacky' pattern included potatoes and other starchy roots, salty snacks, sugar products and eggs; the 'Western' pattern contained cereals, cheese, added lipids, beverages and meat. Preschool attendance and increased time spent with the mother (⩾2 h/day) were positively associated with the 'Mediterranean' pattern, whereas watching TV was inversely associated with this pattern. Lower parental education, maternal age and earlier introduction to solid foods were positively associated with the 'Snacky' pattern. Higher scores on the 'Western' type diet were associated with exposure to passive smoking and watching TV. No variation in energy providing nutrient intake was observed across tertiles of the identified dietary patterns. The results from this analysis indicate the important role of socio-demographic factors on children's dietary preferences in early age."

The water flow and the mass transport of agrochemicals in the unsaturated and saturated zone were simulated in the extended alluvial basin of Keritis river in Crete, Greece (a predominantly flat and most productive citrus growing area) using the hydrological model MIKE SHE. This model was set up based on information on land use, geology, soil structure, meteorological data, as well as groundwater level data from pumping wells. Additionally, field measurements of the soil moisture at six different locations from three soil depths (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 m) were used as targets to calibrate and validate the unsaturated flow model while for saturated condition, groundwater level data from three well locations were used. Following the modeling approach, the agrochemical mass transport simulation was performed as well, based on different application doses. After the successful calibration processes, the obtained 1D modeling results of soil moisture-pressure related to soil depth at different locations were used to design a proper and cost-effective irrigation programme (irrigation timing, frequency, application rates, etc.) for citrus orchards. The results of the present simulation showed a very good correlation with the field measurements. Based on these results, a proper irrigation plan can be designed at every site of the model domain reducing the water consumption up to 38% with respect to the common irrigation practices and ensuring the citrus water productivity. In addition, the effect of the proposed irrigation scheduling on citrus yield was investigated. Regarding the agrochemical concentration in the groundwater for all dose cases was below the maximum permissible limit. The only exception was for the highest dose in areas where the water table is high. Thus, this modeling approach could be used as a tool for appropriate water management in an agricultural area estimating at each time and location the availability of soil water, contributing to a cost-effective irrigation plan.

The present work aimed to investigate the genetic structure of 11 edible herbs grown in the wild of eastern Crete that are becoming vulnerable due to habitat destruction and unregulated harvesting. Thirty three populations (268 individuals) of Reichardia picroides, Scolymus hispanicus, Scandix pecten-veneris, Leontodon tuberosus, Cichorium spinosum, Sonchus asper ssp. glaucescens, Urospermum picroides, Prasium majus, Hypochoeris radicata, Centaurea raphanina ssp. raphanina and Anagallis arvensis were collected and identified from nine regions with distinct microclimate (Lassithi prefecture), and their genetic composition was studied by means of RAPD markers. A total of ten primers per population were used to detect genetic diversity and bootstrap analysis was conducted for clustering the samples. High levels of heterogeneity were revealed while the Analysis of Molecular Variance documented that variance was allocated mainly within populations and at a lesser extent among populations. Fst values among regions were moderate to high, suggesting partial population fragmentation. Bayesian structure analysis revealed fine genetic composition and substantial admixture between species present in different regions, although clustering was mainly geographically related. High altitude regions, with little residential and agricultural development (Kefala, Agrilos, Ziros and Tziritis), were the areas where high biodiversity was detected. On the other hand, coastal regions had lower biodiversity, probably due to degradation of their habitat.

A CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL STUDY IN PERITONEAL FLUIDS.	"The first cytological study examining the expression of P53, BCL2 and MIB 1 expressions in correlation with other clinicopathological parameters in ascitic fluids of patients with serous ovarian carcinomas. Fifty women 35-75 years old were diagnosed cytologically and confirmed histologically after operation in the University Hospital of Crete. All carcinomas were serous type and eight(8) of grade I, eighteen (18) of grade II and twenty two (22) of grade III. All carcinomas were staged according to the Figo criteria. Fifteen (15) were of Figo stage III and thirty five (35) were of Figo stage IV. For p53 and bcl-2, staining was evaluated on a semiquantitative scale depending on the number of cells showing positivity. For MIB1, the percentage of positive nuclei was calculated. Main outcome measure(s): The expression of P53, BCL2 and MIB 1 (Ki 67) correlated with tumor grade and Figo stages were estimated by chi-square (χ2). The expression of P53 and MIB1 were found to be statistically significant (p &lt; 0.005) correlated with Figo stage and tumor grade. A statistical significant correlation was also found between BCL2 expression and tumor Grade ( p &lt; 0.005) but not between BCL2 expression and Figo Stage. The study found a high expression of P53 (64%) and MIB1 (72%) and an expression of BCL2 (48%) in ascitic fluid of patients with ovarian carcinoma. A statistically significant correlation between P53 and MIB1 expression correlated with tumor grade and Figo stage (p &lt; 0.005) and a statistically significant correlation between BCL2 expression and tumor grade but no with the Figo stage was found (p &lt; 0.005). There was a positive correlation between P53 and MIB1. No significant association was found between P53 and BCL2 expression or MIB1 labeling index. Our data show significant differences in the expression of these markers in ovarian tumors and suggest a possible role for these tumor-associated genes as supplemental tools in prognosis and further definition of the biologic potential of these tumors."

The aim of the current study was to further this work by exploring potential links between psycho-social factors such as religiosity/spirituality and sense of coherence with depression. A total number of 220 subjects of the SPILI III cohort (1988-2012) attending a primary care setting in the town of Spili on rural Crete represented the target group. All participants underwent a standardized procedure. Validated questionnaires were used to evaluate sense of coherence, depression levels and religious and spiritual beliefs. A multiple linear regression analysis of the Beck Depression Inventory Scale (BDI) in relation to demographic characteristics, scores on the Royal Free Interview for Spiritual and Religious Beliefs scale (RFI-SRB) and Sense of Coherence scale (SOC) was performed. A significant inverse association was found between BDI and RFI-SRB scale (B-coef = -0.6999, p &lt; 0.001), as well as among BDI and SOC scale (B-coef = -0.556, p &lt; 0.001). The findings of the current observational study indicate that highly religious participants are less likely to score high in the depression scale. Furthermore, participants with high SOC scored significantly lower in the BDI scale. Further research is required in order to explore the potential effect of SOC and religiosity/spirituality on mental health."

Four species of talitrid amphipods (Orchestia montagui Audouin, 1826, Orchestia stephenseni Cecchini, 1928, Orchestia xylino sp. nov. and Talitrus saltator (Montagu, 1808)) are reported from a set of fragmented pocket beaches to the east of Heraklion on the north coast of Crete. Aside from a previous record of O. stephenseni these are the first records of talitrid amphipods from the island of Crete. 2) Along a coastal segment of only 4.36 km, characterised by habitat fragmentation and substrate patchiness, a clear correlation between talitrid species and beach type is indicated. Talitrus saltator occurs only on sandy beaches. Orchestia montagui and O. xylino occur on banquette beaches and O. montagui, O. stephenseni and O. xylino occur on mixed sand/gravel and cobble beaches. 3) The genus Orchestia is redefined and confined to 15 marine supralittoral species from eastern North America, islands in the North-eastern Atlantic, and western-Europe, including the Baltic and the Mediterranean Seas plus a perplexing group in New Zealand. 4) The new genus Cryptorchestia is described, based on nine terrestrial species previously included in the genus Orchestia and occurring in western Europe, the Mediterranean Sea and the Azores and Canary islands in the North-eastern Atlantic. 5) The new species Orchestia xylino sp. nov. is described. 6) An extensive bibliography for the species in this study is provided.

"To analyse the gluteal adipose-tissue fatty-acid profiles from Cretan cohort survivors of the Seven Countries Study (SCS) at 2010 and to compare them with those of survivors assessed in 2000, as well as with literature data on male Cretans at 1965. We analysed data concerning the gluteal adipose-tissue fatty acids (analysed by GC) from three studies. The island of Crete (rural areas and the city of Heraklion). Twenty-two of the 2010 SCS survivors aged 90 years and over; seventy-eight men aged 80 years of the 2000 SCS survivors; and 280 men assessed in 1965. In comparison to 1965 and 2000, the SCS survivors in 2010 had a higher amount of 18:1n-9 (P&lt;0·05) in their gluteal adipose tissue and a lower amount of PUFA (P&lt;0·05). On the other hand, a constant decrease in adipose-tissue 14:1n-5 and 16:1n-7 was recorded between 1965 and 2010 (P&lt;0·001), and between 2000 and 2010 (P&lt;0·05), while 18:2n-6 appeared to decrease between the 1965 and 2010 assessments (P&lt;0·001). Comparison with a 1965 representative Cretan sample and 2000 SCS survivors indicated an increased concentration of oleic acid (known for its protective role against mortality) and a decreased concentration of PUFA (known for their susceptibility to oxidation) in our surviving sample at 2010. These changes may reflect internal physiological processes due to diet change within these years and/or ageing."

Global urbanization is a major force that causes alteration and loss of natural habitats. Urban ecosystems are strongly affected by humans and there is a gradient of decreasing human influence from city centers to natural habitats. To study ecological changes along this continuum, researchers introduced the urban-rural gradient approach. The responses of centipedes to an urbanization gradient (urban-suburban-rural areas) were studied using pitfall traps in and near the city of Heraklion, in the island of Crete, Greece, from November 2010 to November 2011. Our results do not support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, in which suburban areas located in the transitional zone between urban and rural habitats failed to indicate significant increase in terms of species richness and diversity.

"Recently, there has been growing interest in analysis of the geographical variation between populations of different Phlebotomus spp. and American sand flies by comparing the sequences of various genes. However, little is known about the genetic structure of the genus Sergentomyia França &amp; Parrot. No study has been carried out on Sergentomyia minuta Rondani. Most authors recognize this as a species with a high degree of morphological polymorphism, and some suspect that there are two subspecies: Se. minuta minuta Rondani in Europe, having about 40 horizontal cibarial teeth (sticks aligned along a straight line in the cibarial cavity), and Se. minuta parroti Adler &amp; Theodor in North Africa, having about 70 cibarial teeth. Here we analyzed phylogeographic patterns using cytochrome b (Cytb) and cytochrome C oxidase I mtDNA for 29 populations from 10 countries: Algeria, Cyprus, France (continental and Corsica), Greece (continental and Crete), Malta, Montenegro, Morocco, Portugal (continental and Atlantic Savage Islands), Spain, and Tunisia. We analyzed intra- and interpopulation patterns of genetic diversity. Our results from Bayesian inference showed a complex genetic structure of Se. minuta with four haplogroups including many different haplotypes. One haplogroup includes all the specimens from North Africa. A second haplogroup includes a few specimens from the south of France, Spain, and one from Portugal. The third includes many specimens from southern France, all the specimens from Corsica, one from Spain, and all specimen from Portugal except one. A fourth branch includes specimens from the Balkans, Malta, Crete, Cyprus, and curiously some from the Atlantic Savage Islands; settlement of the latter population remains unexplained. However, our results suggest that the settlement of the Mediterranean basin could have occurred at the same time for Se. minuta and both Phlebotomus perniciosus Newstead and Phlebotomus ariasi Tonnoir. The spatial distribution of haplotypes was congruent with phylogenetic findings."

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether dysfunctional family functioning contributes to relapse over a two-year follow-up period in patients experiencing their first episode of psychosis (FEP) and chronic patients with psychosis. The sample consisted of 100 remitted patients (50 FEP and 50 chronic) diagnosed with schizophrenia (82%) or bipolar disorder with most recent episode manic severe with psychotic features (18%) recruited from the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, and their family caregivers. Family functioning was assessed in terms of cohesion and flexibility (FACES-IV), expressed emotion (FQ), family burden (FBS) and caregivers' psychological distress (GHQ-28). Relapse was defined as patient rehospitalisation due to acute psychotic exacerbation, while number, length, and type of hospitalisations were also evaluated. Dysfunctional family functioning in terms of cohesion and flexibility was not found to be a significant risk factor for relapse in psychosis. High expressed emotion, as indexed primarily by increased levels of criticism rather than emotional over-involvement, was associated with increased risk of relapse and shorter time to relapse (HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.98, p=0.043). Similarly, high levels of family burden were related to shorter time to relapse (HR=0.47, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.95, p=0.037), whereas there was no significant difference in survival curves based on caregivers' psychological distress. No significant interaction effect of illness chronicity was observed in the aforementioned associations. These findings highlight caregivers' criticism and burden of care as long-term predictors of the course of psychosis from the early stages of the illness and later on. In contrast, unbalanced levels of cohesion and flexibility in the family, as well as caregivers' high emotional over-involvement and psychological distress do not appear to be factors that contribute to patient relapse. Family psychoeducational interventions focusing at ameliorating caregivers' negativity toward the patient, and easing the burden of care should be considered as means in reducing relapse.

"	"Dictamnus was a popular name for a group of medicinal herbaceous plant species of the Rutaceae and Lamiaceae, which since the 4th century have been used for gynaecological problems and other illnesses BCE and still appear in numerous ethnobotanical records. This research has as four overarching aims: Determining the historical evolution of medical preparations labelled ""Dictamnus"" and the different factors affecting this long-standing herbal tradition. Deciphering and differentiating those medicinal uses of ""Dictamnus"" which strictly correspond to Dictamnus (Rutaceae), from those of Origanum dictamnus and other Lamiaceae species. Quantitatively assessing the dependence from herbal books, and pharmaceutical tradition, of modern Dictamnus ethnobotanical records. Determining whether differences between Western and Eastern Europe exist with regards to the Dictamnus albus uses in ethnopharmacology and ethnomedicine. An exhaustive review of herbals, classical pharmacopoeias, ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological literature was conducted. Systematic analysis of uses reported which were standardized according to International Classification of Diseases - 10 and multivariate analysis using factorial, hierarchical and neighbour joining methods was undertaken. The popular concept ""Dictamnus"" includes Origanum dictamnus L., Ballota pseudodictamnus (L.) Benth. and B. acetabulosa (L.) Benth. (Lamiaceae), as well as Dictamnus albus L. and D. hispanicus Webb ex Willk. (Rutaceae), with 86 different types of uses. Between 1000 and 1700 CE numerous complex preparations with ""Dictamnus"" were used in the treatment of 35 different pathologies. On biogeographical grounds the widespread D. albus is a far more likely prototypical ""Dictamnus"" than the Cretan endemic Origanum dictamnus. However both form integral parts of the ""Dictamnus"" complex. Evidence exists for a sufficiently long and coherent tradition for D. albus and D. hispanicus, use to treat 47 different categories of diseases. This approach is a model for understanding the cultural history of plants and their role as resources for health care. ""Dictamnus"" shows how transmission of traditional knowledge about materia medica, over 26 centuries, represents remarkable levels of development and innovation. All this lead us to call attention to D. albus and D. hispanicus which are highly promising as potential herbal drug leads. The next steps of research should be to systematically analyse phytochemical, pharmacological and clinical evidence and to develop safety, pharmacology and toxicology profiles of the traditional preparations."

The dominant uncertainties in assessing tsunami hazard in the Eastern Mediterranean are attached to the location of the sources. Reliable historical reports exist for five tsunamis associated with earthquakes at the Hellenic plate boundary, including two that caused widespread devastation. Because most of the relative motion across this boundary is aseismic, however, the modern record of seismicity provides little or no information about the faults that are likely to generate such earthquakes. Independent geological and geophysical observations of two large historical to prehistorical earthquakes, in Crete and Rhodes, lead to a coherent framework in which large to great earthquakes occurred not on the subduction boundary, but on reverse faults within the overlying crust. We apply this framework to the less complete evidence from the remainder of the Hellenic plate boundary zone, identifying candidate sources for future tsunamigenic earthquakes. Each such source poses a significant hazard to the North African coast of the Eastern Mediterranean. Because modern rates of seismicity are irrelevant to slip on the tsunamigenic faults, and because historical and geological data are too sparse, there is no reliable basis for a probabilistic assessment of this hazard, and a precautionary approach seems advisable.

"Marine sponge-associated actinomycetes are considered as promising sources for the discovery of novel biologically active compounds. In the present study, a total of 64 actinomycetes were isolated from 12 different marine sponge species that had been collected offshore the islands of Milos and Crete, Greece, eastern Mediterranean. The isolates were affiliated to 23 genera representing 8 different suborders based on nearly full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four putatively novel species belonging to genera Geodermatophilus, Microlunatus, Rhodococcus and Actinomycetospora were identified based on a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of &lt; 98.5% to currently described strains. Eight actinomycete isolates showed bioactivities against Trypanosma brucei brucei TC221 with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values &lt;20 μg/mL. Thirty four isolates from the Milos collection and 12 isolates from the Crete collection were subjected to metabolomic analysis using high resolution LC-MS and NMR for dereplication purposes. Two isolates belonging to the genera Streptomyces (SBT348) and Micromonospora (SBT687) were prioritized based on their distinct chemistry profiles as well as their anti-trypanosomal activities. These findings demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of utilizing metabolomics tools to prioritize chemically unique strains from microorganism collections and further highlight sponges as rich source for novel and bioactive actinomycetes."

Mature spores are elliptical, with mean dimensions 11.2 ± 0.5 × 7.8 ± 0.1 μm and possess spherical polar capsules with mean diameter of 2.3 ± 0.3 μm. The new species is differentiated from other similar species of the genus based on spore morphology, its coelozoic life-style and molecular data. The phylogenetic tree constructed using maximum likelihood analysis of small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequence data complements the characterisation of Zschokkella candia n. sp. by defining its phylogenetic position among the species of Zschokkella Auerbach, 1909 sequenced to date. The phylogenetic analysis supports the existing knowledge on the complicated polyphyletic relationships among the members of the genus Zschokkella.

Sex in the adult skeleton can usually be reliably determined through an assessment of features found on the pelvis and cranium. In the lack of these elements it is necessary to elaborate other methods to establish sex in skeletonised remains recovered in forensic cases. Standards for other bones (e.g. humerus, metacarpals and metatarsals) have already been established for the Greek population. The aim of this study is to determine whether the standards for metacarpals provided from a study on the Athens collection are representative of a modern Cretan population. Using a digital caliper we took 7 measurements on each one of the left and right metacarpal bones of 108 adult individuals from a modern collection from Crete. Totally twenty formulae for left and right bones created from the Athens collection were used to sex the sample of this study. The overall classification accuracy obtained for our sample was very close to the cross-validated accuracy reported by the authors. However, looking at the classification accuracy for males and females, a consistent trend for low classification rates in females was observed. New formulae were developed for the Cretan sample yielding up to 85% classification accuracy. This study clearly indicates that the standards for metacarpals developed from the Athens collection are not appropriate for application in forensic cases for the island of Crete as they do not represent the local population efficiently. This may hold true for other regions of Greece thus great caution should be taken when applying these standards. Obviously more research is needed to confirm these results.

"Micronuclei (MN) are biomarkers of early genetic effects that have been used to investigate the association between environmental exposures and cancer. However, few studies have examined the association between environmental exposures during pregnancy and MN in mothers and newborns. We examined MN frequency in maternal blood and in cord blood, in relation to maternal air pollution exposure, and the potential interaction with maternal vitamin C intake and maternal smoking. We used the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay to assess MN frequency per 1000 bi-nucleated T-lymphocytes from 181 mothers and 183 newborns born in 2007-2008 in Heraklion (Crete, Greece). The ESCAPE land-use regression methods were used to estimate annual mean exposure to outdoor air pollution [particulate matter (PM), black carbon, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)] at maternal home addresses. Food frequency questionnaires were used to estimate maternal dietary vitamin C intake during pregnancy. Smoking habits were self-reported using questionnaires which were checked by measuring maternal urinary cotinine levels. Exposure to PM2.5 was associated with increased MN frequencies in pregnant women [rate ratio [RR (95%CI)] per 5 µg/m(3)=1.53 (1.02, 2.29)]. This increase was considerably higher among women who did not fulfill the recommended vitamin C dietary allowances [RR=9.35 (2.77, 31.61); n=20]. Exposure to PM2.5-10, PM10, NO2 and NOx were also associated with a higher incidence of MN frequencies in smoker women (n=56). No associations were found for newborns. We found an association between air pollution, particularly PM2.5, and MN frequency in mothers but not in newborns. This association was more pronounced among women with a lower dietary intake of vitamin C during pregnancy and among women who smoked during pregnancy. While results are clear in mothers, the association between maternal carcinogenic exposures during pregnancy and biomarkers of early biologic effect in the newborn remains poorly understood."

"Bemisia tabaci is one of the most damaging agricultural pests world-wide. Although its control is based on insecticides, B. tabaci has developed resistance against almost all classes of insecticides, including neonicotinoids. We employed an RNA-seq approach to generate genome wide expression data and identify genes associated with neonicotinoid resistance in Mediterranean (MED) B. tabaci (Q1 biotype). Twelve libraries from insecticide resistant and susceptible whitefly populations were sequenced on an Illumina Next-generation sequencing platform, and genomic sequence information of approximately 73 Gbp was generated. A reference transcriptome was built by de novo assembly and functionally annotated. A total of 146 P450s, 18 GSTs and 23 CCEs enzymes (unigenes) potentially involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics were identified, along with 78 contigs encoding putative target proteins of six different insecticide classes. Ten unigenes encoding nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (nAChR), the target of neoinicotinoids, were identified and phylogenetically classified. No nAChR polymorphism potentially related with the resistant phenotypes, was observed among the studied strains. DE analysis revealed that among the 550 differentially (logFC &gt; 1) over-transcribed unigenes, 52 detoxification enzymes were over expressed including unigenes with orthologues in P450s, GSTs, CCE and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. Eight P450 unigenes belonging to clades CYP2, CYP3 and CYP4 were highly up-regulated (logFC &gt; 2) including CYP6CM1, a gene already known to confer imidacloprid resistance in B. tabaci. Using quantitative qPCRs, a larger screening of field MED B. tabaci from Crete with known neonicotinoid phenotype was performed to associate expression levels of P450s with resistance levels. Expression levels of five P450s, including CYP6CM1, were found associated with neonicotinoid resistance. However, a significant correlation was found only in CYP303 and CYP6CX3, with imidacloprid and acetamiprid respectively. Our work has generated new toxicological data and genomic resources which will significantly enrich the available dataset and substantially facilitate the molecular studies in MED B. tabaci. No evidence of target site neonicotinoid resistance has been found. Eight P450 unigenes, including CYP6CM1, were found significantly over-expressed in resistant B. tabaci. This study suggests at least two novel P450s (CYP303 and CYP6CX3) as candidates for their functional characterization as detoxification mechanisms of neonicotinoid resistance in B. tabaci."

Despite the evidence that Mediterranean Europe offers suitable conditions for the biology of felid respiratory metastrongyloids, no updated data on the presence of felid lungworms are available for Greece. Although the cat lungworm Aelurostrongylus abstrusus is considered as enzootic in domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) living in some areas of continental Greece, conversely, Troglostrongylus brevior, has only been reported in the island of Crete. The present study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior in domestic cats from four different Greek locations including islands where European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris), believed to be the natural reservoir of T. brevior, are considered absent. Faeces were collected from 125 stray cats in the city of Athens, and in Crete, Mykonos and Skopelos Islands, and examined by copromicroscopic techniques for the presence of lungworm larvae. When present, larvae were morphologically and molecularly identified. The occurrence of A. abstrusus and T. brevior was confirmed in 10 (8 %) and 7 (5.6 %) of the samples, respectively. In particular, T. brevior was detected in domestic cats in the city of Athens, and in Mykonos and Skopelos Islands, where wildcats are not present. This information illustrates that T. brevior may infect domestic cats regardless of the presence of the natural host. Considering the relevant clinical impact of this nematode especially in young animals, it is advisable to include troglostrongylosis in the differential diagnosis of cat respiratory diseases also where this parasite is unexpected.

NMR metabolomics was used to investigate 57 Greek spirits of four indigenous and four international varieties from Macedonia (tsipouro) and Crete (tsikoudia) to establish their authenticity. The metabolic profile of Romeiko, Malvasia, Xinomavro, Sangiovese and Nebbiolo varieties was assessed for the first time. The WET1D sequence was used to improve sensitivity and unveil minor metabolites. PCA was applied to delineate the provenance of samples and associate metabolites with distinct varietal characteristics, such as the acidity of Sangiovese, the overripe grapes harvesting of Romeiko, the intense body of Cabernet Sauvignon, the light body of Xinomavro and the glutamic acid for Malvasia. The migration of Cabernet Sauvignon from north Greece to Crete was framed. Monitoring multi-varietal spirits introduced 2-vinylethanol as a marker for yeast selection. OPLS-DA was applied to samples from the same vineyard, thus highlighting genotypic markers. Consequently, the findings address the concepts of typicity and traceability in grape marc spirits.

A possible role of pesticides. 	"Geoepidemiological data of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking. Crete has a genetically homogeneous population and is suitable for studies to identify a possible contribution of environmental factors in HCC. Databases for HCC (316 cases), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (633) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (392), constructed over the past 20 years in our Unit, were used. Data included place of birth and place of residence for the last 15 years. Hellenic Statistical Authority provided population statistics from 1980 to 2014. Time-spatial methods were applied in Gis-ArcMap 10 software. Spatial autocorrelation tests (Moran's index) detected differences between the spatial distribution to place of residence. Spatial density maps were created. Kriging Interpolation was applied, to produce prediction maps of HCC. Hepatitis C virus appears in areas of high prevalence while HBV is uniformly distributed. HCC is more prevalent in Eastern Crete. A spatial autocorrelation between HCC and either HCV (Moran's I = 0.88, P &lt; 0.001) or HBV (I = 0.84, P &lt; 0.02) was found as expected. However, there is a discrepancy in the South East of Crete, where a higher prevalence of HCC than expected was observed.

The genus Phlomis is represented in the island of Crete (Greece, Eastern Mediterranean) by three species Phlomis cretica C. Presl., Phlomis fruticosa L., the island endemic Phlomis lanata Willd. and three hybrids Phlomis x cytherea Rech.f. (P. cretica x P. fruticosa), Phlomis x commixta Rech.f. (P. cretica x P. lanata) and Phlomis x sieberi Vierh. (P. fruticosa x P. lanata). This work describes (a) the profile of hybrids and parental species concerning their volatile compounds, (b) the suitability of ribosomal nuclear (ITS region), chloroplast (trnH-psbA), and AFLP markers to identify hybrids and (c) their competence to characterize the different chemotypes of both hybrids and their parental species. The cluster analysis and PCA constructed from chemical data (volatile oils) suggest that there are three groups of taxa. Group IA includes P. cretica and P. fruticosa, group IB includes P. x cytherea, whereas group II consists of P. x commixta, P. x sieberi and P. lanata. Volatile compounds detected only in the hybrids P. x sieberi and P. x commixta correspond to the 3% of the total compounds, value that is much higher in P. x cytherea (21%). Neighbor-joining, statistical parsimony analysis and the observations drawn from ribotypes spectrum of ITS markers divided Phlomis species in two groups, P. lanata and the complex P. cretica/P. fruticosa. In contrast to the ITS region, the plastid DNA marker follows a geographically related pattern. Neighbor-Net, PCA and Bayesian assignment analysis performed for AFLP markers separated the genotypes into three groups corresponding to populations of P. cretica, P. fruticosa, and P. lanata, respectively, while populations of P. x commixta, P. x cytherea, and P. x sieberi presented admixed ancestry. Most of the P. x cytherea samples were identified as F1 hybrids by Bayesian assignment test, while those of P. x commixta and P. x sieberi were identified as F2 hybrids. Overall, high chemical differentiation is revealed in one of the three hybrids, which is likely related with niche variation. Moreover, molecular markers show potential to identify Phlomis taxa.

"The growth rates of planktonic microbes in the pelagic zone of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea are nutrient limited, but the type of limitation is still uncertain. During this study, we investigated the occurrence of N and P limitation among different groups of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic (pico-, nano-, and micro-) plankton using a microcosm experiment during stratified water column conditions in the Cretan Sea (Eastern Mediterranean). Microcosms were enriched with N and P (either solely or simultaneously), and the PO4 turnover time, prokaryotic heterotrophic activity, primary production, and the abundance of the different microbial components were measured. Flow cytometric and molecular fingerprint analyses showed that different heterotrophic prokaryotic groups were limited by different nutrients; total heterotrophic prokaryotic growth was limited by P, but only when both N and P were added, changes in community structure and cell size were detected. Phytoplankton were N and P co-limited, with autotrophic pico-eukaryotes being the exception as they increased even when only P was added after a 2-day time lag. The populations of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus were highly competitive with each other; Prochlorococcus abundance increased during the first 2 days of P addition but kept increasing only when both N and P were added, whereas Synechococcus exhibited higher pigment content and increased in abundance 3 days after simultaneous N and P additions. Dinoflagellates also showed opportunistic behavior at simultaneous N and P additions, in contrast to diatoms and coccolithophores, which diminished in all incubations. High DNA content viruses, selective grazing, and the exhaustion of N sources probably controlled the populations of diatoms and coccolithophores."

"Placenta creta is characterized by invasion of placental villi into the myometrium in the setting of a dysfunctional or absent decidua. Histopathologic diagnosis of placenta creta is important, particularly in cases of hysterectomy because of unanticipated intractable postpartum hemorrhage. Previous studies have documented a higher amount and depth of myometrial infiltration by the implantation site intermediate trophoblast compared with controls. In addition, we have anecdotally observed chorionic villi in myometrial vascular spaces in specimens with placenta creta. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence and specificity of these features. Sixty-one postpartum hysterectomies, 44 with placenta creta and 17 without were reviewed. Villous intrusion into vascular spaces was recorded. Using immunohistochemistry for GATA3, the amount of intermediate trophoblast (number of positive cells in five 40× fields) and depth of trophoblast myometrial infiltration were assessed. Mean gestational ages of the creta group (34.4 yr; range, 20-43 yr) and control group (35 yr; range, 25-51 yr) were comparable. Presence of chorionic villi in myometrial vascular spaces was frequent in placenta creta: 31/44 versus 1/17 controls (70.4% vs. 5.8%, P&lt;0.0001). This finding was more common in the percreta (87.5%) and increta (84%) than in the accreta (27.2%, P=0.0008). Mean depth of trophoblast myometrial invasion was greater in cretas (47.9%) than in controls (14.5%, P=0.004). Likewise, mean distance of deepest trophoblast to serosa was shorter in the cretas (7.3 mm) than in controls (23.8 mm, P&lt;0.0001). These differences were, however, attributable to placentas increta and percreta. When only accretas and controls were compared, the myometrial depth of trophoblast was similar. The mean intermediate trophoblast cell count in the placental bed was greater in cretas (664) than in controls (288, P&lt;0.0001). Such difference was seen in all creta cases despite the type (accreta 639, increta 676, percreta 661). A trophoblast count of ≥100 cells/high-power field was seen in 75.8% of cretas and 11.1% of controls (P=0.0009). For the first time, we document the finding of chorionic villi intrusion into myometrial vascular spaces, which is highly specific of placenta creta. In addition, assessment of the amount of intermediate trophoblast using GATA3 immunohistochemistry can assist in the diagnosis. We hypothesize that placental invasion in placenta creta is due, at least partially, to transformation of low-resistance myometrial vessels leading to subsequent protrusion of villi into their lumens, in the context of absent decidua."

"The aim of this study was to investigate vitamin D status by measuring serum 25(OH)D levels in euthyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) who lived and worked on the sunny island of Crete, Greece, and to evaluate whether vitamin D3 supplementation is beneficial for the management of HT patients with vitamin D deficiency. We studied 218 HT patients, euthyroid Caucasian Cretan Greek citizens: 180 females and 38 males. Among these patients, 186 (85.3%) had vitamin D deficiency defined as serum 25(OH)D levels &lt; 30 ng/mL. The mean age of all these 218 HT patients was 35.3 ± 8.5 years. The mean age of the 186 vitamin D deficient HT patients (173 females and 13 males) was 37.3 ± 5.6 years. The 186 vitamin D deficient HT patients received vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, CF) orally, 1200-4000 IU, every day for 4 months aiming to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels ≥ 40 ng/mL. Anthropometric characteristics (height, weight, waist circumference), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum concentration of 25(OH)D, thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO), antithyroglobulin (anti-TG), calcium and phosphorus levels and thyroid and kidney sonographic findings were recorded and measured before and after CF administration. There was a significant negative correlation only between serum 25(OH)D levels and anti-TPO levels among all 218 HT patients. Also, anti-TPO levels were significantly higher in 186/218 vitamin D deficient HT patients compared to 32/218 HT patients with no vitamin D deficiency (364 ± 181IU/mL versus 115.8 ± 37.1IU/mL, P&lt;0.0001). Supplementation of CF in 186 vitamin D deficient HT patients caused a significant decrease (20.3%) in serum anti-TPO levels. Although at the end of the 4 months period of the study body mass index (BMI), serum anti-TG and TSH levels decreased by 2.2%, 5.3% and 4% respectively, these differences were not significant. No changes in the sonographic findings were observed. The majority (85.3%) of the Greek Caucasian patients with HT studied who lived and worked in Crete had low serum 25(OH)D levels inversely correlated with serum anti-TPO thyroid antibodies. After 4 months of CF supplementation in the 186 HT patients with vitamin D deficiency, a significant decrease (20.3%) of serum anti-TPO levels was found. These findings suggest that vitamin D deficiency may be related to pathogenesis of HT and that its supplementation could contribute to the treatment of patients with HT."

"Phthalate esters (PEs), bisphenol A (BPA), and parabens (PBs), which are used in numerous consumer products, are known for their endocrine disrupting properties. Organophosphate chemicals (OPs), which form the basis of the majority of pesticides, are known for their neurotoxic activity in humans. All of these chemicals are associated with health problems to which children are more susceptible. Once they enter the human body, PEs, BPA, PBs, and OPs are metabolized and/or conjugated and finally excreted via urine. Hence, human exposure to these substances is examined through a determination of the urinary concentrations of their metabolites. This study assessed the exposure of Greek preschool-age children to PEs, BPA, PBs, and OPs by investigating the urinary levels of seven PEs metabolites, six PBs, BPA, and six dialkyl phosphate metabolites in five-hundred samples collected from 4-year-old children, subjects of the ""RHEA"" mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece. Daily intake of endocrine disruptors, calculated for 4 year old children, was lower than the corresponding daily intake for 2.5 year old children, which were determined in an earlier study of the same cohort. In some cases the daily intake levels exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) values and the EFSA Reference Doses (RfD) (e.g., for di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate, 3.6% and 1% of the children exceeded RfD and TDi, respectively). Exposure was linked to three main sources: PEs-BPA to plastic, PBs-diethyl phthalate to personal hygiene products, and OPs to food."

"The Island of Crete was the place where the use of herbal medicine has its roots since the Bronze Age period. Although, the consumption of aromatic plants as component in curing common diseases is still on population's practices, a new interest was appeared on the basis of studies with a focus on illness behavior as a mutual collaboration between the University of Crete and the University of Leiden, The Netherlands. The antioxidant activity of certain Cretan plants has been documented and it has been shown and reported that herbal extracts are possible to decrease lipid per oxidation in cultured lung cells exposed to iron or ozon. The biological effects and bioactivity of essential oils as well as their antibacterial properties have been previously discussed in the literature. However, it was the first attempt in Europe when a double blind randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of an essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants (Origanum Dictamnus, Coridothymus Capitatus, Salvia Friticosa) designed and implemented in rural Crete on patients with upper respiratory tract infection. Descriptive differences were recently reported in favorable direction especially in the virus-positive population, while these results guide at the moment a series of actions for further research and discussion on the potentialities in the therapeutic medicine. An over-the-counter drug under the name of ""Cretan Iama"" and as soft-gel capsules has recently circulated in Greece by the Olvos Science SA. A recent joint attempt (Clinic of Social and Family Medicine and Department of Experimental Endocrinology at the School of Medicine, University of Crete) under the support of the National Strategic Reference Framework Program focused on the effectiveness of functional extract of Mentha Spicata encapsulated in yogurt with honey on lipids profile of health patients in rural Crete. The first reported results of a cross-over study which was designed and implemented recently were in a favorite direction and it was in agreement with the animal based study that was carried out in the frame of this project. In conclusion, the two first studies on the Cretan medicinal and aromatic plants support the potentialities of the use of Ethno botanical methodology to move the needle of innovation on viral infections and lipids metabolism.

This is the first report of Bactra bactrana (Kennel, 1901) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) attacking a major solanaceous crop, sweet pepper Capsicum annuum L. The infestation was detected in two greenhouses at the area of Tympaki (Southern Crete, Greece). The moth larvae caused typical symptoms of a fruit borer with numerous small holes on the surface of the peppers and extensive damage on the inside of the fruit as a result of the feeding activity. Unknown factors facilitated this major shift in host range since B. bactrana is typically a stem borer of sedges. In addition, the pest status of B. bactrana is currently under question, as in both cases the infestations by the moth were associated with significant yield losses. B. bactrana was moderately controlled with chemicals registered for Lepidoptera management in sweet pepper due to the boring nature of the infestation. Some comparative taxonomic notes are provided to facilitate accurate pest discrimination of related Bactra species. Finally, biological attributes of the species are summarized and are discussed from pest control and ecological perspectives. Because Bactra species have been used in augmentative releases for the control of sage, the implications of our findings on the release of biocontrol agents are placed in perspective.

There is some evidence that aberrant eating behaviours and obesity co-occur with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. The present study is the first that aims to investigate the association between eating behaviours and ADHD symptoms in early childhood in a population-based cohort. We included 471 preschool children from the Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece. Parents completed the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire to assess children's eating behaviour and the 36-item ADHD test (ADHDT) to evaluate ADHD symptoms at 4 years of age. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association of eating behaviours with ADHD symptoms. Regarding children's food approach eating behaviours, we observed a positive association between food responsiveness and total ADHD index, as well as impulsivity, inattention and hyperactivity subscale, separately. Similarly, there was a significant positive association between emotional overeating and ADHD symptoms. With regard to children's food avoidant behaviours, food fussiness was found to be significantly associated with the impulsivity subscale. A dose-response association between the food approach behaviours and ADHD symptoms was also observed. Children on the medium and highest tertile of the food responsiveness subscale had increased scores on the ADHD total scale, as compared to those on the lowest tertile. As regards emotional overeating, children in the highest tertile of the scale had higher scores on ADHD total and hyperactivity. Our findings provide evidence that food approach eating behaviours such as food responsiveness and emotional overeating are associated with the increased ADHD symptoms in preschool children. Future studies to better understand this overlap will enhance potential interventions.

"Mercury (Hg) contamination testing was conducted on winter-caught male spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) in southern New England and results compared to available data on Hg concentrations for this species. A limited risk-reward assessment for EPA (eicosapentanoic acid) and DHA (docosahexanoic acid) lipid concentrations of spiny dogfish was completed in comparison with other commonly consumed marine fish. Mean Hg concentrations were 0.19 ppm (±0.30) wet weight. In comparison, mean Hg concentrations in S. acanthias varied geographically ranging from 0.05 ppm (Celtic Sea) to 2.07 ppm (Crete, Mediterranean Sea). A risk-reward assessment for Hg and DHA+EPA placed S. acanthias in both ""low-risk, high-reward"" and ""high-risk, high-reward"" categories for consumption dependent on locations of the catch. Our results are limited and are not intended as consumption advisories but serve to illustrate the need for making more nuanced, geo-specific, consumption guidance for spiny dogfish that is inclusive of seafood traceability and nutritional benefits."

"The aim of this analysis was to review the evidence and update a meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety results from randomized controlled trials of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) monotherapy. A PubMed/EMBASE search was conducted to find randomized trials of PI/r monotherapy vs. triple therapy in patients with HIV-1 RNA suppression at baseline (&lt;50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL). Rates of virological suppression were analysed using switch-equals-failure and intensification-included endpoints [intent-to-treat (ITT)]. The rate of treatment-emergent resistance mutations, neurocognitive function endpoints, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HIV-1 RNA were also analysed by treatment arm. There were 2303 patients from 13 different randomized clinical trials of darunavir/r monotherapy (n = 784: MONET, MONOI, Monarch and PROTEA), lopinavir/r monotherapy (n = 829: OK pilot, OK-04, KalMo, KALESOLO, KRETA, MOST and DREAM), atazanavir/r monotherapy (n = 103: MODAT), or all three (n = 587: PIVOT). HIV-1 RNA plasma suppression was lower in the PI/r monotherapy arm compared with the triple therapy arm in the switch-equals-failure analysis [difference -8.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -11.9 to -4.8%], but not when intensification was included (difference 0.5%; 95% CI -2.5 to 3.6%). Rates of resistance mutations were similar between arms, as was overall neurocognitive function. PI/r monotherapy showed a higher risk of plasma HIV-1 RNA elevations. However, there was no increased risk of treatment-emergent drug resistance, neurocognitive endpoints did not differ, and HIV-1 RNA suppression rates after intensification were similar between PI/r monotherapy and triple therapy."
PMID:26743330	Silva JF, Serakides R	Cell Adh Migr. 10(1-2):88-110	2016	Intrauterine trophoblast migration: A comparative view of humans and rodents. 	Trophoblast migration and invasion through the decidua and maternal uterine spiral arteries are crucial events in placentation. During this process, invasive trophoblast replace vascular endothelial cells as the uterine arteries are remodeled to form more permissive vessels that facilitate adequate blood flow to the growing fetus. Placentation failures resulting from either extensive or shallow trophoblastic invasion can cause pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, placenta creta, gestational trophoblastic disease and even maternal or fetal death. Consequently, the use of experimental animal models such as rats and mice has led to great progress in recent years with regards to the identification of mechanisms and factors that control trophoblast migration kinetics. This review aims to perform a comparative analysis of placentation and the mechanisms and factors that coordinate intrauterine trophoblast migration in humans, rats and mice under physiological and pathological conditions.

KPC-2-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-KP) ST258 has been rapidly expanding and is often associated with serious nosocomial infections. Last-line antibiotics such as colistin and tigecycline often remain the only treatment option. We describe here the evolving genetic background of KPC-KP isolates in Crete, Greece. We tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 34 clinical isolates from patients hospitalized in 2010 and 2013-14. Whole-genome sequences of these isolates were analysed for acquired resistance genes and gene mutations. All KPC-KP isolates belonged to ST258 with the exception of one ST147 isolate. From 2014, 26% of isolates were non-susceptible to all antibiotics, compared with 0 of 11 isolates from 2010. Colistin resistance was associated with mutations in mgrB, which was present in 61% of isolates from 2014. Core-genome MLST analysis showed that pan-resistant isolates were closely related and appeared in two separate clusters. KPC-KP is rapidly evolving to pan-resistance in Crete. We identified molecular resistance markers for pan-resistant isolates and showed that core-genome MLST is a promising tool for molecular fingerprinting of KPC-KP ST258.

"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical used extensively worldwide in the manufacture of plastic polymers. The environmental obesogen hypothesis suggests that early life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals such as BPA may increase the risk for wt gain later in childhood but few prospective epidemiological studies have investigated this relationship. We examined the association of early life BPA exposure with offspring obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors in 500 mother-child pairs from the RHEA pregnancy cohort in Crete, Greece. BPA concentrations were measured in spot urine samples collected at the 1st trimester of pregnancy) and from children at 2.5 and 4 years of age. We measured birth wt, body mass index (BMI) from 6 months to 4 years of age, waist circumference, skinfold thickness, blood pressure, serum lipids, C-reactive protein, and adipokines at 4 years of age. BMI growth trajectories from birth to 4 years were estimated by mixed effects models with fractional polynomials of age. Adjusted associations were obtained via multivariable regression analyses. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was 9% at 2, 13% at 3% and 17% at 4 years of age. Geometric mean BPA concentrations were 1.2μg/g creatinine±7.9 in 1st trimester, 5.1μg/g±13.3 in 2.5 years and 1.9μg/g±4.9 in 4 years. After confounder adjustment, each 10-fold increase in BPA at 4 years was associated with a higher BMI z-score (adj. β=0.2; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.4), waist circumference (adj. β=1.2; 95% CI: 0.1, 2.2) and sum of skinfold thickness (adj. β=3.7mm; 95% CI: 0.7, 6.7) at 4 years. Prenatal BPA was negatively associated with BMI and adiposity measures in girls and positively in boys. We found no associations of early life exposure to BPA with other offspring cardiometabolic risk factors. Prenatal BPA exposure was not consistently associated with offspring growth and adiposity measures but higher early childhood BPA was associated with excess child adiposity."

The archeological record indicates that the permanent settlement of Cyprus began with pioneering agriculturalists circa 11,000 years before present, (ca. 11,000 y BP). Subsequent colonization events followed, some recognized regionally. Here, we assess the Y-chromosome structure of Cyprus in context to regional populations and correlate it to phases of prehistoric colonization. Analysis of haplotypes from 574 samples showed that island-wide substructure was barely significant in a spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA). However, analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) of haplogroups using 92 binary markers genotyped in 629 Cypriots revealed that the proportion of variance among the districts was irregularly distributed. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed potential genetic associations of Greek-Cypriots with neighbor populations. Contrasting haplogroups in the PCA were used as surrogates of parental populations. Admixture analyses suggested that the majority of G2a-P15 and R1b-M269 components were contributed by Anatolia and Levant sources, respectively, while Greece Balkans supplied the majority of E-V13 and J2a-M67. Haplotype-based expansion times were at historical levels suggestive of recent demography. Analyses of Cypriot haplogroup data are consistent with two stages of prehistoric settlement. E-V13 and E-M34 are widespread, and PCA suggests sourcing them to the Balkans and Levant/Anatolia, respectively. The persistent pre-Greek component is represented by elements of G2-U5(xL30) haplogroups: U5*, PF3147, and L293. J2b-M205 may contribute also to the pre-Greek strata. The majority of R1b-Z2105 lineages occur in both the westernmost and easternmost districts. Distinctively, sub-haplogroup R1b- M589 occurs only in the east. The absence of R1b- M589 lineages in Crete and the Balkans and the presence in Asia Minor are compatible with Late Bronze Age influences from Anatolia rather than from Mycenaean Greeks.

"Early-life nutrition is critical for optimal brain development; however, few studies have evaluated the impact of diet as a whole in early childhood on neurological development with inconsistent results. The present analysis is a cross-sectional study nested within an ongoing prospective birth cohort, the Rhea study, and aims to examine the association of dietary patterns with cognitive and psychomotor development in 804 preschool (mean age 4·2 years) children. Parents completed a validated FFQ, and dietary patterns were identified using principal component analysis. Child cognitive and psychomotor development was assessed by the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA). Multivariable linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of dietary patterns with the MSCA scales. After adjustment for a large number of confounding factors, the 'Snacky' pattern (potatoes and other starchy roots, salty snacks, sugar products and eggs) was negatively associated with the scales of verbal ability (β=-1·31; 95 % CI -2·47, -0·16), general cognitive ability (β=-1·13; 95 % CI -2·25, -0·02) and cognitive functions of the posterior cortex (β=-1·20; 95 % CI -2·34, -0·07). Further adjustment for maternal intelligence, folic acid supplementation and alcohol use during pregnancy attenuated the observed associations, but effect estimates remained at the same direction. The 'Western' and the 'Mediterranean' patterns were not associated with child neurodevelopmental scales. The present findings suggest that poorer food choices at preschool age characterised by foods high in fat, salt and sugar are associated with reduced scores in verbal and cognitive ability."

"In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the co-existence of ophthalmic pterygium with other ocular surface lesions in a cohort of patients from the Cretan population. This is a retrospective evaluation of all pterygia in patients examined and treated at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece during an 8-year period (from June 2006 to June 2014). A total of 158 cases was examined. Ocular surface images and medical history were evaluated in order to detect concomitant ocular surface pathological conditions. Concomitant lesions included conjunctival nevi (5 cases, 3.16%), iris nevi (4 cases, 2.53%), conjunctival papillomas (8 cases, 5.06%), conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN; 4 cases, 2.53%) and 6 cases of hypertophy of the plica semilunaris (3.79%). Of note, pterygium was overlying the iris which was occupied by the iris nevus in 2 out of the 4 cases of iris nevus. Overall, our data indicate that ophthalmic pterygium may often co-exist with other clinically significant ocular surface lesions. The association of ophthalmic pterygium with conjunctival papillomas or CIN stresses the potential involvement of human papilloma virus in the pathogenesis of ophthalmic pterygium, whereas the topographical association of pterygium with iris nevus may offer support to the transcameral light pathway pathogenetic mechanism."

Wastewater recycling has been and continues to be practiced all over the world for a variety of reasons including: increasing water availability, combating water shortages and drought, and supporting environmental and public health protection. Nowadays, one of the most interesting issues for wastewater recycling is the on-site treatment and reuse of grey water. During this study the efficiency of a compact Submerged Membrane Bioreactor (SMBR) system to treat real grey water in a single house in Crete, Greece, was examined. In the study, grey water was collected from a bathtub, shower and washing machine containing significant amounts of organic matter and pathogens. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal in the system was approximately 87%. Total suspended solids (TSS) were reduced from 95mgL(-1) in the influent to 8mgL(-1) in the effluent. The efficiency of the system to reduce anionic surfactants was about 80%. Fecal and total coliforms decreased significantly using the SMBR system due to rejection, by the membrane, used in the study. Overall, the SMBR treatment produces average effluent values that would satisfy international guidelines for indoor reuse applications such as toilet flushing.

"This study evaluated the feasibility of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) for the imaging of EX-PRESS(®) implant. This nonrandomized comparative case series was performed at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. The Ellex Eye Cubed (40 MHz) UBM and the Zeiss Visante OCT systems were used. The filtering bleb morphology (BL), aqueous outflow (AS), and tube position (TB) were evaluated by two independent observers using a quality scale of 1 (worst) to 4 (best). Data were also collected on corneal and iris clearance from the tip of the tube (CC and IC, respectively). Data from both the devices were statistically analyzed. P &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Ten eyes of 10 patients (6 males) with EX-PRESS(®) implant were examined. TB, AS, and BL scores using UBM were 2.40 ± 0.39, 3.45 ± 0.72, and 2.45 ± 0.64, respectively. TB, AS, and BL scores for OCT were 3.35 ± 0.41, 1.55 ± 0.43, and 2.55 ± 0.55, respectively. AS was significantly higher with UBM whereas the opposite was true for TB. Differences in BL between OCT and UBM were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). Imaging of the EX-PRESS(®) implant is feasible with both UBM and OCT. Both modalities allow visualization of the position of the implant tube in relation to the iris or cornea and delineate the internal structure of the filtering bleb."

Mental health problems are highly prevalent amongst undocumented migrants (UMs), and often part of their consultations with general practitioners (GPs). Little empirical data are available of how GPs and UMs engage around mental health in Greece, a country with a lack of balance between primary and secondary care and limited healthcare provisions for UMs. To acquire insight in the barriers and levers in the provision of mental healthcare for UMs by GPs in Greece. This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 12 GPs in Crete, Greece with clinical expertise in the care of UMs. All interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim and were analysed using thematic content analysis. Greek GPs recognized many mental health problems in UMs and identified the barriers that prevented them from discussing these problems and delivering appropriate care: growing societal resistance towards UMs, budget cuts in healthcare, administrative obstacles and lack of support from the healthcare system. To overcome these barriers, Greek GPs provided UMs with free access to care and psychotropic drugs free of charge, and referred to other primary care professionals rather than to mental healthcare institutions. Greek GPs experienced substantial barriers in the provision of mental healthcare to UMs and political, economic and organizational factors played a major role.

The objective of the analytic observational study was to present air-pollen counting program results for a 5-year period. Airborne pollens and fungi collection, from both urban and sub-urban areas, were obtained using a special Burkard pollen trap installed on the roof of Chania General Hospital. Aeroallergen concentration measurement was made in a standardized way with fixation of the material collected and then counting using an optical microscope. Annual and total circulating pollen and fungi counts for the study period are presented. In the year 2014, the highest total annual count was recorded, while 2013 was the year with the lowest one. Months with the highest average concentrations were June for the years 2010 and 2011 (1291 and 1114.6 grains/m(3), respectively) and May for the consecutive 3 years 2012-2014 (1120, 890 and 1353.1 g/m(3), respectively). Peak periods for circulating aeroallergens were April-June. Trees pollen accounted for the majority of circulating aeroallergens (615.9 and 677.1 g/m(3) during peak periods in the years 2012 and 2014), while fungi accounted for the majority of circulating aeroallergens (818.5, 729.4, 890.7 spores/m(3)), during the peak periods in the years 2010, 2011 and 2013. Variability in peak airborne allergen periods could be partly explained by the differences in climatic conditions during the study period.

"Leishmaniasis, a neglected vector-borne disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania, is encountered in 98 countries causing serious concerns to public health. The most alarming is the development of parasite drug resistance, a phenomenon increasingly encountered in the field rendering chemotherapy ineffective. Although resistance to drugs is a complex phenomenon, the rate of efflux of the fluorescent dye Rhodamine-123 from the parasite body, using flow cytometry, is an indication of the isolate's ability to efflux the drug, thus avoiding death. The rate of efflux measured 275 Leishmania strains, isolated from patients and dogs from Greece and Cyprus, was measured and mapped to study the geographical distribution of the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene expression as an indication of the drug resistance of the parasite. The map showed that out of the seven prefectures, where dogs presented high efflux rates, five also had patients with high efflux rates. In one, out of the 59 prefectures studied, the highest number of isolates with efflux slope α &gt; 1, in both human and dog isolates, was found; a fact which may suggest that spread of drug resistance is taking place. The virulence of the Leishmania strains, assessed after infecting human macrophages of the THP-1 cell line, fluctuated from 1% to 59.3% with only 2.5% of the isolates showing infectivity &gt; 50%. The most virulent strains were isolated from Attica and Crete."

The present study aimed to evaluate a path analytic model accounting for caregivers' psychological distress that takes into account perceived family cohesion and flexibility, expressed emotion and caregiver's burden associated with the presence of mental illness in the family. 50 first-episode and 50 chronic patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (most recent episode manic severe with psychotic features) recruited from the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, and their family caregivers participated in the study. Family functioning was assessed in terms of cohesion and flexibility (FACES-IV), expressed emotion (FQ), family burden (FBS) and caregivers' psychological distress (GHQ-28). Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of family dynamics on caregivers' psychological distress. The results showed that neither family cohesion nor family flexibility exerted significant direct effects on caregivers' psychological distress. Instead, the effect of flexibility was mediated by caregivers' criticism and family burden indicating an indirect effect on caregivers' psychological distress. These results apply equally to caregivers of first episode and chronic patients. Family interventions aiming to improve dysfunctional family interactions by promoting awareness of family dynamics could reduce the burden and improve the emotional well-being of family caregivers.

Os parietale partitum is a variable segmentation of the parietal bone. This manifests as a parietal division in the anteroposterior or superoinferior planes that is separated by an unusual suture and can be complete or incomplete. The existence of parietal divisions was observed and documented more than 260 years ago. The main objectives of this paper are to record the incidence of this rare trait in four modern populations with no previous records of it and provide a review of the literature. Four contemporary skeletal collections from Crete (Greece), Limassol (Cyprus), Coimbra (Portugal) and Salvador (Brazil) were assessed by the authors of this paper for non-metric cranial traits. Out of 711 skulls, only three cases of parietal division were found and all three originated from the Cypriot collection. These three cases were anatomically analyzed, showing that all three cases were adult females and showed unilateral expression of the trait. Two skulls showed superoinferior division, and the third case showed anteroposterior division. Numerous other cranial non-metric traits were found in these three skulls. Based on the cemetery archives, there seems to be no genetic link between the individuals bearing this trait. Further genetic analysis is suggested in order to verify this conclusion.

Cohort-wide very low-depth whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can comprehensively capture low-frequency sequence variation for the cost of a dense genome-wide genotyping array. Here, we analyse 1x sequence data across the APOC3 gene in a founder population from the island of Crete in Greece (n = 1239) and find significant evidence for association with blood triglyceride levels with the previously reported R19X cardioprotective null mutation (β = -1.09,σ = 0.163, P = 8.2 × 10<sup>-11</sup>) and a second loss of function mutation, rs138326449 (β = -1.17,σ = 0.188, P = 1.14 × 10<sup>-9</sup>). The signal cannot be recapitulated by imputing genome-wide genotype data on a large reference panel of 5122 individuals including 249 with 4x WGS data from the same population. Gene-level meta-analysis with other studies reporting burden signals at APOC3 provides robust evidence for a replicable cardioprotective rare variant aggregation (P = 3.2 × 10<sup>-31</sup>, n = 13 480).

"The evidence regarding a potential link of low-to-moderate iodine deficiency, selenium status, and cadmium exposure during pregnancy with neurodevelopment is either contradicting or limited. We aimed to assess the prenatal impact of cadmium, selenium, and iodine on children's neurodevelopment at 4 years of age. The study included 575 mother-child pairs from the prospective ""Rhea"" cohort on Crete, Greece. Exposure to cadmium, selenium and iodine was assessed by concentrations in the mother's urine during pregnancy (median 13 weeks), measured by ICPMS. The McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities was used to assess children's general cognitive score and seven different sub-scales. In multivariable-adjusted regression analysis, elevated urinary cadmium concentrations (≥0.8 µg/L) were inversely associated with children's general cognitive score [mean change: -6.1 points (95 % CI -12; -0.33) per doubling of urinary cadmium; corresponding to ~0.4 SD]. Stratifying by smoking status (p for interaction 0.014), the association was restricted to smokers. Urinary selenium was positively associated with children's general cognitive score [mean change: 2.2 points (95 % CI -0.38; 4.8) per doubling of urinary selenium; ~0.1 SD], although the association was not statistically significant. Urinary iodine (median 172 µg/L) was not associated with children's general cognitive score. In conclusion, elevated cadmium exposure in pregnancy of smoking women was inversely associated with the children's cognitive function at pre-school age. The results indicate that cadmium may adversely affect neurodevelopment at doses commonly found in smokers, or that there is an interaction with other toxicants in tobacco smoke. Additionally, possible residual confounding cannot be ruled out."

Plant secondary compounds (PSCs) have profound influence on the ecological interaction between plants and their consumers. Glycosides, a class of PSC, are inert in their intact form and become toxic on activation by either plant β-glucosidase enzymes or endogenous β-glucosidases produced by the intestine of the plant-predator or its microbiota. Many insect herbivores decrease activities of endogenous β-glucosidases to limit toxin exposure. However, such an adaptation has never been investigated in nonmodel mammals. We studied three species of spiny mice (Acomys spp.) that vary in their feeding behavior of the glycoside-rich fruit of Ochradenus baccatus. Two species, the common (Acomys cahirinus) and Crete (Acomys minous) spiny mice, behaviorally avoid activating glycosides, while the golden spiny mouse (Acomys russatus) regularly consumes activated glycosides. We fed each species a nontoxic diet of inert glycosides or a toxic diet of activated fruit toxins and investigated the responses of intestinal and microbial β-glucosidase activities. We found that individuals feeding on activated toxins had lower intestinal β-glucosidase activity and that the species that behaviorally avoid activating glycosides also had lower intestinal β-glucosidase activity regardless of treatment. The microbiota represented a larger source of toxin liberation, and the toxin-adapted species (golden spiny mouse) exhibited almost a fivefold increase in microbial β-glucosidase when fed activated toxins, while other species showed slight decreases. These results are contrary to those in insects, where glycoside-adapted species have lower β-glucosidase activity. The glycoside-adapted golden spiny mouse may have evolved tolerance mechanisms such as enhanced detoxification rather than avoidance mechanisms.

"Members of the genus Scutellonema can cause substantial crop losses to ornamental and cultivated plants directly by feeding ectoparasitically on plant roots (Bridge et al., 2005; Coyne et al., 2006). In May 2015, a soil sample from a house garden from Heraklion city in Crete, Greece, was sent for diagnosis of plant-parasitic nematodes. In this place, there had been cactus (Opuntia sp.) plants (probably imported), which were uprooted 3 to 4 years earlier. After that, the area was cropped with cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) in spring-summer and leaf vegetables such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) in autumn-winter. The soil was collected 1 mon after the end of chicory crop. A population density (ca. 30 individuals/100 cm(3) of soil) of spiral nematodes (Scutellonema sp.) was found by extracting soil with the wet sieving and decanting method (Cobb, 1918). Morphological and molecular analyses of females identified the species as Scutellonema brachyurus (Steiner, 1938) Andrássy, 1958. The morphology of females was characterized by a hemispherical lip region with four to six annuli, morphometric data for 12 females were L, 640 to 760 μm; a, 24.6 to 30.6; b, 5.8 to 7.4; c, 69.1 to 99.3; c´ 0.5 to 0.6; stylet, 24.5 to 27.5 μm with anterior part shorter than posterior; and spermatheca nonfunctional and male absent. The morphology agreed with the description of S. brachyurus (van den Berg et al., 2013). Alignment indicated that the D2-D3 and ITS sequences (KU059494 and KU059495, respectively) showed 99% and 100% to 99% similarity, respectively, to other sequences of S. brachyurus (type A) deposited in GenBank from the United States, Italy, and Korea (JX472037-JX472046, DQ328753, FJ485643; and JX472069, JX472070, JX472071, respectively), differing from one to six nucleotides. Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian inference of these sequences placed the Scutellonema sp. in a highly supported (100%) clade that included all S. brachyurus (type A) sequences deposited in GenBank (van den Berg et al., 2013). All identification methods were consistent with S. brachyurus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. brachyurus for Greece. As the cucumbers and the leaf vegetables cultivated in the area were seed planted, we consider that the nematode originated most probably from the cactus plants which had been previously root ball planted. Scutellonema brachyurus may represent a threat for ornamental and cultivated plants production in Crete, Greece. The nematode has been already reported, mainly in greenhouses of six European countries (CABI and EPPO, 2006). In most of these cases, it is hypothesized that the nematode was introduced by imported plant material."

"Leptin represents a potential modulator of developmental programming of childhood obesity. We investigated the association of cord blood leptin with growth trajectories from birth to early childhood. We used data from the prospective mother-child cohort ""Rhea"", Crete, Greece. Cord blood samples from 642 neonates were collected. 578 (90%) children had complete follow up data from birth to 4years. We measured child weight, height, waist circumference, skinfold thicknesses, blood pressure, and serum lipids, leptin, adiponectin and C-reactive protein in early childhood (median 4.2years). We estimated growth trajectories from 3months up to 4years using random-effects linear-spline models. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used adjusting for confounders. Mean cord blood leptin levels were 7.3ng/mL (standard deviation: 6.3). Children with high cord blood leptin (&gt;90th percentile) exhibited lower weight, height and body mass index from 6months to early childhood. Each SD increase in cord blood leptin was associated with lower weight at the age of 4 by 242g (95% CI: -416, -69). In a stratified analysis, the reverse association was observed in children born small for gestational age (p for interaction=0.001), and in those exhibiting rapid infant growth during the first 3months of life (p for interaction=0.002). Cord blood leptin levels were not associated with cardiometabolic risk factors at 4years. Long term programming effects of in utero exposure to leptin extends beyond infancy into early childhood. Further studies are needed to explore potential effect modification by intrauterine and early infancy growth patterns."

"The Cretan diet, as the basis of the Mediterranean diet, has provided traditional remedies for the general well being of people through the long-established consumption of cooked wild greens and vegetables. The intake of the water decoctions of Cichorium spinosum and Cichorium intybus in the context of the daily dietary regime in Greece has been long associated with ""liver detoxifying"" properties. In the current study, we performed an in-depth investigation of the water decoctions traditionally prepared from C. spinosum and C. intybus through qualitative UHPLC-HRMS profiling and direct quantification of cichoric and caftaric acid as major antioxidant components of the decoction. In addition, we developed a one-step countercurrent chromatography method for the isolation of the two phenolic acids, along with a sulfoconjugate sesquiterpene lactone present only in the Cretan C. spinosum. All water decoctions were found not to be cytotoxic in human fibroblasts, whereas they all significantly reduced the intracellular reactive oxygen species, which is consistent with the major presence of strong antioxidant compounds such as cichoric acid. This work demonstrates that the intake of these decoctions in doses suggested by Greek traditional use is comparable to the ingestion of a phytomedical preparation of antioxidants. These results contribute to our current knowledge on the beneficial health effect of the Cretan diet. "

Understanding the processes that led to the recent evolution of Mediterranean landscapes is a challenging question that can be addressed with paleoecological data. Located in the White Mountains of Crete, Asi Gonia peat bog constitutes an exceptional 2000-years-long sedimentary archive of environmental change. In this study, we document the making of the White Mountains landscape and assess human impact on ecosystem trajectories. The paleoenvironmental reconstruction is based on high-resolution analyses of sediment, pollen, dung fungal spores and charcoal obtained from a 6-m core collected from the bog. Multiproxy analyses and a robust chronological control have shed light on anthropogenic and natural processes that have driven ecological changes, giving rise to the present-day Mediterranean ecosystem. Our results suggest that sediment accumulation began during the transition from the Hellenistic to the Roman period, likely due to watershed management. The evolution of the peat bog as well as vegetation dynamics in the surrounding area were linked to past climate changes but were driven by human activities, among which breeding was of great importance. Charcoal analysis reveals that fire was largely used for the construction and maintenance of sylvo-agropastoral areas. Pollen data allow the identification of three main vegetation assemblages: 1) evergreen oak forest (before ca. 850 AD), 2) heather maquis (ca. 850 to 1870 AD), 3) phrygana/steppe landscape. Rapid changes between phases in vegetation development are associated with tipping-points in ecosystem dynamics resulting from anthropogenic impact. The modern ecosystem did not get established until the 20th century, and it is characterized by biodiversity loss along with a dramatic drying of the peat bog.

"Sea turtles are vulnerable to climate change impacts in both their terrestrial (nesting beach) and oceanic habitats. From 1982 to 2012, air and sea surface temperatures at major high use foraging and nesting regions (n = 5) of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting in Greece have steadily increased. Here, we update the established relationships between sea surface temperature and nesting data from Zakynthos (latitude: 37.7°N), a major nesting beach, while also expanding these analyses to include precipitation and air temperature and additional nesting data from two other key beaches in Greece: Kyparissia Bay (latitude: 37.3°N) and Rethymno, Crete (latitude: 35.4°N). We confirmed that nesting phenology at Zakynthos has continued to be impacted by breeding season temperature; however, temperature has no consistent relationship with nest numbers, which are declining on Zakynthos and Crete but increasing at Kyparissia. Then using statistically downscaled outputs of 14 climate models assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we projected future shifts in nesting for these populations. Based on the climate models, we projected that temperature at the key foraging and breeding sites (Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, Crete, Gulf of Gabès and Zakynthos/Kyparissia Bay; overall latitudinal range: 33.0°-45.8°N) for loggerhead turtles nesting in Greece will rise by 3-5°C by 2100. Our calculations indicate that the projected rise in air and ocean temperature at Zakynthos could cause the nesting season in this major rookery to shift to an earlier date by as much as 50-74 days by 2100. Although an earlier onset of the nesting season may provide minor relief for nest success as temperatures rise, the overall climatic changes to the various important habitats will most likely have an overall negative impact on this population."

Viral infections of the central nervous system may have detrimental effects for the developing brain, but the effects of less virulent common infections are unclear. We aim to investigate the impact of common viral infections of early childhood on neuropsychological performance of children at age four. We used cross-sectional data on 674 children participating at the 4 years of age follow-up of the Rhea birth cohort in Crete, Greece. Blood levels of IgG antibodies to 10 polyomaviruses (BKPyV, JCPyV, KIPyV, WUPyV, HPyV6, HPyV7, TSPyV, MCPyV, HPyV9, and HPyV10) and four herpesviruses [Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2)] were measured using multiplex serology. Child's neuropsychological development at age four was assessed using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, the Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Test (ADHDT), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Multiple linear regression models were used to explore the associations. Seroprevalence to polyomaviruses ranged from 21% for HPyV9 to 82% for HPyV10. Seroprevalence for EBV was 53%, for CMV 26%, for HSV-1 3.6%, and for HSV-2 1.5%. Children seropositive to ≥8 polyomaviruses had lower score in ADHDT inattention subscale [β = -1.28 (95% CI: -2.56, -0.001)] and lower score in SDQ hyperactivity-inattention subscale [β = -.99 (95% CI: -1.60, -0.37)] versus children seropositive to ≤3 polyomaviruses. Seropositivity to BKPyV, a potential neurotropic virus, was associated with higher score in ADHDT inattention subscale [β = .87 (95% CI: 0.03, 1.71)]. These findings suggest that acquisition of polyomaviruses during development may influence behavioral outcomes in early childhood.
PMID:27350329	Amson E, Kolb C	Naturwissenschaften. 103(7-8):58	2016	Scaling effect on the mid-diaphysis properties of long bones-the case of the Cervidae (deer). 	How skeletal elements scale to size is a fundamental question in biology. While the external shape of long bones was intensively studied, an important component of their organization is also found in their less accessible inner structure. Here, we studied mid-diaphyseal properties of limb long bones, characterizing notably the thickness of their cortices (bone walls), in order to test whether body size directly influences bone inner organization. Previous examinations of scaling in long bones used broad samplings to encompass a wide range of body sizes. To account for the effect of confounding factors related to different lifestyles, we focused our comprehensive sampling on a mammalian clade that comprises various body sizes but a relatively uniform lifestyle, the Cervidae. Positive allometry was found in femoral cross-sectional shape, indicating greater directional bending rigidity in large-sized taxa. None of the compactness parameters scaled allometrically in any of their bones. The cortices of sampled zeugopodial bones (tibia and radius) were found as significantly thicker than those of stylopodial bones (femur and humerus). Furthermore, while the mean relative cortical thickness values for both stylopodial and zeugopodial bones are close to mass-saving optima, the variance for the stylopodial bones is significantly lower. This suggests that mass saving is less intensively selected in zeugopodial bones. Finally, the long-legged Elk (Alces) and the short-legged dwarf Cretan deer (Candiacervus) featured rather thin and thick cortices, respectively, suggesting that the acquisition of a different limb proportion is accompanied by a modification of the relative mid-diaphyseal cortical thickness.

"The determination of the normal range of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH)D], though currently based on suppression of PTH levels, still remains a controversial issue. The 25-(OH)D levels exhibit gender and seasonal variability, the latter attributed in part to changes of insolation. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the levels of 25-(OH)D on the island of Crete and their correlation with metabolic, hormonal and bone turnover parameters. The study was performed over a period of five years and involved 8,183 male and female individuals (8,042 analyzed). Our results are as follows: (1) 25-(OH)D was significantly lower than expected (19.48±9.51 and 18.01±9.01 (ng/mL+SD) in males and females, respectively); (2) seasonal variation of 25-(OH)D was observed in both sexes (females &lt; males), with values peaking in August; (3) a decline of 25-(OH)D was evident with advancing age, with lower levels in females compared to males up to menopause and no apparent difference between the genders thereafter; (4) levels of 25-(OH)D were lower in renal function impairment, diabetes/insulin resistance and inflammation, while no correlation was detectable in thyroid dysfunction; (5) normalization of PTH levels was observed at ~20 ng/mL 25-(OH)D. At the same cut-off level, a significant decrease of all measured bone turnover indices (b-ALP, osteocalcin and CTX) was evident. Based on the above data, it appears that a cut-off level of 25-(OH)D close to 20 ng/mL better reflects the physiology of our population."

"Vitamin D deficiency is common among pregnant women and may be associated with several adverse health outcomes including cancer. Micronuclei frequency is a biomarker of early genetic effects and has been used to examine the association between genotoxic exposures and cancer. We examined maternal vitamin D levels during pregnancy in associations with micronuclei frequency in maternal blood and in cord blood. 173 mothers and 171 newborns born between 2007 and 2008 in Heraklion (Crete, Greece) were included in the study. Between 14th and 18th weeks of gestation we collected information on maternal diet using food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). We measured maternal serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] between the first and second trimester of pregnancy. We estimated dietary vitamin D intake using information from FFQ. After delivery we collected cord blood and maternal peripheral blood. We used the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay to assess the frequencies of micronucleated cells in binucleated T lymphocytes (MNBN). Maternal insufficient serum levels of 25(OH)D (&lt;50 nmol/L) during pregnancy were associated with increased MNBN frequency in cord blood [IRR = 1.32 (95%CI: 1.00, 1.72)]. This increase was higher for newborns with birth weight above the third quartile [≥3.500 kg; IRR = 2.21 (1.26, 3.89)]. Similarly, low levels of dietary vitamin D were associated with increased MNBN frequency in cord blood [middle tertile IRR = 1.08 (0.78, 1.47), lower tertile IRR = 1.51 (1.06, 2.14)]. Insufficient levels of vitamin D were not associated with MNBN in mothers. Our results suggest that vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases genotoxic risks in newborns. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency globally is high and it is important to further investigate whether vitamin D supplementation or similar interventions during pregnancy could prevent DNA damage at early stages of life."
PMID:27432461	Maraki S, Mavromanolaki VE	Mycoses. 59(12):798-802	2016	Epidemiology of onychomycosis in Crete, Greece: a 12-year study.	Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, yeasts or non-dermatophyte moulds (NDMs). It occurs worldwide and accounts for about 50% of all nail disorders. The incidence of the disease and the prevalence of pathogens involved vary in different geographical areas and change with time. This study was undertaken to determine the epidemiology of onychomycosis in Crete, Greece during a 12-year period. Mycologic nail investigation (direct microscopy and cultures) was performed in samples taken from 3317 patients with clinical suspicion of onychomycosis. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities and concurrent superficial fungal infections at other body sites were also recorded. Onychomycosis was mycologically confirmed in 547 (16.5%) patients. Fingernail onychomycosis was found in 274 (50.1%) patients, toenail onychomycosis in 271 (49.5%), and both toenail and fingernail onychomycosis in two (0.4%). Yeasts were the major causative agents, followed by dermatophytes and NDMs. Candida albicans was the most commonly isolated yeast species and Trichophyton rubrum the most common dermatophyte. Concomitant fungal skin infections were noted in 53 (19.6%) patients with toenail onychomycosis. Factors predisposing to onychomycosis were trauma, diabetes, psoriasis, peripheral circulatory insufficiency and immunosuppression. Mycological investigations are necessary to confirm clinical diagnosis and identify the pathogen, in order to select the most appropriate treatment.

"Determining the depth of villous invasiveness before delivery is pivotal in planning individual management of placenta accreta. We have evaluated the value of various ultrasound signs proposed in the international literature for the prenatal diagnosis of accreta placentation and assessment of the depth of villous invasiveness. We undertook a PubMed and MEDLINE search of the relevant studies published from the first prenatal ultrasound description of placenta accreta in 1982 through March 30, 2016, using key words ""placenta accreta,"" ""placenta increta,"" ""placenta percreta,"" ""abnormally invasive placenta,"" ""morbidly adherent placenta,"" and ""placenta adhesive disorder"" as related to ""sonography,"" ""ultrasound diagnosis,"" ""prenatal diagnosis,"" ""gray-scale imaging,"" ""3-dimensional ultrasound"", and ""color Doppler imaging."" The primary eligibility criteria were articles that correlated prenatal ultrasound imaging with pregnancy outcome. A total of 84 studies, including 31 case reports describing 38 cases of placenta accreta and 53 series describing 1078 cases were analyzed. Placenta accreta was subdivided into placenta creta to describe superficially adherent placentation and placenta increta and placenta percreta to describe invasive placentation. Of the 53 study series, 23 did not provide data on the depth of villous myometrial invasion on ultrasound imaging or at delivery. Detailed correlations between ultrasound findings and placenta accreta grading were found in 72 cases. A loss of clear zone (62.1%) and the presence of bridging vessels (71.4%) were the most common ultrasound signs in cases of placenta creta. In placenta increta, a loss of clear zone (84.6%) and subplacental hypervascularity (60%) were the most common ultrasound signs, whereas placental lacunae (82.4%) and subplacental hypervascularity (54.5%) were the most common ultrasound signs in placenta percreta. No ultrasound sign or a combination of ultrasound signs were specific of the depth of accreta placentation. The wide heterogeneity in terminology used to describe the grades of accreta placentation and differences in study design limits the evaluation of the accuracy of ultrasound imaging in the screening and diagnosis of placenta accreta. This review emphasizes the need for further prospective studies using a standardized evidence-based approach including a systematic correlation between ultrasound signs of placenta accreta and detailed clinical and pathologic examinations at delivery."

"The interaction energetics, molecular packing, entanglement network properties, segmental dynamics, and elastic constants of atactic polystyrene-amorphous silica nanocomposites in the molten and the glassy state are studied via molecular simulations using two interconnected levels of representation: (a) a coarse-grained one, wherein each polystyrene repeat unit is mapped onto a single ""superatom"" and the silica nanoparticle is viewed as a solid sphere. Equilibration at all length scales at this level is achieved via connectivity-altering Monte Carlo simulations. (b) A united-atom (UA) level, wherein the polymer chains are represented in terms of a united-atom forcefield and the silica nanoparticle is represented in terms of a simplified, fully atomistic model. Initial configurations for UA molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are obtained by reverse mapping well-equilibrated coarse-grained configurations. By analysing microcanonical UA MD trajectories, the polymer density profile is studied and the polymer is found to exhibit layering in the vicinity of the nanoparticle surface. An estimate of the enthalpy of mixing between polymer and nanoparticles, derived from the UA simulations, compares favourably against available experimental values. The dynamical behaviour of polystyrene (in neat and filled melt systems) is characterized in terms of bond orientation and dihedral angle time autocorrelation functions. At low concentration in the molten polymer matrix, silica nanoparticles are found to cause a slight deceleration of the segmental dynamics close to their surface compared to the bulk polymer. Well-equilibrated coarse-grained long-chain configurations are reduced to entanglement networks via topological analysis with the CReTA algorithm, yielding a slightly lower density of entanglements in the filled than in the neat systems. UA melt configurations are glassified by MD cooling. The elastic moduli of the resulting glassy nanocomposites are computed through an analysis of strain fluctuations in the undeformed state and through explicit mechanical deformation by MD, showing a stiffening of the polymer in the presence of nanoparticles. UA simulation results for the elastic constants are compared to continuum micromechanical calculations invoked in homogenization models of the overall mechanical behaviour of heterogeneous materials. They can be interpreted in terms of the presence of an ""interphase"" of approximate thickness 2 nm around the nanoparticles, with elastic constants intermediate between those of the filler and the matrix."

"Cone-rod degeneration (CRD) belongs to the disease spectrum of retinal degenerations, a group of hereditary disorders characterized by an extreme clinical and genetic heterogeneity. It mainly differentiates from other retinal dystrophies, and in particular from the more frequent disease retinitis pigmentosa, because cone photoreceptors degenerate at a higher rate than rod photoreceptors, causing severe deficiency of central vision. After exome analysis of a cohort of individuals with CRD, we identified biallelic mutations in the orphan gene CEP78 in three subjects from two families: one from Greece and another from Sweden. The Greek subject, from the island of Crete, was homozygous for the c.499+1G&gt;T (IVS3+1G&gt;T) mutation in intron 3. The Swedish subjects, two siblings, were compound heterozygotes for the nearby mutation c.499+5G&gt;A (IVS3+5G&gt;A) and for the frameshift-causing variant c.633delC (p.Trp212Glyfs(∗)18). In addition to CRD, these three individuals had hearing loss or hearing deficit. Immunostaining highlighted the presence of CEP78 in the inner segments of retinal photoreceptors, predominantly of cones, and at the base of the primary cilium of fibroblasts. Interaction studies also showed that CEP78 binds to FAM161A, another ciliary protein associated with retinal degeneration. Finally, analysis of skin fibroblasts derived from affected individuals revealed abnormal ciliary morphology, as compared to that of control cells. Altogether, our data strongly suggest that mutations in CEP78 cause a previously undescribed clinical entity of a ciliary nature characterized by blindness and deafness but clearly distinct from Usher syndrome, a condition for which visual impairment is due to retinitis pigmentosa."

Many Phlebotomine sand fly species (Diptera, Psychodidae) are vectors of the protozoan parasite Leishmania causing a group of diseases called the leishmaniases. The subgenus Larroussius includes sand fly vectors found in South East Mediterranean Basin responsible for Visceral (VL) and Cutaneous human leishmaniasis (CL). It is important to monitor these medically important insects in order to safely predict possible Leishmania transmission cycles. Leishmania infantum is endemic in the islands of Crete and Cyprus with increasing VL cases in humans and dogs and in Cyprus the newly introduced Leishmania donovani causes both VL and CL in humans. The morphological identification of the females of the subgenus Larroussius often presents difficulties. Morphology and COI PCR - RFLP were used to identify wild caught Larroussius sand flies belonging to Phlebotomus tobbi, P. perfiliewi, and P. neglectus species from Crete and Cyprus. The identification results were further confirmed by sequencing (DNA barcoding) and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. COI PCR - RFLP, when correctly optimized and with respect to geographical origin, can serve as an initial patterning identification tool when large sand fly numbers need to be identified. It could accurately assign Larroussius females and males to their taxa overcoming the difficulties of morphological identification. Finally, DNA barcoding will contribute to a molecular identification database to be used for in-depth species studies.

The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of protein-energy wasting (PEW) in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in our center and determine whether adiponectin and leptin are involved in the development of PEW. Prospective (18 months). University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Seventy-four end-stage-renal-disease patients, 47 on HD and 27 on PD. At three sequential time points (baseline, 6 and 18 months) anthropometric, nutritional and inflammatory status data were collected. Serum adiponectin and leptin were also assessed at each time point. Patients were allocated to 3 strata according to PEW severity (0, 1-2 and ≥3 criteria for PEW). Adiponectin and leptin levels were greater among PD compared to HD patients (p≤0.035). Adiponectin levels were incrementally greater across increasing strata of PEW (p≤0.002). Leptin showed the opposite trend, with lower levels in malnourished patients and higher levels in patients with zero PEW criteria (p≤0.042). Alterations of adiponectin levels during the observation period were dependent on PEW stratum (p≤0.021) and mode of dialysis (p≤0.002), after adjustment for age, dialysis vintage, gender and fat mass index. Particularly, adiponectin levels increased over time in HD patients with ≥3 criteria for PEW, whereas adiponectin levels decreased in PD patients with ≥3 criteria for PEW throughout the study. Leptin alterations over time were not affected by dialysis mode or PEW stratification. Our study provides evidence that increased adiponectin and decreased leptin levels are independently associated with PEW and thus, poor prognosis.

"The aim of the current study is to disseminate long-term ""real-world"" data on mortality and device therapies in primary and secondary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) recipients on the island of Crete. We analyzed data for all consecutive patients who received an ICD in our tertiary university hospital from 1993 until December 2013. Follow-up visits were performed every 6 months or more frequently when indicated. Survival status was recorded, and all stored episodes during interrogation were registered and classified as appropriate or inappropriate. In total, 854 patients received an ICD; 623 (73%) for primary and 231 (27%) for secondary prevention. Most of these patients (490) suffered from ischemic cardiomyopathy. During the mean follow-up of 12.4±7.8 years, 218 (25.5%) patients died; 19.7% in the primary prevention group (p=0.008) and 41.1% in the secondary prevention group. Overall, 248 patients (29%) received appropriate therapy; however, the percentage was significantly higher in the secondary prevention group (44.2%) than in primary prevention group (23.4%). The cumulative incidence of inappropriate therapies during the mean follow-up period was 11.6%. Lead-related complications were noted in 49 patients (5.7%), while only 13 patients (1.5%) suffered device-related infections. The long-term data related to clinical outcomes in ICD recipients in our center are in accordance with those of other international centers and confirm the high efficacy and safety of these devices in preventing sudden cardiac death."

The study assessed whether diet and adherence to cancer prevention guidelines during pregnancy were associated with micronucleus (MN) frequency in mothers and newborns. MN is biomarkers of early genetic effects that have been associated with cancer risk in adults. A total of 188 mothers and 200 newborns from the Rhea cohort (Greece) were included in the study. At early-mid pregnancy, we conducted personal interviews and a validated food frequency questionnaire was completed. With this information, we constructed a score reflecting adherence to the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research cancer prevention guidelines on diet, physical activity and body fatness. At delivery, maternal and/or cord blood was collected to measure DNA and hemoglobin adducts of dietary origin and frequencies of MN in binucleated and mononucleated T lymphocytes (MNBN and MNMONO). In mothers, higher levels of red meat consumption were associated with increased MNBN frequency [2nd tertile IRR = 1.34 (1.00, 1.80), 3rd tertile IRR = 1.33 (0.96, 1.85)] and MNMONO frequency [2nd tertile IRR = 1.53 (0.84, 2.77), 3rd tertile IRR = 2.69 (1.44, 5.05)]. The opposite trend was observed for MNBN in newborns [2nd tertile IRR = 0.64 (0.44, 0.94), 3rd tertile IRR = 0.68 (0.46, 1.01)], and no association was observed with MNMONO. Increased MN frequency in pregnant women with high red meat consumption is consistent with previous knowledge. Our results also suggest exposure to genotoxics during pregnancy might affect differently mothers and newborns. The predictive value of MN as biomarker for childhood cancer, rather than adulthood, remains unclear. With few exceptions, the association between maternal carcinogenic exposures during pregnancy and childhood cancer or early biologic effect biomarkers remains poorly understood.

"Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are highly-resistant compounds to environmental degradation and due to fat solubility they bioaccumulate through the food chain. As they cross the placenta, in utero exposure to POPs could disrupt child neurodevelopment as they are considered to be neurotoxic. We examined whether in utero exposure to levels of different POPs is associated with offspring cognitive and behavioral outcomes at 4years of age in a mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece (Rhea study). We included 689 mother-child pairs. Concentrations of several polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other organochlorine compounds (dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB]) were determined in maternal serum collected in the first trimester of pregnancy by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Neurodevelopment at 4years was assessed by means of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Behavioral difficulties were assessed by Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Test. Linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations between the exposures and outcomes of interest after adjustment for potential confounders. Children with ""high"" HCB concentrations (≥90th percentile) in maternal serum, demonstrated decreased scores in perceptual performance (adjusted β=-6.07; 95% CI: -10.17, -1.97), general cognitive (adjusted β=-4.97; 95% CI: -8.99, -0.96), executive function (adjusted β=-6.24; 95% CI: -10.36, -2.11) and working memory (adjusted β=-4.71; 95% CI: -9.05, -0.36) scales at 4years of age. High exposure to PCBs (≥90th percentile) during pregnancy was associated with a 4.62 points reduction in working memory score at 4years of age (95% CI: -9.10, -0.14). Prenatal exposure to DDE, HCB and PCBs was not associated with child behavioral difficulties. The findings suggest that prenatal exposure to HCB and PCBs may contribute to reduced cognitive development at preschool age. Our results raise the possibility that exposure to HCB may play a more important role in child cognition than previously considered."

Environmental temperatures considerably affect the reptilian ability for thermoregulation and harsh climatic conditions may impose a highly effective body temperature regulation to lizards. Such demanding conditions are more common to extreme mainland habitats (e.g. deserts or mountains). To the contrary, islands have more benign climate conditions thanks to the thermal buffering effect of the surrounding sea. However, this favorable effect may be eliminated in small size islets where the scarcity of thermal shelters and exposure to high winds create challenging conditions. Here we investigate the impact of a tough islet habitat on the thermoregulation of Podarcis levendis, a lacertid lizard endemic to two rocky islets in the north Cretan Sea, Greece. To evaluate the thermoregulatory effectiveness of P. levendis we measured operative and body temperatures in the field and the preferred body temperatures in the lab. Analyses of the thermal data revealed an accurate, precise, and effective thermoregulator, achieving very high thermoregulation values (E =0.91, d<sub>e</sub>¯-d<sub>b</sub>¯ =7.6). This high effectiveness comes to compensate living in an inhospitable habitat as the operative temperatures denote (d<sub>e</sub> =7.79). Our findings, together with the limited published literature, suggested the lack of a general pattern for all insular lizards and indicated a possible deviation for islet habitats.

"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of diverse substances, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides that are resistant to biodegradation and ubiquitously present in our environment. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals such as POPs has been linked to type 2 diabetes and metabolic disturbances in epidemiological and animal studies, but little is known about POPs exposure during pregnancy and the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which exposure to current low levels of different POPs in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with GDM risk in 939 women from the ""Rhea"" pregnancy cohort in Crete, Greece. Concentrations of several PCBs, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were determined in first trimester maternal serum by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. We defined total PCBs as the sum of all congeners, nondioxin-like PCBs as the sum of PCB 153, 138, 170 and 180, and dioxin-like PCBs as the sum of PCB 118 and 156. Pregnant women were screened for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) between 24 and 28weeks of gestation, and GDM was defined by the criteria proposed by Carpenter and Coustan. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models. Of the 939 women, 68 (7%) developed GDM. Serum concentrations of POPs were higher in women with GDM. Women in the medium and high tertiles of PCBs had 3.90 (95% CI: 1.37, 11.06) and 3.60 (95% CI: 1.14, 11.39) fold respectively higher odds of developing GDM compared to women in the lowest tertile of PCB exposure after adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI and several other confounders. Odds of GDM for women in the medium and high tertiles of dioxin-like PCBs was 5.63 (95% CI: 1.81, 17.51) and 4.71 (95% CI: 1.38, 16.01) and for nondioxin-like PCBs 2.36 (95% CI: 0.89, 6.23) and 2.26 (95% CI: 0.77, 6.68) respectively. Prenatal DDE and HCB exposure were not significantly associated GDM risk. These findings suggest that women with high PCBs levels in early pregnancy had higher risk for GDM. Further studies are needed to replicate these results and to evaluate potential biological mechanisms underlying the observed associations."

"Smoking is among the health risk behaviors taken up by many adolescents with lifelong consequences and associations with multiple health risk behaviors. Smoking and smoking initiation in adolescence involves an interaction between micro-, meso-, and macro systems, including neighborhoods and the greater community. To examine the associations of individual social and economic capital with self-reported health, life satisfaction, and smoking behavior in adolescents. Using a multistage random sampling of junior high school students (16-18 years old) in Crete, Greece, 703 adolescents (90.2% 16 years old; 55.6% girls, participation rate 84.2%) completed an anonymous questionnaire based on HBSC study and the Youth Social Capital Scale (YSCS) during April-June 2008. Multiple logistic regression models were performed adjusted for potential confounders. Adolescents with high participation in their neighborhoods and communities (higher structural social capital) displayed lower odds for daily smoking; those feeling unsafe (lower cognitive social capital) were at greater odds of daily smoking. Adolescents with less friends and acquaintances had lower odds of having tried tobacco products. Smoking was not related to any economic capital variables (perceived affluence, paternal and maternal employment status). Adolescents with low/medium versus high total social capital were at higher odds for low life satisfaction and fair/bad versus excellent self-rated health. Conclusions/Importance: Social capital theory may provide a better understanding in identifying the social context that is protective or harmful to adolescents' smoking. Public health organizations at all levels need to incorporate social capital theory in their interventions."

"Plant-parasitic nematode species have been reported on several occasions from coastal sand dunes, including <i>Longidorus</i> and <i>Rotylenchus</i> species (Vovlas et al., 2008; De Luca et al., 2009; Mateille et al., 2014). In April 2016, 10 soil samples of 3 to 4 kg from the rhizosphere of <i>Tamarix smyrnensis</i> with different vegetation around (viz. <i>Elymus farctus</i>, <i>Lycium schweinfurthii</i>, <i>Crithmum maritimum</i>, and <i>Arthrocnemum</i> sp.) were collected for diagnosis of plant-parasitic nematodes. The area of sampling was a coastal sand dune near the archeological site of Komos, southwest of Crete, Greece. Low soil populations of a needle and a spiral nematode were detected (3 and 8 individuals/1,000 cm<sup>3</sup> of soil, respectively), which prompted us to undertake a detailed morphological and molecular comparative study with previous reported data. Nematodes were extracted from soil with the wet sieving and decanting method (Cobb, 1918). Morphological and molecular analyses of females identified these species as <i>Longidorus kuiperi</i> Brinkman, Loof and Barbez, 1987, and <i>Rotylenchus eximius</i> Siddiqi, 1964. The morphology of <i>L. kuiperi</i> females (six specimens studied) was characterized by having a slender body; very broad lip region (27 ± 1.5 [25 to 30] μm in width); short, hemispherical tail; body length of (7.1 ± 0.8 [6.5 to 8.5] mm); vulva position at 47% to 55% of body length; odontostyle length of (105 ± 6.5 [90 to 115] μm); males very common (but less frequent than females [45% <i>vs</i> 55%]); tail region with 15 to 20 supplements and bulged terminal cuticle. The morphology of <i>R. eximius</i> females (four specimens studied) was characterized by having a hemispherical lip region clearly set off; with four annuli; body without longitudinal striations; lateral fields areolated in the pharyngeal region only; stylet 36 to 38 μm; and broadly rounded tail. The morphology of the isolated nematodes agreed with previous descriptions of <i>L. kuiperi</i> (Brinkman et al., 1987; De Luca et al., 2009), and <i>R. eximius</i> (Siddiqi, 1964; Castillo and Vovlas, 2005). A single individual was used for DNA extraction. Primers and polymerase chain reaction conditions used in this research were specified in Cantalapiedra et al. (2013) and Archidona-Yuste et al. (2016), and a single amplicon of 800 and 1,100 bp was obtained and sequenced, respectively. D2-D3 (KX398055-KX398056) and ITS sequence alignments (751 and 648 bp, respectively) from <i>L. kuiperi</i> (KX398057) showed 98% to 99% similarity, differing in 4, and from 6 to 12 nucleotides, respectively, to other sequences of <i>L. kuiperi</i> deposited in GenBank from Italy and Spain (AM911623, AM905267-AM905270, respectively), with a query coverage of 99%. Similarly, D2-D3 sequence alignment from <i>R. eximius</i> (KX398058) showed 100% to 99% to another sequence of <i>R. eximius</i> deposited in GenBank from Italy and Spain (EU280794, DQ328741), differing in zero to three nucleotides, respectively, and a query coverage of 81%. Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian Inference placed <i>L. kuiperi</i> in a highly supported (100%) clade that included all <i>L. kuiperi</i> sequences deposited in GenBank (Archidona-Yuste et al., 2016), and <i>R. eximius</i> in a highly supported (100%) clade that included all <i>R. eximius</i> sequences deposited in GenBank (Cantalapiedra-Navarrete et al., 2013). All identification methods were consistent with <i>L. kuiperi</i> and <i>R. eximius</i>. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>L. kuiperi</i> and <i>R. eximius</i> in Greece. Consequently, all these data suggest that coastal sand dunes in Europe constitute environmental conditions optimal for colonization and development of <i>L. kuiperi</i>, as previously reported (De Luca et al., 2009). Similarly, <i>R. eximius</i> has been reported in several Mediterranean countries, including Italy, Morocco, Spain, and Tunisia (Castillo and Vovlas, 2005), and this report extend the geographical distribution of this species."

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the functionality of a new design of a thick endocapsular open ring for prevention of anterior capsule opacification (ACO) and posterior capsule opacification (PCO). The Institute of Vision and Optics, University of Crete and University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Prospective, interventional pilot study. Fifteen patients (17 eyes) underwent cataract surgery with phacoemulsification. During surgery, a thick endocapsular open ring (peripheral capsule reconstructor) was inserted into the capsular bag, prior to intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Six different models of IOL were implanted. Postoperatively, the degree of ACO and PCO was evaluated and described as none, mild, moderate, or severe. The mean follow-up period was 30±8.06 months (range: 12-36 months). At the last follow-up, mild PCO was observed in only three eyes and mild ACO in three patients. The centration of IOLs was good in all but one eye, which had a tilted IOL. The results of this pilot study suggest that the implantation of a new design of thick endocapsular open ring is feasible and may contribute to the prevention of PCO and ACO after cataract surgery.

Placenta accreta is defined as abnormal adhesion of placental villi to the uterine myometrium. Although this condition has become more common as a result of the increasing rate of cesarean sections, the underlying causative mechanism(s) remain elusive. Because microRNA-29a/b/c (miR-29a/b/c) have been shown to play important roles in placental development, this study evaluated the roles of these microRNAs in placenta accreta. Expression of miR-29a/b/c and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) were quantified in patient tissues and HTR8/SVneo trophoblast cells using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Western blotting was used to analyze expression of the MCL1 protein in HTR8/SVneo trophoblast cells with altered expression of miR-29a/b/c. To determine their role in apoptosis, miR-29a/b/c were overexpressed in HTR-8/SVneo cells, and levels of apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Luciferase activity assays were used to determine whether MCL1 is a target gene of miR-29a/b/c. Expression of miR-29a/b/c was significantly lower in creta sites compared to noncreta sites (p = 0.018, 0.041, and 0.022, respectively), but expression of MCL1 was upregulated in creta sites (p = 0.039). MCL1 expression was significantly downregulated in HTR-8/SVneo cells overexpressing miR-29a/b/c (p = 0.002, 0.008, and 0.013, respectively). Luciferase activity assays revealed that miR-29a/b/c directly target the 3' untranslated region of MCL1 in 293T cells. Over-expression of miR-29a/b/c induced apoptosis in the HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cell line. Moreover, histopathological evaluation revealed that the number of implantation site intermediate trophoblast (ISIT) cells was increased in creta sites and that these cells were positive for MCL1. Our results demonstrate that in placenta accreta, miR-29a/b/c inhibits apoptosis of ISIT cells by targeting MCL1. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of placenta accreta.

PMID:27904054	Maraki S, Mavromanolaki VE	Med Mycol J. 57(4):E69-E75	2016	Epidemiology of Dermatophytoses in Crete, Greece. 	Dermatophytoses are among the most frequently diagnosed skin infections worldwide. However, the distribution of pathogenic species and the predominating anatomical sites of infection vary with geographical location and change over time. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological and aetiological factors of dermatophytoses in Crete, Greece over the last 5-year period (2011-2015) and their incidence in relation to the gender and the age of the patients. We compared our findings with those previously reported from the same area and from other parts of the world. A total of 2,910 clinical specimens (skin scrapings, nail clippings, and hair specimens) obtained from 2,751 patients with signs of dermatomycoses were examined using direct microscopy and culture. Overall, 294 specimens (10.1%) were proved mycologically positive for dermatophytes. The age of the patients ranged from 2 to 86 years (mean age, 37 years). Tinea corporis was the predominant clinical type of infection, followed by tinea unguium, tinea pedis, tinea capitis, tinea faciei, tinea cruris and tinea manuum. Among dermatophytes, eight species were isolated: Microsporum canis (35.8%), Trichophyton rubrum (35.1%), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (23.3%), Epidermophyton floccosum (2.5%), Microsporum gypseum (1.8%), Trichophyton violaceum (0.7%), Trichophyton verrucosum (0.4%), and Trichophyton tonsurans (0.4%). In our area, the most common dermatophyte was M. canis followed by T. rubrum. Increased migration, mass tourism, and climate changes will contribute to further changes in the epidemiology of dermatophytoses in our area. Continuing studies are necessary for determining the new epidemiological trends and to implement the appropriate control measures.

"Sex estimation is an essential step in the identification process of unknown heavily decomposed human remains as it eliminates all possible matches of the opposite sex from the missing person's database. Osteometric methods constitute a reliable approach for sex estimation and considering the variation of sexual dimorphism between and within populations; standards for specific populations are required to ensure accurate results. The current study aspires to contribute osteometric data on the tibia from contemporary Greek-Cypriots to assist the identification process. A secondary goal involves osteometric comparison with data from Crete, a Greek island with similar cultural and dietary customs and environmental conditions. Left tibiae from one hundred and thirty-two skeletons (70 males and 62 females) of Greek-Cypriots and one hundred and fifty-seven skeletons (85 males, 72 females) of Cretans were measured. Seven standard metric variables including Maximum length (ML), Upper epiphyseal breadth (UB), Nutrient foramen anteroposterior diameter (NFap), Nutrient Foramen transverse diameter (NFtrsv), Nutrient foramen circumference (NFCirc), Minimum circumference (MinCirc) and Lower epiphyseal breadth (LB) were compared between sexes and populations. Univariate and multivariate discriminant functions were developed and posterior probabilities were calculated for each sample. Results confirmed the existence of sexual dimorphism of the tibia in both samples as well as the pooled sample. Classification accuracy for univariate functions ranged from 78% to 85% for Greek-Cypriots and from 69% to 83% for Cretans. The best multivariate equations after cross-validation resulted in 87% for Greek-Cypriots and 90% accuracy for Cretans. When the samples were pooled accuracy reached 87% with over 95% confidence for about one third of the population. Estimates with over 95% of posterior probability can be considered reliable while any less than 80% should be treated with caution. This work constitutes the initial step towards the creation of an osteometric database for Greek-Cypriots and we hope it can contribute to the biological profiling and identification of the missing and to potential forensic cases of unknown skeletal remains both in Cyprus and Crete."

The fruit of Lycium barbarum L. (Solanaceae), known as goji berry, has been exploited for a long time in traditional Chinese medicine. In recent decades, it has received much attention as one of the trendiest functional foods with a wide array of pharmacological activities in Western diets. In this study the phenolic profile and potential antioxidant capacity of Lycium barbarum cultivated in Crete (Greece) were investigated. The berries were defatted with hexane and then extracted with dichloromethane and methanol using a Soxhlet apparatus. Furthermore, the methanol extract was fractionated with ethyl acetate and butanol. All fractions/extracts were tested for their antioxidant activity (DPPH, FRAP, chemiluminescence). Folin-Ciocalteu and LC-DAD-MS analyses were utilized for the identification of the phenolic compounds. The total phenolic content ranged from 14.13 ± 0.40 (water fraction) to 109.72 ± 4.09 (ethyl acetate fraction) mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry extract. Ethyl acetate extract exhibited the highest scavenging activities determined as EC<sub>50</sub> (4.73 ± 0.20 mg/mL) and IC<sub>50</sub> (0.47 ± 0.001 mg/mL) using DPPH and chemiluminescence assays. Seventeen phenolic compounds, including cinnamoylquinic acids and derivatives, hydrocinnamic acids and flavonoid derivatives, were tentatively identified. To the best of our knowledge, quercetin 3-O-hexose coumaric ester and quercetin 3-O-hexose-O-hexose-O-rhamnose are reported for the first time in goji berry fruits. The results of this study suggest that consumption of goji berry fruits could serve as a potential source of natural antioxidant compounds and that goji berry phenolic extracts could be exploited for nutritional pharmaceutical purposes.

"YKL-40 is a secreted glycoprotein and has been implicated in the proliferation and differentiation of malignant cells, extracellular tissue remodelling, neovascularisation, inhibition of cancer cell apoptosis and stimulation of tumour-associated fibroblasts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate YKL-40 tissue expression in extravillous trophoblast invasion and its possible implication in placenta creta. A total of 35 placenta creta cases and six control cases were included in the study, of which eight cases were placenta accreta, 12 were increta and 15 were percreta. Histological YKL-40 staining was scored in tissue as weak (1), medium (2) and strong (3). YKL-40 immunoreactivity intensity in the percreta group was significantly higher compared to the increta and accreta groups (2.47±0.74, 1.33±0.49 and 1.37±0.52, respectively; P=0.000). YKL-40 immunoreactivity intensity was positively correlated with creta (r=0.6; P=0.000), depth of invasion (r=0.49; P=0.003) and depth of invasion to full thickness ratio (r=0.58; P=0.000). This study demonstrated that YKL-40 is strongly expressed in placenta percreta and is correlated with extravillous trophoblast invasion. These findings may be informative for understanding the pathophysiology of placenta creta."

Cross-sectional study where anthropometric, biochemical and clinical measurements were taken in addition to interview-based completion of an extensive questionnaire on health and lifestyle parameters. Dietary patterns were derived through principal component analysis based on a validated FFQ. Geographically isolated Mylopotamos villages on Mount Idi, Crete, Greece. Adults (n 1553). Mean age of the participants was 61·6 years and 55·8 % were women. Of the population, 82·7 % were overweight or obese with a significantly different prevalence between overweight men and women (43·4 v. 34·7 %, P=0·002). The majority (70·6 %) of participants were married, while a larger proportion of women were widowed than men (27·8 v. 3·5 %, P&lt;0·001). Smoking was more prevalent in men (38·7 v. 8·2 %, P&lt;0·001), as 88·8% of women had never smoked. Four dietary patterns emerged as characteristic of the population; these were termed 'local', 'high fat and sugar, 'Greek café/tavern' and 'olive oil, fruits and vegetables'. Individuals more adherent to the local dietary pattern presented higher blood glucose (β=4·026, P&lt;0·001). Similarly, individuals with higher compliance with the Greek café/tavern pattern had higher waist-to-hip ratio (β=0·012, P&lt;0·001), blood pressure (β=1·015, P=0·005) and cholesterol (β=5·398, P&lt;0·001).

Few epidemiological studies evaluated associations between perinatal complications and maternal mood at the early postpartum period and the findings are inconsistent. We aimed at investigating a wide range of complications during pregnancy, at delivery, and at the early postpartum period as determinants of postpartum depression (PPD) at 8 weeks postpartum. A total of 1037 women who enrolled in the Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece participated in the present study. Information on pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications was obtained from clinical records or by questionnaires. Postpartum depressive symptoms were assessed at 8 weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were fit to estimate the association between pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications and maternal depressive symptoms, adjusting also for potential confounders. The prevalence of women with probable depression (EPDS score ≥ 13) was 13.6% at 8 weeks postpartum. Gestational hypertension and/or preeclampsia (β coefficient 1.86, 95% CI: 0.32, 3.41) and breastfeeding difficulties (β coefficient 0.77, 95% CI: 0.02, 1.53) were significantly associated with higher PPD symptoms. Sleep patterns during pregnancy, such as sleep deprivation (OR = 3.57, 95% CI: 1.91, 6.67) and snoring (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.93), and breastfeeding duration less than 2 months (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.64) were significantly associated with increase in the odds for PPD. Some other complications, such as unplanned pregnancy and hospitalisation during pregnancy were also associated with EPDS score, but these associations were explained by socio-demographic characteristics of the mother. We found that several pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications may have an adverse effect on maternal mood at the early postpartum period. These findings have considerable implications for developing effective prevention and early psychoeducational intervention strategies for women at risk of developing PPD.

These effects include the dissolution and transport of excess quantities of fertilizer major- and trace-elements to the groundwater that deteriorate the quality of drinking and irrigation water. In this study, a map for the Fertilizer Water Pollution Index (FWPI) was generated for assessing the impact of agricultural fertilizers on drinking and irrigation water quality. The proposed methodology was applied to one of the most intensively cultivated with tree crops area in Crete (Greece) where potential pollutant loads are derived exclusively from agricultural activities and groundwater is the main water source. In this region of 215 km<sup>2</sup>, groundwater sampling data from 235 wells were collected over a 15-year time period and analyzed for the presence of anionic (ΝΟ<sup>-3</sup>, PO<sup>-3</sup><sub>4</sub>) and cationic (K<sup>+1</sup>, Fe<sup>+2</sup>, Mn<sup>+2</sup>, Zn<sup>+2</sup>, Cu<sup>+2</sup>, B<sup>+3</sup>) fertilizer trace elements. These chemicals are the components of the primary fertilizers used in local tree crop production. Eight factors/maps were considered in order to estimate the spatial distribution of groundwater contamination for each fertilizer element. The eight factors combined were used to generate the Fertilizer Water Pollution Index (FWPI) map indicating the areas with drinking/irrigation water pollution due to the high groundwater contamination caused by excessive fertilizer use. Moreover, by taking into consideration the groundwater flow direction and seepage velocity, the pathway through which groundwater supply become polluted can be predicted. The groundwater quality results show that a small part of the study area, about 8 km<sup>2</sup> (3.72%), is polluted or moderately polluted by the excessive use of fertilizers. Considering that in this area drinking water sources (wells) are located, this study highlights an analytic method for delineation wellhead protection zones. All these approaches were incorporated in a useful GIS decision support system that aids decision makers in the difficult task of protection groundwater resources.

The role of environment and the relative significance of endogenous versus exogenous selection in shaping hybrid zones have been crucial issues in the studies of hybridization. Recent advances in ecological niche modeling (ENM) offer new methodological tools, especially in combination with the genotyping of individuals in the hybrid zone. Here, we study the hybrid zone between the widely known spices <i>Origanum onites</i> and <i>Origanum vulgare</i> ssp. <i>hirtum</i> in Crete. We analyze the genetic structure of both parental taxa and their hybrid <i>Origanum </i>×<i> intercendens</i> using AFLP markers on 15 sympatric and 12 allopatric populations and employ ecological niche modeling and niche similarity tests to study their niche patterns. We complement these analyses with seed viability measurements. Our study revealed that the hybridizing taxa <i>O. onites</i> and <i>O. vulgare</i> ssp. <i>hirtum</i> and the resulting genotypic classes showed geographical and environmental niche similarities based on the predictions of ENMs and the subsequent similarity tests. The occurrence of the hybrid zone is not directly dependent on environmental factors which favor the fitness of the hybrid compared to the parental taxa, but rather on aspects such as historical factors and management practices, which may contribute to the localization and maintenance of the contact zone between parental species. Our results suggest that if a minimum required niche differentiation between genotypic classes is not achieved, environmental dependence might not have a prominent role on the outcome of the hybridization.

"Avermectin and pyrethroid resistance mutations (the G314D and the G326E in the glutamate gated chloride channels, and the F1538I in the voltage gated sodium channel) have been reported in the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, one of the most devastating pests of protected and open field crops worldwide. We developed three TaqMan molecular diagnostic assays for monitoring the presence and frequency of these mutations in T. urticae field populations. The TaqMan assays were validated against known genotypes and subsequently used to monitor the frequency of the resistance mutations in eleven T. urticae populations from Greece and Cyprus, with variable history of avermectin and pyrethroids applications. The frequency of the F1538I pyrethroid resistance mutation largely varied among samples, with highest frequencies (75%-97%) detected in four populations derived from protected and open field crops from Crete and Peloponnesus, low frequencies in three populations (2.5%-11%) from Attiki, Cyprus and Crete and not detected in four populations from Crete, Peloponnesus and Cyprus. The frequency of the abamectin resistance mutations G314D and G326E also varied across populations (from 0 to 100%), showing fixation in two populations (&gt;97.5% for the G314D and 100% for the G326E), originating from rose greenhouses from Greece, low frequencies in three populations (5%-12.5%) also originating from rose greenhouses (Crete, Peloponnesus and Cyprus) and not detected in six populations from protected and open field vegetable crops. The TaqMan diagnostics showed higher resolution in detecting specific alleles in low frequency, compared to massive quantitative sequencing approaches previously employed. They can be used, together with classical bioassays, to support evidence - based insecticide resistance management strategies."

"Studies have suggested an association between maternal obesity pre-pregnancy and gestational diabetes (GDM) with impaired offspring neurodevelopment, but it is not clear if these associations are explained by shared familiar characteristics. We aimed to assess the associations of maternal and paternal obesity, maternal glucose intolerance in early pregnancy and GDM, with offspring neurodevelopment at 4 years of age. We included 772 mother-child pairs from the ""Rhea"" Mother-Child cohort in Crete, Greece. Data on maternal/paternal body mass index (BMI) and maternal fasting serum samples for glucose and insulin measurements were collected at 12 weeks of gestation. GDM screening was performed at 24-28 weeks. Neurodevelopment at 4 years was assessed using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Behavioral difficulties were assessed by Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Test. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that maternal obesity was associated with a significant score reduction in general cognitive ability (β-coeff -4.03, 95% CI: -7.08, -0.97), perceptual performance (β-coeff -4.60, 95% CI: -7.74, -1.47), quantitative ability (β-coeff -4.43, 95% CI: -7.68, -1.18), and executive functions (β-coeff -4.92, 95% CI: -8.06, -1.78) at 4 years of age, after adjustment for several confounders and paternal BMI. Maternal obesity was also associated with increased behavioral difficulties (β-coeff 1.22, 95% CI: 0.09, 2.34) and ADHD symptoms (β-coeff 4.28, 95% CI: 1.20, 7.36) at preschool age. Paternal obesity maternal glucose intolerance in early pregnancy and GDM was not associated with child neurodevelopment. These findings suggest that maternal obesity may impair optimal child neurodevelopment at preschool age independently of family shared characteristics."

This study aims to investigate relations of serum leptin at age 4 with development of adiposity and linear growth during 3 years of follow-up among 75 Greek children and to identify serum metabolites associated with leptin at age 4 and to characterize their associations with adiposity gain and linear growth. Linear regression models that accounted for maternal age, education and gestational weight gain and child's age and sex were used to examine associations of leptin and leptin-associated metabolites measured at age 4 with indicators of adiposity and linear growth at age 7. Each 1-unit increment in natural log-(ln)-transformed leptin corresponded with 0.33 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.55) units greater body mass index-for-age z-score gain during follow-up. Likewise, higher levels of the leptin-associated metabolites methylmalonyl-carnitine and glutaconyl-carnitine corresponded with 0.14 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.27) and 0.07 (95% CI: -0.01, 0.16) units higher body mass index-for-age z-score gain, respectively. These relationships did not differ by sex or baseline weight status and were independent of linear growth. These findings suggest that leptin, methylmalonyl-carnitine and possibly glutaconyl-carnitine are associated with weight gain during early childhood. Future studies are warranted to confirm these findings in other populations.

"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence and infection intensity of intestinal parasites in different dog and cat populations in Crete, Greece, estimate the zoonotic risk and identify risk factors. Faecal samples from shelter, household and shepherd dogs and shelter and household cats were analyzed using sedimentation/flotation techniques. Giardia and Cryptosporidium were detected by a quantitative direct immunofluorescence assay (IFA). PCR and sequencing was performed to evaluate the zoonotic potential of Giardia and Cryptosporidium positive samples. Totals of 879 dog and 264 cat faecal samples were examined. In dogs, the overall prevalence was 25.2% (CI: 22.4-28.1) for Giardia spp.; 9.2% (CI: 7.3-11.1) for Ancylostoma/Uncinaria spp.; 7.6% (CI: 5.9-9.4) for Toxocara spp.; 5.9% (CI: 4.4-7.5) for Cryptosporidium spp.; 4.6% (CI: 3.2-5.9) for Cystoisospora spp.; 2.7% (CI: 1.7-3.8) for Toxascaris leonina; 1.7% (CI: 0.9-2.6) for Capillaria spp.; 0.8% (CI: 0.2-1.4) for taeniid eggs; 0.2% (CI: 0-0.5) for Dipylidium caninum; and 0.1% (CI: 0-0.3) for Strongyloides stercoralis. In cats, the prevalence was 20.5% (CI: 15.6-25.3) for Giardia spp.; 9.5% (CI: 5.9-13.0) for Cystoisospora spp.; 8.3% (CI: 5.0-11.7) for Toxocara spp.; 7.6% (CI: 4.4-10.8) for Ancylostoma/Uncinaria spp.; 6.8% (CI: 3.8-9.9) for Cryptosporidium spp.; 4.2% (CI: 1.8-6.6) for Capillaria spp.; 0.8% (CI: 0-1.8) for taeniid eggs; and 0.4% (CI: 0-1.1) for Hammondia/Toxoplasma. Concerning the risk factors evaluated, there was a negative association between age and Giardia infection and between age and T. leonina infection intensity for dogs. Sequencing results revealed the presence of mainly animal-specific G. duodenalis assemblages C and D in dogs and assemblages F, C and BIV-like in cats, with only a limited number of (co-)infections with assemblage A. As for Cryptosporidium, the dog-specific C. canis and the pig-specific C. scrofarum were detected in dogs and the cat-specific C. felis was detected in cats. High levels of parasitism in both dogs and cats were recorded. Giardia was the most prevalent parasite in all dog and cat populations except for shepherd dogs. Genotyping results suggest a limited zoonotic risk of Giardia and Cryptosporidium infections from dogs and cats in Crete. Taeniid eggs were more prevalent in shepherd dogs suggesting access to carcasses and posing a threat for cystic echinococcosis transmission. Infection rates of Toxocara spp. in both dogs and cats show that companion animals could be a significant source of infection to humans."

"The Cancer Registry of Crete is a regional population database that collects cancer morbidity/mortality data along with several risk factors. The current study assessed the geographical variation of lung cancer among ever and never smokers in Crete during the last 20 years. Lung cancer patient records (1992-2013) including information on medical history and smoking habits were obtained from the Cancer Registry of Crete. Age-Adjusted Incidence Rates (AAIR), prevalence of smoking among lung cancer patients and the Population-Attributable Fraction (PAF%) of tobacco smoking were estimated. Kaplan-Meier curves, grouped per smoking status were constructed, and spatio-temporal analyses were carried out to assess the geographical variations of lung cancer and smoking (a = 0.05). New lung cancer cases in Crete accounted for 9% of all cancers (AAIR<sub>both genders</sub> = 40.2/100,000/year, AAIR<sub>males</sub> = 73.1/100,000/year, AAIR<sub>females</sub> = 11.8/100,000/year). Ever smokers presented significantly higher incidence compared to ex-smokers (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and never smokers (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The highest increase was observed in ever smokers (AAIR<sub>1992</sub> = 19.2/100,000/year, AAIR<sub>2013</sub> = 25.4/100,000/year, <i>p</i> = 0.03), while never smokers presented the lowest increase from 1992 to 2013 (AAIR<sub>1992</sub> = 5.3/100,000/year, AAIR<sub>2013</sub> = 6.8/100,000/year, <i>p</i> = 0.2). The PAF% of lung cancer mortality is 86% for both genders (males: 89%, females: 78%). AAIRs ranged from 25 to 50/100,000/year, while significant geographical differences were observed among the municipalities of Crete (<i>p</i> = 0.02). Smokers living in the south-east urban regions presented higher risk of dying from lung cancer (RR = 2.2; 95%CI = 1.3-3.5). The constant increase of lung cancer rates among both genders, especially in females, outlines the need for targeted, geographically-oriented, life-style preventive measures. Design of population-based screening programs, tobacco awareness campaigns and smoking cessation programs in lung cancer hot spots could be guide by these findings."

"In children, abdominal obesity is a better predictor of the presence of cardiovascular risk factors than body mass index (BMI)-defined obesity. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of abdominal obesity in the Greek pediatric population and to assess the impact of residence on the prevalence of both BMI-defined and abdominal obesity. In the context of the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative of the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe, a national representative sample of 7.0-7.9 and 9.0-9.9-year-old children was evaluated (n = 2,531 and 2,700, respectively). Overweight and obesity according to BMI were estimated using both the WHO and International Obesity Task Force cut-off points. Abdominal obesity was defined as waist circumference/height ratio &gt;0.5. The prevalence of abdominal obesity did not differ between 7-year-old boys and girls (25.2 and 25.3%, respectively; p = NS). Among 9-year-old children, abdominal obesity was more prevalent in boys than in girls (33.2 and 28.2%, respectively; p = 0.005). Among normal weight and overweight children, the prevalence of abdominal obesity was 1.6-6.8 and 21.8-49.1%, respectively. The prevalence of abdominal and BMI-defined obesity did not differ between children living in the mainland, in Crete and in other islands except in 7-year-old girls, where the prevalence of BMI-defined obesity was highest in those living in Crete, intermediate in those living in other islands and lowest in those living in the mainland. In 9-year-old boys and in 7- and 9-year-old girls, the prevalence of abdominal obesity was highest in children living in Athens and lowest in children living in Thessaloniki, whereas children living in other cities and in villages showed intermediate rates. The prevalence of abdominal obesity in 7-year-old boys and the prevalence of BMI-defined obesity did not differ between children living in cities and villages. The prevalence of pediatric abdominal obesity in Greece is among the highest worldwide. Boys and children living in the capital are at higher risk for becoming obese. Given that abdominal obesity is more prevalent than BMI-defined obesity and appears to be more sensitive in identifying cardiovascular risk, measurement of waist circumference might have to be incorporated in the screening for childhood obesity."

This survey investigated the distribution of various intestinal parasites and vector-borne pathogens in stray and free-roaming cats living in four regions of Greece. A total number of one hundred and fifty cats living in three Islands (Crete, Mykonos and Skopelos) and in Athens municipality was established as a realistic aim to be accomplished in the study areas. All cats were examined with different microscopic, serological and molecular assays aiming at evaluating the occurrence of intestinal parasites, and exposure to or presence of vector-borne infections. A total of 135 cats (90%) was positive for one or more parasites and/or pathogens transmitted by ectoparasites. Forty-four (29.3%) cats were positive for one single infection, while 91 (60.7%) for more than one pathogen. A high number of (n. 53) multiple infections caused by feline intestinal and vector-borne agents including at least one zoonotic pathogen was detected. Among them, the most frequently recorded helminths were roundworms (Toxocara cati, 24%) and Dipylidium caninum (2%), while a high number of examined animals (58.8%) had seroreaction for Bartonella spp., followed by Rickettsia spp. (43.2%) and Leishmania infantum (6.1%). DNA-based assays revealed the zoonotic arthropod-borne organisms Bartonella henselae, Bartonella clarridgeiae, Rickettsia spp., and L. infantum. These results show that free-ranging cats living in areas of Greece under examination may be exposed to a plethora of internal parasites and vector-borne pathogens, some of them potentially able to infect humans. Therefore, epidemiological vigilance and appropriate control measures are crucial for the prevention and control of these infections and to minimize the risk of infection for people.

"To demonstrate whether young people with T1D using modern insulin treatment and CGM could successfully participate in extreme sport activity while maintaining good glycemic control. The challenge took place in Crete/Greece over 4 days combining a long-distance trek of different levels of severity with final destination the summit of the White Mountains at 2080 m. Eleven participants (5/6 female/male, age 18.2 ± 1.3 years, T1D duration 7.9 ± 3.5 years, HbA1c 7.3 ± .7% (56 ± 16 mmol/mol); mean ± SD) from 11 SWEET centers in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Greece, France, India, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Sweden participated to the challenge. Five participants were on CSII, six on MDI; all were wearing a continuous glucose monitoring system. The glycemic targets during trekking were defined as 80-180 mg/dl (4.4-10 mmol/l). All participants completed the challenge. In total, the group walked 54.5 km under varying climate conditions (temperature 14-35 °C). During the challenge, insulin requirements decreased significantly compared to baseline: total daily insulin by 31.1 ± 16.7% (p &lt; .001), basal by 30.8 ± 14.9% (p &lt; .001), and prandial by 32.5 ± 28.0% (p = .023), with no differences between participants with CSII or MDI. No episode of severe hypoglycemia or DKA occurred. Mean glucose levels were 170.7 ± 60.1 mg/dl with 61.5 ± 18.7% of CGM values in the target range, 5.4 ± 5.4% under 80 mg/dl and 32.8 ± 16.6% above 180 mg/dl. The results of this SWEET Initiative activity demonstrated that well-educated adolescents and young adults with T1D using modern insulin treatments are able to perform successfully even extraordinary physical challenges while maintaining good glycemic control without diabetes-related acute complications."

"In adults, adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been inversely associated with cardiovascular risk, but the extent to which diet in pregnancy is associated with offspring adiposity is unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between adherence to Mediterranean diet in pregnancy and offspring cardiometabolic traits in two pregnancy cohorts. We studied 997 mother-child pairs from Project Viva in Massachusetts, USA, and 569 pairs from the Rhea study in Crete, Greece. We estimated adherence to the Mediterranean diet with an a priori defined score (MDS) of nine foods and nutrients (0 to 9). We measured child weight, height, waist circumference, skin-fold thicknesses, blood pressure, and blood levels of lipids, c-reactive protein and adipokines in mid-childhood (median 7.7 years) in Viva, and in early childhood (median 4.2 years) in Rhea. We calculated cohort-specific effects and pooled effects estimates with random-effects models for cohort and child age. In Project Viva, the mean (SD, standard deviation) MDS was 2.7 (1.6); in Rhea it was 3.8 (1.7). In the pooled analysis, for each 3-point increment in the MDS, offspring BMI z-score was lower by 0.14 units (95% CI, -0.15 to -0.13), waist circumference by 0.39 cm (95% CI, -0.64 to -0.14), and the sum of skin-fold thicknesses by 0.63 mm (95% CI, -0.98 to -0.28). We also observed lower offspring systolic (-1.03 mmHg; 95% CI, -1.65 to -0.42) and diastolic blood pressure (-0.57 mmHg; 95% CI, -0.98 to -0.16). Greater adherence to Mediterranean diet during pregnancy may protect against excess offspring cardiometabolic risk."

Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) regulates type I interferon (IFN)-responsive genes, and has been one of the most consistently associated genes with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We sought to investigate whether IRF5 haplotypes are associated with risk for SLE in the genetically homogeneous Greek population of the island of Crete, as well as whether these haplotypes are associated with increased type I IFN. 322 SLE patients and 247 healthy controls from Crete were genotyped for rs2004640, rs3807306, rs10488631 and rs2280714 SNPs of IRF5 gene by using Taqman primer-probe sets. Type I IFN levels were measured using a functional reporter cell assay. All IRF5 SNPs examined were found to be associated with SLE in univariate case-control analysis. The 4 SNPs formed 5 major haplotypes and the Neanderthal-derived TACA risk haplotype was present in Crete and enriched in the SLE cases (OR=2.01, P=0.0003). Serum IFN levels were measured in a subset of the SLE patients, and carriage of the TACA haplotype was associated with higher circulating type I IFN levels (P=0.037). This study demonstrates the association of IRF5 with an increased susceptibility for SLE in the population of Crete and emphasizes the association of the Neanderthal-derived IRF5 haplotype with SLE susceptibility. Patients carrying allele the Neanderthal allele C had greater type I IFN, supporting a functional consequence of this polymorphism.

Various physical attributes of the Earth's surface are factors that influence local topography and indirectly influence human behaviour in terms of habitation locations. The determination of geomorphological setting plays an important role in archaeological landscape research. Several landform types can be distinguished by characteristic geomorphic attributes that portray the landscape surrounding a settlement and influence its ability to sustain a population. Geomorphometric landform information, derived from digital elevation models (DEMs), such as the ASTER Global DEM, can provide useful insights into the processes shaping landscapes. This work examines the influence of landform classification on the settlement locations of Bronze Age (Minoan) Crete, focusing on the districts of Phaistos, Kavousi and Vrokastro. The landform classification was based on the topographic position index (TPI) and deviation from mean elevation (DEV) analysis to highlight slope steepness of various landform classes, characterizing the surrounding landscape environment of the settlements locations. The outcomes indicate no interrelationship between the settlement locations and topography during the Early Minoan period, but a significant interrelationship exists during the later Minoan periods with the presence of more organised societies. The landform classification can provide insights into factors favouring human habitation and can contribute to archaeological predictive modelling.

"Data on Citrobacter spp. susceptibility are scarce. We sought to study the evolution in the susceptibility of 385 Citrobacter spp. at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece during a six-year period (2010-2015). Non-duplicate strains isolated from inpatients (intensive care unit, oncology, surgery, internal medicine, paediatrics) and outpatients were studied using Vitek 2. Phenotypic confirmatory tests were applied for detection of β-lactamases and aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. C. freundii (172, 44.7%) and C. koseri (166, 43.1%) were the most commonly isolated species. C. braakii (34), C. amalonaticus (6), C. youngae (6) and C. sedlakii (1) were the remaining isolates. Colistin and fosfomycin were the most active antibiotics (both 99.2%) followed by carbapenems (99%) aminoglycosides (96.6-98.4%), tigecycline (96.1%), cefepime (94.8%), ciprofloxacin (94.3%), tetracycline (92.7%), trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (91.4%), chloramphenicol (88.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (86.5%) and 3rd generation cephalosporins (85.7%). C. freundii were more resistant than C. koseri. Antibiotic resistance did not increase during the study period for most antibiotics. Lower susceptibility to all antibiotics was observed among multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains. AmpC was the most common resistant mechanism (10.9%); carbapenemases (1.3%) and aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (2.9%) were also detected. All AmpC producers were resistant to cephalosporins but not to carbapenems. In all but one isolates aminoglycoside resistance was accompanied by acquired β-lactamases. Although Citrobacter species in general were susceptible, antibiotic susceptibility testing is required for the detection of resistant isolates."

"	"In an analysis of the population genetics of the tiny meiofaunal polychaete Hesionides gohari, the RAPD-PCR method was applied to 49 specimens from 7 collecting sites far apart on three continents: French Atlantic coast, Mediterranean (Majorca, Giglio, Crete), Red Sea, Indian Ocean (Phuket), and U.S. Atlantic coast (Florida). In the band patterns produced with 14 arbitrary decamer primers, 496 genetic characters were detected. Genetic distances between the H. gohari populations vary between 0.55 and 0.70. The data were evaluated by three cluster programs; in the almost congruent phenograms, three clades were found with high bootstrap values: (1) European Atlantic-Mediterranean-Red Sea, (2) Indian Ocean, (3) Western Atlantic. In all cluster analyses, Hesionides riegerorum from a U.S. east coast river system is shown as genetically nearest to the Florida specimens of H. gohari, making it most probable that this freshwater species of the genus originated from a Western Atlantic H. gohari population. The genetic distances detected between the H. gohari specimens from the three continents are almost identical to those found between morphologically similar interstitial polychaete species pairs. Thus, the degree of genetic consistency is considered not to be high enough to corroborate the notion of a cosmopolitan distribution pattern, but rather suggests that the three clades represent different species."

"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of temporary loop ligation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta for control of intraoperative blood loss in patients with pernicious placenta previa.  Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 14 patients with pernicious placenta previa, who underwent temporary loop ligation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta for control of blood loss during cesarean section between July 2013 and December 2014.  Results: Eight patients received conservative management to preserve the uterus and 6 patients underwent cesarean hysterectomy. The occlusion time of the abdominal aorta was (31.42±12.67) min. The average estimated intraoperative blood loss was (1 117.85±745.13) mL. The volume of packed red blood cell transfusion was (3.91±3.24) units, and the volume of fresh frozen plasma transfusion was (192.85±156.71) mL. Post-operative histologic diagnosis revealed 6 cases of placenta percreta, 4 of increta, 3 of accreta and 1 non-creta. All patients experienced an uneventful postoperative recovery.  Conclusion: In patients with pernicious placenta previa, temporary ligation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta provide a safe and effective means for controlling intraoperative hemorrhage during cesarean section. Additionally, the procedure may provide an opportunity to preserve fertility by avoiding a cesarean hysterectomy."

"Early-life exposures are critical for later child cognitive development. McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA) were used to assess cognitive development of 700 preschoolers (M<sub>age</sub>  = 4.2 years), derived from the ""Rhea"" birth cohort, in Greece. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on prospectively collected exposure data. Six components were extracted; five of them were associated with child cognition. Higher parental social status, preschool attendance and less TV watching, nonsmoking during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and parental involvement in child life were protective factors of child cognition at 4 years. Increased child birth order was negatively associated with child cognition. Offspring's size at birth was not associated with any cognitive outcome. These findings reveal the importance of early-life exposures to child cognitive development."

It is critical for managers to understand how attitudes and demography affect public's preferences for species protection for designing successful conservation projects. 1080 adults in Greece were asked to rate pictures of 12 endangered species on aesthetic and negativistic attitudes, and intention to support their conservation. Factor analysis identified a group of animals for which respondents indicated high levels of support for their conservation (red deer, loggerhead sea turtle, brown bear, common pheasant, European ground squirrel, glossy ibis) and a group of animals for which respondents indicated low levels of support (black vulture, great white shark, fire-bellied toad, western barbastelle, Cretan tube web spider, Milos viper). The species that received the highest support were also rated as the most attractive and safest, excluding the fearsome brown bear. Structural models revealed that aesthetic, moralistic and negativistic attitudes were the stronger predictors of support. Aesthetic and moralistic attitudes were positively, and negativistic attitudes negatively, correlated with support for conservation in both groups. Consumptive users scored lower in aesthetics and were less supportive of protection in the high support group, while nonconsumptive users showed the opposite trend. Respondents residing in urban areas deemed animals of high support more attractive and less fearsome and were more supportive of conservation than rural residents in both groups. Females of higher education viewed animals of low support as fearsome, however they supported their conservation. Our study identified popular species that can be used as flagship species to facilitate the implementation of conservation projects. The results of this study could also be used to design a communication and outreach campaign to raise awareness about the ecosystem value of less attractive species.

"Poor perinatal maternal mental health has been linked with negative outcomes on early child development; however, the importance of maternal personality has been neglected thus far. We aimed to examine the effects of antenatal and postnatal maternal mental health, including assessment of maternal personality characteristics, on child neuropsychological and behavioral development at preschool years in a population based mother-child cohort (Rhea Study) in Crete, Greece. Self-reported measures of maternal depression (EPDS), trait anxiety (STAI-Trait) and personality traits (EPQ-R) were assessed in a sample of 288 women at 28-32 weeks of gestation. A larger sample of 642 mothers completed the EPDS scale at 8 weeks postpartum. Children's neuropsychological (MSCA) and behavioral (ADHDT and SDQ) development were assessed at 4 years of age. Linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations between the exposures and outcomes of interest after adjustment for potential confounders. Regarding child neuropsychological development, increased postnatal depressive symptoms were associated with child's perceptual performance, whereas increased maternal psychoticism was linked with child's motor ability at 4 years of age. Furthermore, elevated levels of maternal depression during pregnancy and postpartum, and the predisposing personality characteristics of trait anxiety and neuroticism, were associated with children's behavioral difficulties. A clinical diagnostic instrument for maternal mental health was not used and assessment of children's behavior was based on maternal report. These findings suggest that poor perinatal maternal mental health and an adverse personality profile may be associated with impaired child neuropsychological and behavioral development at preschool years."

"Viruses that affect the health of humans and farm animals can spread over long distances via atmospheric mechanisms. The phenomenon of atmospheric long-distance dispersal (LDD) is associated with severe consequences because it may introduce pathogens into new areas. The introduction of new pathogens to Israel was attributed to LDD events numerous times. This provided the motivation for this study which is aimed to identify all the locations in the eastern Mediterranean that may serve as sources for pathogen incursion into Israel via LDD. This aim was achieved by calculating source-receptor relationship probability maps. These maps describe the probability that an infected vector or viral aerosol, once airborne, will have an atmospheric route that can transport it to a distant location. The resultant probability maps demonstrate a seasonal tendency in the probability of specific areas to serve as sources for pathogen LDD into Israel. Specifically, Cyprus' season is the summer; southern Turkey and the Greek islands of Crete, Karpathos and Rhodes are associated with spring and summer; lower Egypt and Jordan may serve as sources all year round, except the summer months. The method used in this study can easily be implemented to any other geographic region. The importance of this study is the ability to provide a climatologically valid and accurate risk assessment tool to support long-term decisions regarding preparatory actions for future outbreaks long before a specific outbreak occurs.

"Quality of life (QoL) assessment contributes to the better care of cancer patients. The aim of the study was to determine QoL among treated patients with advanced cancer (ACPs) in the island of Crete, Greece, their satisfaction with the given care and to evaluate possible differences in QoL between in- and day care clinic patients. The QoL of 95 Greek ACPs with breast, lung, and colon cancer were evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3), and its Breast (QLQ-BR23) and Lung (QLQ-LC13) Cancer modules, while their satisfaction with the given care was evaluated with a 10-point questionnaire. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess associations of QoL with patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. Patients reported moderate global health status/QoL (62.6) and higher cognitive, physical, and emotional scores (75.4, 66.8, and 66.6 respectively). In symptoms scales/items, all patients had mean scores &lt;50 while higher mean scores were observed for fatigue (41.8) and dyspnea (36.2). No significant differences in functioning and symptoms scales were found between different cancer types. Sexual functioning in QLQ-BR23 and alopecia in QLQ-LC13 severely affected QoL. Hospitalized patients reported worse mean global QoL than those visiting the day care clinic (55.6 versus 67.6, p =0.017), as well as in all parameters described by QLQ-C30. Most patients were satisfied with the given care (≥8/10, 74.2% of patients). ACPs in the present study were found to have an overall good QoL, functioning, and symptoms scores and were satisfied with the given care. Fatigue, dyspnea, alopecia, and sexual dysfunction were found to be among the most frequently reported distressing symptoms. Hippokratia 2016, 20(2): 139-145."

A dislodgeable foliar residue study was conducted in greenhouse pepper and tomato on the island of Crete, Greece, following the spray application of an SC insecticide (with active substance (a.s.) tebufenozide) and an EC fungicide (a.s. bupirimate). Furthermore, for the assessment of worker exposure to pesticides - as a result of re-entering the treated crops - a worker dermal exposure study was carried out during the tasks of tying or pruning, which allowed the transfer coefficient values for the specific tasks to be determined. Pesticide residues were analysed with an in house developed and fully validated HPLC-ESI/MS analytical method. The results from the study resulted in transfer coefficient values which were in agreement with current EFSA guideline values in most of the cases with the exception of bupirimate in a tomato greenhouse. In that case, high potential dermal exposure and low dislodgeable foliar residue values were observed, which is thought to be due to the moist leaves collected during sampling and monitoring, which led to greater than expected transfer coefficient values.

Lipomas of the sigmoid colon are rare entities. The present case describes a 27-year-old Caucasian woman who underwent a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy following the detection of a giant lipoma. The young patient was referred to the Emergency Department of the University Hospital of Heraklion (Crete, Greece) in May 2013 after experiencing intermittent abdominal cramping during defecation, and altering episodes of diarrhea and constipation. In addition, the patient described the protrusion of a solid tissue mass shaped like a 'champagne bottle cork' from the anus following defecation. These symptoms had been present for 1 month prior to referral. Physical examination was unremarkable. An urgent colonoscopy revealed a polypoid lesion measuring 2.5 cm in diameter in the sigmoid colon, which was located ~12 cm above the anal ring, with a smooth surface and tissue fragility. Tissue samples were obtained and sent for histopathological analysis. Preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed urgently and confirmed the presence of a solid mass in the sigmoid colon without enlargement of regional lymph nodes. Following adequate preparation, the patient underwent a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with intracorporeal termino-terminal colorectal anastomosis, with the use of a circular stapler. The patient had a positive post-operative outcome without complications and was discharged on day 4 post-surgery in an optimal condition. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen demonstrated a pedunculated lipoma shaped like a 'champagne bottle cork'. The tumor consisted of mature adipose cells. The overlying colonic mucosa showed hyperplastic crypts with regenerative changes. In the lamina propria mild inflammatory infiltration was observed. At 2 years post-surgery, the patient remains asymptomatic without any clinical evidence of recurrence.
PMID:28462018	Loudová M, Kryštufek B, Lymberakis P, Sándor AD, Hulva P	PeerJ. 5:e3163	2017	Glacial allopatry vs. postglacial parapatry and peripatry: the case of hedgehogs. 	Although hedgehogs are well-known examples of postglacial recolonisation, the specific processes that shape their population structures have not been examined by detailed sampling and fast-evolving genetic markers in combination with model based clustering methods. This study aims to analyse the impacts of isolation within glacial refugia and of postglacial expansion on the population structure of the Northern White-breasted hedgehog (<i>Erinaceus roumanicus</i>). It also discusses the role of the processes at edges of species distribution in its evolutionary history. The maternally inherited mitochondrial control region and the bi-parentally inherited nuclear microsatellites were used to examine samples within the Central Europe, Balkan Peninsula and adjacent islands. Bayesian coalescent inference and neutrality tests proposed a recent increase in the population size. The most pronounced pattern of population structure involved differentiation of the insular populations in the Mediterranean Sea and the population within the contact zone with <i>E. europaeus</i> in Central Europe. An interspecies hybrid was detected for the first time in Central Europe. A low genetic diversity was observed in Crete, while the highest genetic distances among individuals were found in Romania. The recent population in the post-refugial area related to the Balkan Peninsula shows a complex pattern with pronounced subpopulations located mainly in the Pannonian Basin and at the Adriatic and Pontic coasts. Detailed analyses indicate that parapatry and peripatry may not be the only factors that limit range expansion, but also strong microevolutionary forces that may change the genetic structure of the species. Here we present evidence showing that population differentiation may occur not only during the glacial restriction of the range into the refugia, but also during the interglacial range expansion. Population differentiation at the Balkan Peninsula and adjacent regions could be ascribed to diversification in steppe/forest biomes and complicated geomorphology, including pronounced geographic barriers as Carpathians.

"The studies on the prevalence of dementia, depression, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Greece are sparse and show major variations of prevalence depending on geographical areas, nutritional habits, and the way of living. The aim of this door-to-door study was to find the prevalence of dementia, depression, and MCI in a rural Greek population. Four hundred and forty-three individuals older than 61years following the application of specific criteria were diagnosed with: normal cognition, depression, MCI with and without depression, and dementia with and without depression. Four diagnostic methods were used, 2 of which included Mungas correction for age and education. After Mungas adjustment, the results were as follows-depression: 33.9%; MCI: 15.3%; MCI with depression: 8.6%; dementia: 2.0%; and dementia with depression: 7.2%. Dementia is less prevalent compared to global data and other Greek areas. Mild cognitive impairment is more prevalent than dementia. High percentages of depression may be related to low education."

No sequential long-term data exist for Greece on the etiological evolution and incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we studied their etiological evolution over a period of 25 years in the island of Crete. We studied 812 cases of cirrhosis (561 male, median age 69 years) and 321 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (234 male, median age 70 years) from the database of our Center. Cases were classified into five-year periods according to incidence and etiology (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcohol, alcohol plus viral, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). Overall, there was an increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. A significant fourfold reduction in the incidence of hepatitis C-related cirrhosis was observed, which was degraded from first to third place as a risk factor for cirrhosis. Alcohol gradually became the first risk factor in cirrhosis (1990-94: 36.1%, 2010-14: 52.3%) and carcinoma, while the steepest increase in incidence of cirrhosis and carcinoma was associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The incidence of cirrhosis remained constant over the years, but the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma increased during the last decade. Risk factors for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma have changed over the past 25 years in Crete. The initial high hepatitis C virus association has significantly decreased, with alcohol now ranking first among risk factors.

We investigate the sensitivity of the relict, endemic Cretan tree species Zelkova abelicea (Lam.) Boiss. (Ulmaceae) to several climate variables (temperature, precipitation and drought). For this purpose, we establish the first centennial tree-ring chronology for the species, and the first ever tree-ring chronology for a broadleaved species on Crete. We demonstrate the strong sensitivity of Z. abelicea towards precipitation and drought in late spring to early summer and the absence of a significant response to abundant precipitation occurring during winter or early spring. Whereas the late spring sensitivity is strong and consistent through time, the species seems to be experiencing a loss of signal towards early summer conditions since the 1970s, interpreted as an earlier cessation of cambial activity due to the increase in summer drought conditions on Crete. However, despite a reduced vegetative period, no significant decrease in radial growth of Z. abelicea was observed in the tree-ring series for the last decades, thus highlighting the capacity of Z. abelicea to withstand changing environmental conditions.

"To study the evolution in the susceptibility of Enterobacter spp. in Crete, Greece from 2010 to 2015. Non-duplicate isolates were studied using automated systems. Phenotypic confirmatory tests were applied. A total of 939 Enterobacter isolates were included. Colistin was the most active antibiotic (97.9%) followed by imipenem (96.1%), gentamicin (95.7%), tigecycline (91.8%), cefepime (89.4%), chloramphenicol (85.8%), fosfomycin (85.5%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (83.3%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (73.3%). Antibiotic resistance did not increase during the study period for most antibiotics. Lower susceptibility was observed among multidrug-resistant strains and carbapenem-nonsusceptible isolates. AmpC was the most common resistant mechanism (21%); carbapenemases (3.7%) and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (6.5%) were also detected. A significant proportion of Enterobacter spp. was resistant to several antibiotics, most notably β-lactams."

"Next-generation association studies can be empowered by sequence-based imputation and by studying founder populations. Here we report ∼9.5 million variants from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of a Cretan-isolated population, and show enrichment of rare and low-frequency variants with predicted functional consequences. We use a WGS-based imputation approach utilizing 10,422 reference haplotypes to perform genome-wide association analyses and observe 17 genome-wide significant, independent signals, including replicating evidence for association at eight novel low-frequency variant signals. Two novel cardiometabolic associations are at lead variants unique to the founder population sequences: chr16:70790626 (high-density lipoprotein levels beta -1.71 (SE 0.25), P=1.57 × 10<sup>-11</sup>, effect allele frequency (EAF) 0.006); and rs145556679 (triglycerides levels beta -1.13 (SE 0.17), P=2.53 × 10<sup>-11</sup>, EAF 0.013). Our findings add empirical support to the contribution of low-frequency variants in complex traits, demonstrate the advantage of including population-specific sequences in imputation panels and exemplify the power gains afforded by population isolates."

Micro or macro-level mapping of cancer statistics is a challenging task that requires long-term planning, prospective studies and continuous monitoring of all cancer cases. The objective of the current study is to present how cancer registry data could be processed using data mining techniques in order to improve the statistical analysis outcomes. Data were collected from the Cancer Registry of Crete in Greece (counties of Rethymno and Lasithi) for the period 1998-2004. Data collection was performed on paper forms and manually transcribed to a single data file, thus introducing errors and noise (e.g. missing and erroneous values, duplicate entries etc.). Data were pre-processed and prepared for analysis using data mining tools and algorithms. Feature selection was applied to evaluate the contribution of each collected feature in predicting patients' survival. Several classifiers were trained and evaluated for their ability to predict survival of patients. Finally, statistical analysis of cancer morbidity and mortality rates in the two regions was performed in order to validate the initial findings. Several critical points in the process of data collection, preprocessing and analysis of cancer data were derived from the results, while a road-map for future population data studies was developed. In addition, increased morbidity rates were observed in the counties of Crete (Age Standardized Morbidity/Incidence Rates ASIR= 396.45 ± 2.89 and 274.77 ±2.48 for men and women, respectively) compared to European and world averages (ASIR= 281.6 and 207.3 for men and women in Europe and 203.8 and 165.1 in world level). Significant variation in cancer types between sexes and age groups (the ratio between deaths and reported cases for young patients, less than 34 years old, is at 0.055 when the respective ratio for patients over 75 years old is 0.366) was also observed. This study introduced a methodology for preprocessing and analyzing cancer data, using a combination of data mining techniques that could be a useful tool for other researchers and further enhancement of the cancer registries.

"The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate endometriosis in adolescent and young girls and further to review the menstrual, reproductive characteristics, and risk factors. We reviewed the medical records of adolescent and young girls with endometriosis from 2 different countries. Data were collected and analyzed from charts of 900 patients with endometriosis. Fifty-five female adolescents aged between 13 and 21 years (mean age 18.3 years) participated in our series. This study was conducted in the Obstetric and Gynecology Department of Venizeleio General Hospital of Crete and involved all patients diagnosed with endometriosis between 1996 and 2016. Statistical methods included χ<sup>2</sup> and Mann-Whitney U test. Of 900 patients with endometriosis we found 55 female adolescents (6.1%). The mean age was 18.3 ± 2.3 years, significantly younger compared with the advanced endometriosis patients (32.7 ± 7.2; P &lt; .001). Regarding the menstrual reproductive and others characteristics, we observed several differences in adolescent young girls compared with the advanced age endometriosis group. The factors associated with an increased risk for young women include age at menarche, dysmenorrhea, history of asthma, and a positive family history of endometriosis. Additionally, we report on 16 of 55 (32%) adolescent women with endometriosis and congenital malformations (P &lt; .01) and 5 patients who were diagnosed with dry eye syndrome. There is an association between endometriosis in adolescent and young women and risk factors including early menarche, early onset of dysmenorrhea, history of asthma, previous surgical procedures, obstructive genital anomalies, and family history of endometriosis."

Recent findings encourage the use of halophytes in constructed wetlands for domestic wastewater treatment due to their special physiological characteristics as the ability to accumulate heavy metals and salts in their tissues makes them ideal candidates for constructed wetland vegetation. In this particular study, we investigated the application of halophytic plants in a horizontal flow constructed wetland for domestic wastewater treatment purposes. The pilot plant which was situated in Crete (Greece) was planted with a polyculture of halophytes (Tamarix parviflora, Juncus acutus, Sarcocornia perrenis, and Limoniastrum monopetalum). The system's performance was monitored for a period of 11 months during which it received primary treated wastewater from the local wastewater treatment plant. Results show that halophytes developed successfully in the constructed wetland and achieved organic matter and pathogen removal efficiencies comparable to those reported for reeds in previous works (63% and 1.6 log units, respectively). In addition, boron concentration in the effluent was reduced by 40% in comparison with the influent. Salinity as expressed by electrical conductivity did not change during the treatment, indicating that the accumulation of salts in the leaves is not able to overcome electrical conductivity increasing due to evapotranspiration. The results indicate an improvement in the treatment of domestic wastewater via the use of halophyte-planted CWs.

"The land snail genus Albinaria exhibits an extreme degree of morphological differentiation in Greece, especially in the island of Crete. Twenty-six representatives of 17 nominal species and a suspected hybrid were examined by sequence analysis of a PCR-amplified mitochondrial DNA fragment of the large rRNA subunit gene. Maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining phylogenetic analyses demonstrate a complex pattern of speciation and differentiation and suggest that Albinaria species from Crete belong to at least three distinct monophyletic groups, which, however, are not monophyletic with reference to the genus as a whole. There is considerable variation of genetic distance within and among ""species"" and groups. The revealed phylogenetic relations do not correlate well with current taxonomy, but exhibit biogeographical coherence. Certain small- and large-scale vicariance events can be traced, although dispersal and parapatric speciation may also be present. Our analysis suggests that there was an early and rapid differentiation of Albinaria groups across the whole of the range followed by local speciation events within confined geographical areas."

"The amount of gene flow among local populations partly determines the relative importance of genetic drift and natural selection in the differentiation of such populations. Land snails, because of their limited powers for dispersal, may be particularly likely to show such differentiation. In this study, we directly estimate gene flow in Albinaria corrugata, a sedentary, rock-dwelling gastropod from Crete, by mark-recapture studies. In the same area, 23 samples were taken and studied electrophoretically for six polymorphic enzyme loci. The field studies indicate that the population structure corresponds closely to the stepping-stone model: demes are present on limestone boulders that are a few meters apart, and dispersal takes place mainly between adjacent demes. Average deme size (N) is estimated at 29 breeding individuals and the proportion of migrants per generation at 0.195 (Nm = 5.7). We find no reason to assume long-distance dispersal, apart from dispersal along occasional stretches of suitable habitat. Genetic subdivision of the population, as derived from F<sub>ST</sub> values, corresponds to the direct estimate only at the lowest spatial level (distance between sample sites &lt; 10 m), where values for Nm of 5.4 and 17.6 were obtained. In contrast, at the larger spatial scales, F<sub>ST</sub> values give gene-flow estimates that are incompatible with the expected amount of gene flow at these scales. We explain these discrepancies by arguing that gene flow is in fact extremely limited, making correct estimates of Nm from F<sub>ST</sub> impossible at the larger spatial scales. In view of these low levels of gene flow, it is concluded that both genetic drift and natural selection may play important roles in the genetic differentiation of this species, even at the lowest spatial scales."

A one-dimensional acoustic resonator technique was used to study leaves of the Mediterranean seagrass species Posidonia oceanica collected from Crete and Sicily. The leaf blades were finely divided, mixed with artificial seawater, and degassed to create a suspension of tissue independent of leaf structure and free bubbles or internal voids. The low-frequency (1 to 8 kHz) bulk modulus of the leaf tissue was inferred from the acoustic measurements and independent density measurements. The measured density of the seagrass tissue was 960 ± 20 kg/m<sup>3</sup> which agrees with previously published values. The inferred bulk modulus was 2.1 GPa with 90% confidence limits 1.0-5.0 GPa.

Placenta accreta spectrum is a complex obstetric complication associated with high maternal morbidity. It is a relatively new disorder of placentation, and is the consequence of damage to the endometrium-myometrial interface of the uterine wall. When first described 80 years ago, it mainly occurred after manual removal of the placenta, uterine curettage, or endometritis. Superficial damage leads primarily to an abnormally adherent placenta, and is diagnosed as the complete or partial absence of the decidua on histology. Today, the main cause of placenta accreta spectrum is uterine surgery and, in particular, uterine scar secondary to cesarean delivery. In the absence of endometrial reepithelialization of the scar area the trophoblast and villous tissue can invade deeply within the myometrium, including its circulation, and reach the surrounding pelvic organs. The cellular changes in the trophoblast observed in placenta accreta spectrum are probably secondary to the unusual myometrial environment in which it develops, and not a primary defect of trophoblast biology leading to excessive invasion of the myometrium. Placenta accreta spectrum was separated by pathologists into 3 categories: placenta creta when the villi simply adhere to the myometrium, placenta increta when the villi invade the myometrium, and placenta percreta where the villi invade the full thickness of the myometrium. Several prenatal ultrasound signs of placenta accreta spectrum were reported over the last 35 years, principally the disappearance of the normal uteroplacental interface (clear zone), extreme thinning of the underlying myometrium, and vascular changes within the placenta (lacunae) and placental bed (hypervascularity). The pathophysiological basis of these signs is due to permanent damage of the uterine wall as far as the serosa, with placental tissue reaching the deep uterine circulation. Adherent and invasive placentation may coexist in the same placental bed and evolve with advancing gestation. This may explain why no single, or set combination of, ultrasound sign(s) was found to be specific for the depth of abnormal placentation, and accurate for the differential diagnosis between adherent and invasive placentation. Correlation of pathological and clinical findings with prenatal imaging is essential to improve screening, diagnosis, and management of placenta accreta spectrum, and standardized protocols need to be developed.

Under conditions of high demand for primary care services in a setting of low financial resources, there is need for brief, easily administered cognitive screening tools for use in the primary care setting, especially in rural areas. However, interpretation of these cognitive tests' results requires knowledge on their susceptibility to cultural, educational and demographic patient characteristics. To assess the clinical validity of the 'Test Your Memory' (TYM) and 'General Practitioner assessment of Cognition' (GPCog) which was specifically designed for primary care practice, in a rural primary care setting in Greece, utilizing the 'Mini Mental State Examination' (MMSE) as a reference standard. The MMSE, TYM, and GPCog were administered to a random sample of 319 community dwelling Greek adults aged 60 to 89 years in 11 rural Primary Healthcare Centres of the Prefecture of Heraklion on the island of Crete, Greece. Analyses examined (a) The association of each instrument with demographic factors and MMSE and (b) optimal cut-off scores, sensitivity and specificity against MMSE-based cognitive impairment risk using ROC analyses with the MMSE 23/24 point cut-off as a reference standard. We found a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 77% for TYM (35/36 or 38/39 cut-off, depending on education). Corresponding values were 89% and 61% for GPCog (7/8 cut-off), respectively. The TYM and GPCog instruments appear to be suitable for routine use in the primary care setting as tools for cognitive impairment risk detection in elderly rural populations.

"Sharp-force trauma is a popular cause of homicide and suicide in many countries. Characterisation of the injuries between the two is crucial for a differential diagnosis. The current paper reviews 12 self-inflicted sharp-force trauma deaths from the island of Crete in Greece. Forensic reports between 1999 and 2015 were collated, and we studied the number and location of injuries, the demographic characteristics of the deceased, the sharp object and the medical history of the deceased. One third of the cases where the forensic reports were available (3/10) involved multiple injuries, and one case involved a combination of stabbing and hanging. Most injuries involved a kitchen knife. Ninety-two per cent (11/12) of the victims involved male Greek nationals aged &gt;50 years. The type and location of injuries were not found to be specific to suicide alone. Thus, death-scene investigation remains crucial to the differential diagnosis between suicide and homicide. This is the first report on self-inflicted sharp-force fatalities in Greece."

Three separate collections of plants from Crete, Greece, and Sicily, Italy were investigated. A high consistency in effective sound speed was observed within each collection while a strong variability was observed between different collections. Average size, mass, and epiphytic coverage within each collection were quantified, and discoloration and stiffness are discussed qualitatively with respect to the observed acoustic variability.

"Genetics can provide invaluable information on the ancestry of the current inhabitants of Cyprus. A Y-chromosome analysis was performed to (i) determine paternal ancestry among the Greek Cypriot (GCy) community in the context of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East; and (ii) identify genetic similarities and differences between Greek Cypriots (GCy) and Turkish Cypriots (TCy). Our haplotype-based analysis has revealed that GCy and TCy patrilineages derive primarily from a single gene pool and show very close genetic affinity (low genetic differentiation) to Calabrian Italian and Lebanese patrilineages. In terms of more recent (past millennium) ancestry, as indicated by Y-haplotype sharing, GCy and TCy share much more haplotypes between them than with any surrounding population (7-8% of total haplotypes shared), while TCy also share around 3% of haplotypes with mainland Turks, and to a lesser extent with North Africans. In terms of Y-haplogroup frequencies, again GCy and TCy show very similar distributions, with the predominant haplogroups in both being J2a-M410, E-M78, and G2-P287. Overall, GCy also have a similar Y-haplogroup distribution to non-Turkic Anatolian and Southwest Caucasian populations, as well as Cretan Greeks. TCy show a slight shift towards Turkish populations, due to the presence of Eastern Eurasian (some of which of possible Ottoman origin) Y-haplogroups. Overall, the Y-chromosome analysis performed, using both Y-STR haplotype and binary Y-haplogroup data puts Cypriot in the middle of a genetic continuum stretching from the Levant to Southeast Europe and reveals that despite some differences in haplotype sharing and haplogroup structure, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots share primarily a common pre-Ottoman paternal ancestry."

During the past decade, several studies have been carried out using the calcaneus bone for sex estimation. This paper collected data using ten variables for metric characteristics of the calcaneus of 144 modern Cretans and examined their correlation with known sex. Secondly, the formulae developed by Peckmann et al. (2015) for modern Athenians was put to the test in order to investigate if it could be applied to this modern Cretan sample as well. Results showed a high correlation between the calcaneus metrics and the known sex of the individuals, however the formulae for Athenians do not seem to be suitable for the Cretans due to the high sex bias reported in this study. Thus, new standards were created for sex estimation from the calacanei in our sample. Bilateral asymmetry was noted in the majority of cases, thus formulae were developed for left, right and mean values. Maximum width (MAXW) was the variable that performed the best in the Cretan sample. Overall, the cross-validated accuracies for univariate and multivariate equations reached 84.2% with males most often correctly identified. The calcaneus was proved to be useful for sex estimation in this modern Cretan population. Further work will explore the suitability of the produced standards for other regions of mainland Greece and islands.

A Hydrological Approach.	A methodology for elaborating multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 satellite images for estimating topsoil Soil Moisture Content (SMC) to support hydrological simulation studies is proposed. After pre-processing the remote sensing data, backscattering coefficient, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), thermal infrared temperature and incidence angle parameters are assessed for their potential to infer ground measurements of SMC, collected at the top 5 cm. A non-linear approach using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is tested. The methodology is applied in Western Crete, Greece, where a SMC gauge network was deployed during 2015. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation and sensitivity analysis. ANNs prove to be the most efficient in SMC estimation yielding R² values between 0.7 and 0.9. The proposed methodology is used to support a hydrological simulation with the HEC-HMS model, applied at the Keramianos basin which is ungauged for SMC. Results and model sensitivity highlight the contribution of combining Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat 8 images for improving SMC estimates and supporting hydrological studies.

Limited evidence exists on the association between exposure to Helicobacter pylori infection early in life, including fetal life, and neurodevelopment in childhood. We used prospective data on 352 mother-child pairs and cross-sectional data on 674 children to assess the association of maternal and child's H. pylori seropositivity correspondingly on child's neurodevelopment at age four in the Rhea birth cohort in Crete, Greece. Blood levels of immunoglobulin G antibodies to 12 H. pylori proteins were measured using multiplex serology. Child's neurodevelopment at age four was assessed using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Linear regression models were used to explore the associations after adjusting for potential confounders. Helicobacter pylori seroprevalence (95% CI) in cord blood, representing maternal status, was 41.5% (36.3%, 46.8%) and in 4 years old children was 6.5% (95% CI 4.8%, 8.7%). Children of H. pylori seropositive mothers had lower score in the general cognitive (-3.87, 95% CI -7.02, -0.72), verbal (-2.96, 95% CI -6.08, 0.15), perceptual performance (-3.37, 95% CI -6.60, -0.15), quantitative (-2.85, 95% CI -6.28, 0.58), and memory scale (-3.37, 95% CI -6.67, -0.07) compared to those of seronegative mothers. Seropositivity in cord blood specifically to GroEl and NapA - two of the 12 H. pylori proteins investigated - was associated with lower scores in almost all scales. At age four, H. pylori seropositive children performed worst in neurodevelopment assessment compared to their seronegative counterparts although no association reached statistically significant level. Helicobacter pylori infection in early life may be an important but preventable risk factor for poor neurodevelopment.

The accuracy of contact tonometry may be compromised in cases with disorders affecting central corneal bio-mechanical properties. This study examined the reliability of rebound tonometry (RT) on the area of corneo-scleral limbus, instead of the conventional central corneal area, and the correlation of findings with ocular biometric parameters. This is a prospective cross-sectional study performed at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Hospital of Heraklion, in Crete, Greece. Consecutive cataract surgery candidates without concomitant ocular pathology, apart from cataract, were included. RT was performed on the central cornea (central RT, CRT) as well as on the limbus and scleral spur area (limbal RT, LRT). Findings were correlated with Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) as well as axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), and corneal curvature (CC) measurements. LRT readings were significantly correlated with central CRT as well as with GAT readings, whereas respective correlations with other parameters examined were not statistically significant. LRT may be used as an alternative tool in clinical practice to determine intraocular pressure when conventional devices and techniques might be inadequate or unreliable.

A mesocosm experiment was performed to study benthic-pelagic coupling under a eutrophication gradient.

The mesocosms were 4m deep, containing 1.5m<sup>3</sup> of coastal water and, at the bottom, they included 85l of undisturbed sediment, collected from a semi-impacted area in the port of Heraklion, Crete. A eutrophication gradient was created by adding nutrients in the water column (Low and High) and the experiment lasted 58days. Water column and sediment environmental variables were measured at regular intervals. The results indicate that sedimentation caused by eutrophication in the water column affected sediment geochemical variables but in most cases a time lag was observed between the trophic status of the water column and the response of the sediment. Additionally, in the High eutrophication treatment, several fluctuations were observed and the system did not recover within the experimental duration, as opposed to the Low treatment which showed fewer fluctuations and signs of recovery.

"Animal studies suggest that prenatal vitamin D status may affect fetal brain growth. However, human studies are scarce with conflicting results. We aimed to investigate the association of maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] levels with multiple neurodevelopmental outcomes at 4 years of age. We included 487 mother-child pairs from the prospective pregnancy cohort, ""Rhea"" in Crete, Greece. Maternal serum 25(OH) D concentrations were measured at the first prenatal visit (13 ± 2.4 weeks). Cognitive functions at 4 years were assessed by means of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Behavioral difficulties were assessed by means of Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Test. Children of women in the high 25(OH) D tertile (&gt;50.7 nmol/l) had 37% decreased number of hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms (IRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.39, 0.99, p <sub>trend</sub> = 0.05) and 40% decreased number of total ADHD-like symptoms (IRR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37, 0.95, p <sub>trend</sub> = 0.03) at 4 years of age, compared to children of women in the low 25(OH) D tertile (&lt;38.4 nmol/l), after adjustment for several confounders. Similar associations were found with the hyperactivity/inattention score of the SDQ questionnaire. Children of mothers with high 25(OH) D levels had also fewer total behavioral difficulties (beta-coeff: -1.25, 95% CI -2.32, -0.19) and externalizing symptoms (beta-coeff: -0.87, 95% CI -1.58, -0.15) at preschool age. The observed associations were stronger in girls than in boys (p <sub>for interaction</sub> &lt; 0.1).

Our results suggest that high maternal vitamin D levels in early pregnancy may protect against behavioral difficulties, especially ADHD-like symptoms at preschool age."

"The increasing burden of lung cancer (LC) in Crete, Greece, has raised certain concerns about the potential association of environmental risk factors with LC. The aim of this study was to assess outdoor air pollution (OAP) and the risk for LC mortality for the first time in Crete using LC primary data. 5057 LC cases (diagnosed from 1992 to 2013) were obtained from the Cancer Registry of Crete (http://www.crc.uoc.gr) and followed up until 2014. The age-standardized incidence and mortality rates (ASIR) were calculated. Data on OAP indicators [particulate matter (PM)2.5, between 2.5 and 10 μm (PM2.5-10), PM10, PM2.5 absorbance (black carbon measure), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx)] were collected. Spatial statistics were calculated and the binary logistic regression model was constructed at α=0.05 in IBM SPSS 24 and ArcMap 10.3.1. LC in Crete accounts for 40.2 new cases/100 000/year for both sexes (ASIRmales=73.1 new cases/100 000/year; ASIRfemales=11.8 new cases/100 000/year). Annual median estimates of environmental concentrations in Crete were as follows: PM2.5=20.7 (±1.5) µg/m, PM10=38.9 (±2.5) µg/m, PM2.5-10=59.6 (±3.7) µg/m, PM2.5 absorbance=1.2 (±0.3)×10/m, NO2=15.2 (±3.8) µg/m, and NOx=20.1 (±4.9) µg/m. A statistically significant association was observed between OAP and LC mortality (mean correlation coefficient=0.75; P&lt;0.05). The highest risk for 5-year LC mortality was found in the major urban centers and several south-east and north-west rural regions of Crete (relative risk=3.2, 95% confidence interval=1.6-4.7). OAP seems to be an important determinant of LC mortality. Targeted interventions should be performed in the high-risk areas."

Chronic kidney disease is a condition that affects both the physical and mental abilities of patients. Nursing care is of pivotal importance, in particular when end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are concerned, since the quality of the provided care may severely influence the patient's quality of life. This is why it is important to explore patient experiences concerning the rendered care. However, limited up-to-date studies have addressed this issue. The aim of the present study was to stress the experiences of ESRD patients concerning the provided nursing care in the hemodialysis unit at the University Hospital in Heraklion, Crete. A qualitative methodological approach was used, based on the principles of phenomenological epistemology. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and open-ended questions were applied to record <i>how</i> patients experienced the rendered care during dialysis. The recorded data were analyzed via qualitative content analysis, which revealed three main themes: 'Physical Care', 'Psychological Support' and 'Education'. Patients' views were conceptualized into sub-themes within each main theme. The interviews revealed the varied and distinct views of ESRD patients, indicating that the rendered care should be individualized.

To study changes in the susceptibility of Serratia spp. in Crete, Greece (2010-2015). Non-duplicate isolates were examined using automated systems. Phenotypic confirmatory tests were applied. Three hundred and seventy-eight Serratia spp. were analyzed. Serratia marcescens (88.3%) was the predominant species. Fluoroquinolones (97.9%), carbapenems (97.4%) and fosfomycin (97.4%) were the most active followed by amikacin (95.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (94.7%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (94.4%). The activity of 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins was 87-88.6%. The distribution of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains varied, with a trend towards increasing frequency. ESBL (7.9%), carbapenemase (2.9%), AmpC (2.1%) and aminoglycoside modifying enzyme (10.6%) production were the commonest resistant phenotypes. The susceptibility of Serratia spp. varied during the study period a trend towards decreasing susceptibility, especially for non-carbapenem β-lactams and aminoglycosides.

"To examine and compare undergraduate healthcare students' attitudes towards people with physical or intellectual disabilities in Greece. The experience that people with disabilities have with health care is a complex interaction between their medical condition and the social and physical environment. Attitudes of the nursing and healthcare staff affect the quality of care and people's adaptation to their disability, self-image and rehabilitation outcomes. Descriptive cross-sectional survey. Nursing, Social Work and Medicine students (N = 1007, 79.4% female) attending three universities (Athens, Crete) completed during 2014-2016 two standardised scales regarding physical (ATDP-B) and intellectual disability (CLAS-ID). Descriptive and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Attitudes towards people with physical disabilities in Greece (ATDP-B scores) were poor with scores just above the mid-point. Medical studies and higher knowledge and work with individuals with physical disabilities signified marginally more positive attitudes. Gender and age displayed no associations with attitudes. Regarding intellectual disability (CLAS-ID scores), nursing students had slightly less positive attitudes in ""Similarity"" but more positive attitudes in ""Sheltering"" subscales. Previous work and contact was related to more favourable and higher age to less favourable ""Similarity"" and ""Sheltering"" attitudes. Males had higher ""Exclusion"" scores. Those who knew people with intellectual disabilities had less favourable ""Empowerment"" attitudes. Knowledge was related to more positive attitudes in all four CLAS-ID subscales. Greek health and social care students showed poor attitudes towards people with physical and intellectual disability. When holding unfavourable attitudes, healthcare professionals become less involved with the people they care for and they do not provide nursing care to the best of their abilities. Undergraduate and continuing education, along with workplace enhancements, should aim to provide high-quality health care to people with disabilities."

"Several population-based studies on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported, yet community-based, individual-case validated, comprehensive reports are missing. We studied the SLE epidemiology and burden on the island of Crete during 1999-2013. Multisource case-finding included patients ≥15 years old. Cases were ascertained by the ACR 1997, SLICC 2012 criteria and rheumatologist diagnosis, and validated through synthesis of medical charts, administrative and patient-generated data. Overall age-adjusted/sex-adjusted incidence was 7.4 (95% CI 6.8 to 7.9) per 100 000 persons/year, with stabilising trends in women but increasing in men, and average (±SD) age of diagnosis at 43 (±15) years. Adjusted and crude prevalence (December 2013) was 123.4 (113.9 to 132.9) and 143 (133 to 154)/10<sup>5</sup> (165/10<sup>5</sup> in urban vs 123/10<sup>5</sup> in rural regions, p&lt;0.001), respectively. Age-adjusted/sex-adjusted nephritis incidence was 0.6 (0.4 to 0.8) with stable trends, whereas that of neuropsychiatric SLE was 0.5 (0.4 to 0.7) per 100 000 persons/year and increasing. Although half of prevalent cases had mild manifestations, 30.5% developed organ damage after 7.2 (±6.6) years of disease duration, with the neuropsychiatric domain most frequently afflicted, and 4.4% of patients with nephritis developed end-stage renal disease. The ACR 1997 and SLICC 2012 classification criteria showed high concordance (87%), yet physician-based diagnosis occurred earlier than criteria-based in about 20% of cases. By the use of a comprehensive methodology, we describe the full spectrum of SLE from the community to tertiary care, with almost half of the cases having mild disease, yet with significant damage accrual. SLE is not rare, affects predominantly middle-aged women and is increasingly recognised in men. Neuropsychiatric disease is an emerging frontier in lupus prevention and care."

The origins of the Bronze Age Minoan and Mycenaean cultures have puzzled archaeologists for more than a century. We have assembled genome-wide data from 19 ancient individuals, including Minoans from Crete, Mycenaeans from mainland Greece, and their eastern neighbours from southwestern Anatolia. Here we show that Minoans and Mycenaeans were genetically similar, having at least three-quarters of their ancestry from the first Neolithic farmers of western Anatolia and the Aegean, and most of the remainder from ancient populations related to those of the Caucasus and Iran. However, the Mycenaeans differed from Minoans in deriving additional ancestry from an ultimate source related to the hunter-gatherers of eastern Europe and Siberia, introduced via a proximal source related to the inhabitants of either the Eurasian steppe or Armenia. Modern Greeks resemble the Mycenaeans, but with some additional dilution of the Early Neolithic ancestry. Our results support the idea of continuity but not isolation in the history of populations of the Aegean, before and after the time of its earliest civilizations.

"Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides. We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329. We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries- India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods. National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. None."

"To compare different treatment methods in the management of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) disorders. In a retrospective cohort study, medical records were retrieved for patients who underwent elective surgery at 24 weeks of pregnancy or more after a diagnosis of PAS disorder (creta, increta, or percreta) at a center in Turkey between May 2, 2010, and August 10, 2016. The final analysis included patients whose diagnosis was confirmed intraoperatively and for whom complete data were available. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1 included those who underwent hysterectomy without placental removal, group 2 included patients whose placenta was left in situ, and group 3 included those who underwent placental removal and conservative surgery. Among 79 included patients (33 creta, 18 increta, 28 percreta), 27 (34%) were in group 1, 15 (19%) in group 2, and 37 (47%) in group 3. Total blood loss and the amounts of blood products transfused were lowest in group 2; significant differences between groups were noted (all P ≤ 0.001). Surgical complication rates were similar between groups (4/27 [15%], 1/15 [7%], and 11/37 [30%], respectively; P=0.119). Overall uterine preservation rates were not significantly different between groups 2 and 3 (14/15 [93%] vs 33/37 [89%]; P&gt;0.99). Leaving the placenta in situ could become the treatment of choice for PAS disorders."

"The purpose of the study was to review patients' characteristics and the location of extrapelvic endometriosis. Out of 1000 women with endometriosis during a 20year period, we found 200 cases with extra pelvic endometriosis. Medical reports were evaluated and the diagnosis was confirmed on the pathological specimen. This study involved cases from two different geographical areas, New Haven and Crete. The age, parity, symptoms, previous surgeries, diagnostic modalities, histopathological evaluation and location of endometriotic implants found in other areas were recorded and analyzed from the patient's charts. Statistical methods included x<sup>2</sup> and Mann-Whitney U test s measuring incidence of right-VS left sided endometriosis. 200 patients with extrapelvic endometriosis and 800 patients with pelvic endometriosis were included in the study. The gastrointestinal tract represents the most common location of extrapelvic endometriosis with 104/200(52%) cases (p&lt;0, 01), followed by the urinary system with70/200(35%) cases. We observed the Left-sided ureter being involved in 49/200(24, 5%) cases, significantly higher compare with the right-sided ureter 21/100(10, 5%) (p &lt;0, 01). All women had similar characteristics involving age, weight, main complaints, age of menarche, endometriosis stages, gravid and family history of endometriosis. The gastrointestinal tract and the urinary system are the most common sites of the extrapelvic endometriosis, which was obvious in both countries. Moreover, we observed that there are no significant differences in demographic variants, menstrual and reproductive characteristics in women with extrapelvic and pelvic endometriosis."

There is evidence that genotyping for the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) gene variants is useful for the prediction of response to thiopurine analogs (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of TPMT gene polymorphisms in a genetic homogenous population of IBD patients in Crete and to correlate the results with adverse reactions to thiopurine drugs. Genotyping for the most common TPMT variants TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, TPMT3*C, and TPMT*3B was performed using the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 223 consecutive IBD patients and 119 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls. The hospital medical records were reviewed for thiopurine use in these patients and related adverse events. The prevalence of TPMT variants TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B, and TPMT*3C was 1.8, 2.7, 1.3, and 1.8%, respectively. The G238C mutation was detected in four (1.8%) out of 223 patients, three (1.3%) patients were carriers of the G460A mutation, four (1.8%) of the A719G mutation, and six (2.7%) of both G460A and A719G mutations. In healthy controls, only one (0.8%) carried both the G460A and the A719G mutation, whereas TPMT*2, TPMT*3C, and TPMT*3B were not detected. None of the genotypes was homozygous. A statistically significant correlation between the presence of the G460A mutation and the development of leucopenia after the administration of thiopurines was observed (P=0.048). This study showed a lower frequency of total TPMT variants and a higher frequency of TPMT*3B in Cretan IBD patients compared with other Caucasian populations. The presence of the G460A mutation is associated with the development of leukopenia.

Knowledge on biodiversity patterns of demersal megafaunal species in the Mediterranean and particularly in its eastern basin is still very scarce. In the present study, fine-scale diversity patterns in relation to depth were analyzed for three major megafaunal groups (fish, cephalopods and crustaceans) in three subareas of the eastern Mediterranean (Crete, Cyclades and Dodecanese islands). The analysis was based on data from the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey conducted during 2005-2014 and the relationship between depth and two different diversity measures (species richness and Shannon-Weaver) was examined using Generalized Additive Modeling (GAM) techniques. Species richness of fish decreased with depth in two of the three subareas (Cyclades, Dodecanese), while the opposite was true for crustaceans in all subareas. Cephalopods had higher species richness at intermediate depths, near the shelf break. Significant differences among subareas were found, with Crete showing a distinct species richness-depth pattern, which was more obvious for fish and cephalopods. The differences among subareas were also highlighted based on the occurrence of alien species of Indo-Pacific origin, which were more frequent in Crete. Our results suggested that the importance of depth-related factors in structuring communities was higher for cephalopods and less important for fish, and that Crete showed a distinct diversity-depth relationship, a fact that can be attributed to its specific geographical and oceanographic characteristics. These results support the current GFCM/FAO's characterization of Crete as a unique geographic subarea. The findings of the study contribute to understanding the causes of underlying diversity patterns and would assist various environmental management actions, particularly those related to the establishment of marine-protected areas.

In a study of 62 plant species of the Cretan flora for their phytotoxic activity, plants were extracted successively with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, MeOH and H<sub>2</sub>O. Phytotoxicity evaluation of the 240 extracts was performed against Lactuca sativa L. and Agrostis stolonifera L.. The MeOH extract of Bellis longifolia was the most phytotoxic. Bioassay-guided fractionation revealed that a fraction consisting mainly of saponins was the most effective. Separation of the saponins was performed using initially a step-gradient Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC). Investigation of the active fraction led to the isolation and structure elucidation of three previously undescribed triterpene saponins, 3-O-β-D-fucopyranosyl polygalacic acid, 28-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-β-D-fucopyranosyl polygalacic acid and 3-O-β-D-fucopyranosyl-2α,3β,23-trihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid, which were present as the main phytotoxic compounds of the methanol extract. Two triterpenes, polygalacic acid and bellisonic acid and four kaempferol glucosides, as well as chlorogenic acid were also isolated. 3-O-β-D-fucopyranosyl polygalacic acid and 3-O-β-D-fucopyranosyl-2α,3β,23-trihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid had phytotoxic activity similar to some commercial herbicides (IC<sub>50</sub> values of ca. 25 μM) against duckweed (Lemna paucicostata).

The Eastern Mediterranean Sea is a sink for terrigenous sediments from North Africa, Europe and Asia Minor. Its sediments therefore provide valuable information on the climate dynamics in the source areas and the associated transport processes. We present a high-resolution dataset of sediment core M40/4_SL71, which was collected SW of Crete and spans the last ca. 180 kyr. We analysed the clay mineral composition, the grain size distribution within the silt fraction, and the abundance of major and trace elements. We tested the potential of end-member modelling on these sedimentological datasets as a tool for reconstructing the climate variability in the source regions and the associated detrital input. For each dataset, we modelled three end members. All end members were assigned to a specific provenance and sedimentary process. In total, three end members were related to the Saharan dust input, and five were related to the fluvial sediment input. One end member was strongly associated with the sapropel layers. The Saharan dust end members of the grain size and clay mineral datasets generally suggest enhanced dust export into the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the dry phases with short-term increases during Heinrich events. During the African Humid Periods, dust export was reduced but may not have completely ceased. The loading patterns of two fluvial end members show a strong relationship with the Northern Hemisphere insolation, and all fluvial end members document enhanced input during the African Humid Periods. The sapropel end member most likely reflects the fixation of redox-sensitive elements within the anoxic sapropel layers. Our results exemplify that end-member modelling is a valuable tool for interpreting extensive and multidisciplinary datasets.

"The beneficial effects of traditional herbs of Crete, Greece for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections have been reported in observational and laboratory studies. Following a published, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an extract of three Cretan herbs on the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, upon its market release. An observational study was conducted in Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Participants were patients presenting at selected pharmacies with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, choosing to receive the extract for their treatment. Patients' symptoms (local, general, total) where recorded at three time points within 1 week, using a questionnaire developed based on the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory System Survey. For each patient, symptoms were scored on a 0-7 Likert scale and three indexes were calculated: the score of local symptoms, the score of general symptoms and the total score of symptoms. Effectiveness was assessed by examining the reduction in these indexes over the 1-week observation period. Mean score of general symptoms was 19.1 (SE: 0.9) in day 1, dropping to 8.6 (SE: 0.6) and 3.1 (SE: 0.4) in days 4 and 7 respectively. Mean score of local symptoms declined from 7.9 (SE: 0.5) in day 1 to 2.3 (SE: 0.3) in day 4 and to 0.5 (SE: 0.1) in day 7. Total score of symptoms reached 27.0 (SE: 1.2) in day 1, decreasing to 10.9 (SE: 0.8) in day 4 and to 3.5 (SE: 0.5) in day 7. The percentage of participants reporting fever was 82.1% at baseline, 8.0% in day 4 and 2.0% in day 7 (p &lt; 0.0001 for paired differences). Multiple regression models indicated that supplementary medication intake did not seem to affect symptoms' severity or the day patients reported that their symptoms ceased completely. This pragmatic study added evidence about the potential therapeutic effects of an extract of Cretan herbs on the amelioration of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms."

"The aims of this study were to prospectively screen cirrhotic patients with arterial blood gas test and albumin perfusion scan, identify those fulfilling the classic hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) criteria, correlate with clinical parameters, and evaluate the survival of patients with HPS compared with those without HPS in a genetically homogenous Cretan cirrhotic population. Data on consecutive 102 patients within 1 year were collected and analyzed. All patients underwent a technetium 99m-macroaggregated albumin perfusion lung scan (Tc-MAA). Diagnosis of HPS was based on the presence of the quantitative index Tc-MAA≥6% and a [P(A-a)O2]≥15 mm Hg (≥20 mm Hg for patients over &gt;64 y). In 94/102 patients, complete scintigraphic data were available. In total, 24 (26%) patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of HPS; 95.8% of them had mild-to-moderate HPS. In 8 patients the Tc-MAA scintigraphy could not be interpreted. There was no difference in HPS between decompensated (24.6%) and compensated cirrhosis (27.3%). In the multivariate analysis only the quantitative index was significant for the diagnosis of HPS (P=0.001, odds ratio; 95% confidence interval, 7.05; 2.27-21.87). Kaplan- Meier survival curves indicated a similar overall prognosis for patients diagnosed with HPS (P=0.105). HPS is a frequent complication of cirrhosis. Mild-to-moderate HPS has no significant effect on survival of cirrhotic patients. The quantitative Tc-MAA test is a reliable tool for diagnosis."

"The auricular surface is often found very well preserved, thus age-related changes in this anatomical area can be important for any set of human remains that require identification under different taphonomic conditions. This study tests the Buckberry and Chamberlain (2002) and Schmitt et al. (2005) methods in predicting the age of individuals in a documented sample from Crete, Greece. Both methods were used to record changes on the auricular surface in a mixed-sex sample of 74 individuals, directly as well as through photographs, by two independent observers. Cohen's kappa and intra class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used in order to assess inter-observer and intra-observer agreement. Results showed than none of the methods predicted age with sufficient accuracy, as high error rates were recorded. The Schmitt et al. (2005) method performed better, mainly because the age ranges it uses are broader. Scoring through photographs does not seem to introduce bias in predicting age, as demonstrated by the high intra-observer agreement rates. Inter-observer agreement was also high. The low intra- and inter-observer error rates suggest that the poor performance of both methods in the Cretan sample is not due to a lack of clarity in the description of the morphological changes recorded on the auricular surface; rather it should be attributed to a poor correlation between these changes and age at death in our material."

We studied the life history of Gagea graeca (L.) A. Terracc. (sect. Anthericoides) by field surveys on the Greek island of Crete, including quantitative analyses of 405 individuals, estimation of resource allocation by measuring the nitrogen content of different plant organs, assessing seed set and recording genetic diversity via amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses. In contrast to most species of the genus G. graeca seems to be a short-lived perennial, developing several characters that are rather typical for annual plants. Although seed set varies largely, flowering plants produce many (68 ± 79) small, flattened seeds (mean weight 73 ± 22 µg) in comparison to a single bulbil. If measured as nitrogen content of the respective plant parts, investment in seeds (25%) is much higher than that in bulbils (4%). In addition, the threshold for flower formation (expressed as bulb size where 50% of the plants form the respective structure) is with 2.17 ± 0.05 mm lower than that for bulbils with 2.80 ± 0.16 mm. This is in accordance with AFLP analyses revealing predominantly sexual reproduction (only 9.1% of 110 investigated plants belonged to clones). In the genus Gagea early, predominantly sexual reproduction seems to be characteristic for species from arid habitats, coupled with a low proportion of clonal plants.

"	In many Mediterranean islands with limited surface water resources, the growth of agricultural and touristic sectors, which are the main water consumers, highly depends on the sustainable water resources management. This work highlights the crucial role of groundwater footprint (GF) as a tool for the sustainable management of water resources, especially in water scarce islands. The groundwater footprint represents the water budget between inflows and outflows in an aquifer system and is used as an index of the effect of groundwater use in natural resources and environmental flows. The case study presented in this paper is the island of Crete, which consists of 11 main aquifer systems. The data used for estimating the groundwater footprint in each system were groundwater recharges, abstractions through 412 wells, environmental flows (discharges) from 76 springs and 19 streams present in the area of study. The proposed methodology takes into consideration not only the water quantity but also the water quality of the aquifer systems and can be used as an integrated decision making tool for the sustainable management of groundwater resources. This methodology can be applied in any groundwater system. The results serve as a tool for assessing the potential of sustainable use and the optimal distribution of water needs under the current and future climatic conditions, considering both quantitative and qualitative factors. Adaptation measures and water policies that will effectively promote sustainable development are also proposed for the management of the aquifer systems that exhibit a large groundwater footprint.

Although a number of human Legionnaires' disease in tourists are recorded annually in Europe, there are few cases where a direct link can be made between the infected person and the source of infection (hotel or other accommodation). We present a scheme followed in order to track down and identify the source of infection in a tourist suffering from L. pneumophila sg 5 infection, who was accommodated in seven different hotels during his holidays in the island of Crete, and we comment on various difficulties and draw-backs of the process. Water samples were collected from the seven hotels where the patient had resided and analyzed at the regional public health laboratory using cultivation and molecular tests. Of 103 water samples analyzed, 19 (18.4%) were positive for Legionella non-pneumophila and 8 (7.8%) were positive for L. pneumophila. A successful L. pneumophila sg 5 match was found between the clinical and environmental sample, which led us to the final identification of the liable hotel. Timely notification of the case, within the the European Legionnaires' Disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNet) of the partners involved, is crucial during a course of travel associated with Legionella case investigation. Moreover, the urinary antigen test alone cannot provide sufficient information for the source identification. However, acquiring clinical as well as environmental isolates for serogroup and SBT identification is highly important for the successful matching.

"Field and lab trials took place in Crete (July to September 2016), concerning the residual degradation and toxicity of seven active ingredients applied as bait sprays against the olive fruit fly. Highest residues were recorded in olive leaves for dimethoate and phosmet (~ 60 mg/kg) immediately after application (day 1+), while a threefold and fivefold reduction was observed 1 week later, respectively. Residues of pyrethroids were determined at lower levels (&lt; 10 mg/kg) but remained almost stable for a longer period of time. Finally, thiacloprid and spinosad residues were determined at 5.81 and 0.19 mg/kg respectively (day 1+), and rapidly decreased below the LOQ. Highest toxicity against the olive fruit fly was observed just right after the application of dimethoate (100%), a-cypermethrin (80%), and L-cyhalothrin (72.92%). Although the toxicity of dimethoate was significantly reduced 1 week after the application (80%) and then minimized, toxicity of pyrethroids remained almost stable (&gt; 60%) for the first 2 weeks and then decreased to 30-40%, which remained stable up to the end of the study (8 weeks). Concerning phosmet, its toxicity ranged from 35 to 56% for 3 weeks with no significant reduction, while spinosad presented a lower toxicity profile (50% only for 1 week). The benefits of these results in the knowledge of insecticide residues and their toxicity against olive fruit fly can be used for improving olive fruit fly control."

Plant-parasitic nematodes such as <i>Longidorus euonymus</i> and <i>Helicotylenchus multicintctus</i> are species widely distributed in central Europe as well as in Mediterranean area. In Greece, both species have been previously reported but no morphometrics or molecular data were available for these species. Nematode surveys in the rhizosphere of grapevines in Athens carried out in 2016 and 2017, yielded a <i>Longidorus</i> species identified as <i>Longidorus euonymus</i>. Similarly, a population of <i>Helicotylenchus multicinctus</i> was detected infecting banana roots from an outdoor crop in Tertsa, Crete. For both species, morphometrics and molecular data of Greek populations were provided, resulting in the first integrative identification of both nematode species based on morphometric and molecular markers, confirming the occurrence of these two nematodes in Greece as had been stated in earlier reports.

"To assess the management and maternal outcomes of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) disorders. A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients diagnosed with PAS disorders (placenta creta, increta, or percreta) who were treated at a US tertiary care center between February 1, 2011, and January 31, 2016. Obstetric management, anesthetic management, and maternal outcomes were analyzed. A total of 43 cases were identified; placenta previa was diagnosed among 33 (77%). Median age was 33 years (range 23-42). Median blood loss was 1500 mL (interquartile range 1000-2500); blood loss was greatest among the 10 patients with placenta percreta (3250 mL, interquartile range 2200-6000). Transfusion of blood products was necessary among 14 (33%) patients, with no difference in frequency according to the degree of placental invasion (P=0.107). Surgical complications occurred among 10 (23%) patients. Overall, 30 (70%) patients received combined spinal-epidural plus general anesthesia, 4 (9%) received only general anesthesia, and 9 (21%) underwent surgery with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. One patient experienced difficult airway and another experienced accidental dural puncture. Placenta previa and accreta coexist in many patients, leading to substantial bleeding related to the degree of myometrial invasion. An interdisciplinary team approach plus the use of combined spinal-epidural anesthesia, transitioning to general anesthesia, were advisable and safe."

In KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-KP), however, colistin resistance is rapidly emerging through other mechanisms. Resistance is frequently due to disruption of the mgrB gene by insertion sequences, e.g. ISL3. The aim of this study was to investigate the expansion of mgrB-mutated KPC-KP isolates. In addition, the localisation and targets of ISL3 sequences within the core and accessory genome of common KPC-KP lineages were identified. A total of 29 clinical K. pneumoniae isolates collected from Italian patients were randomly selected. Whole genome sequences were analysed for resistance genes, plasmids and insertion sequences. In addition, 27 colistin-resistant KPC-KP isolates from a previous study from Crete (Greece) were assessed. Clonal expansion of KPC-KP isolates with various mutations in mgrB among all lineages was observed. In two Italian MLST ST512 isolates and eight Greek ST258 isolates, an identical copy of ISL3 was inserted in mgrB nucleotide position 133. ISL3, a transposable restriction-modification system of 8154 nucleotides, was located on pKpQIL-like plasmids and may transpose into the chromosome. In four isolates, chromosomal integration of ISL3 in diverse inner membrane proteins other than mgrB was identified. Colistin resistance is most often explained by clonal expansion of isolates with mutated mgrB. pKpQIL-like plasmids, which are omnipresent in KPC-KP, carry insertion sequences such as ISL3 that have mgrB as a target hotspot for transposition. Transposition of insertion sequences from plasmids and subsequent clonal expansion may contribute to the emerging colistin resistance in KPC-KP.

"Tobacco dependence treatment in clinical settings is of prime public health importance, especially in Greece, a country experiencing one of the highest rates of tobacco use in Europe. Our study aimed to examine the characteristics of tobacco users and document rates of tobacco treatment delivery in general practice settings in Crete, Greece. A cross-sectional sample of patients (n = 2, 261) was screened for current tobacco use in 25 general practices in Crete, Greece in 2015/16. Current tobacco users completed a survey following their clinic appointment that collected information on patient characteristics and rates at which the primary care physician delivered tobacco treatment using the evidence-based 4 A's (Ask, Advise, Assist, Arrange) model during their medical appointment and over the previous 12-month period. Multi-level modeling was used to analyze data and examine predictors of 4 A's delivery. Tobacco use prevalence was 38% among all patients screened. A total of 840 tobacco users completed the study survey [mean age 48.0 (SD 14.5) years, 57.6% male]. Approximately, half of the tobacco users reported their general practitioner 'asked' about their tobacco use and 'advised' them to quit smoking. Receiving 'assistance' with quitting (15.7%) and 'arranging' follow-up support (&lt;3%) was infrequent. Patient education, presence of smoking-related illness, a positive screen for anxiety or depression and the type of medical appointment were associated with 4 A's delivery. Given the fundamental importance of addressing tobacco treatment, increasing the rates of 4 A's treatment in primary care settings in Greece is an important target for improving patient care."

"In this study, we reviewed demographics and biometric characteristics among patients receiving chronic β-blockers and prostaglandins (PGs) for primary open-angle glaucoma. We compared the age at the time of cataract surgery in different patient groups and in a control group which was not under any medication. Retrospective chart review of glau-comatous patients who underwent cataract extraction at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, between January 1998 and December 2016 was done. Age at cataract surgery, axial length (AL), and preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs) were recorded. A cohort of patients without glaucoma who were operated for cataract extraction was also evaluated. In all, 320 patients were reviewed. There were significant results in mean age difference between the beta-antagonist and the PG group [3.05 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-4.57] and between the beta-antagonist group with the patients receiving a combined therapy (3.02 years, 95% CI 1.14-4.91). No significant difference was found between the PG and the combination group. All the three treated groups had a significant lower mean age than the control group at the time of cataract surgery. Based on our study, we concluded that there might be a possible association between chronic treatment with beta-antagonist agents and earlier cataract surgical time in the treated eye. Intraocular pressure control is often usually achieved using ophthalmic agents. Their topical and systemic effects should be monitored precisely. Earlier cataract formation might be an important side effect which the physician has to keep in mind before choosing the suitable medication.<b>How to cite this article:</b> Bontzos G, Agiorgiotakis M, Detorakis ET.

Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma species are opportunistic pathogens associated with urogenital infections, complications during pregnancy and postpartum infections. Appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment is necessary to achieve an optimal therapeutic outcome. This study evaluated the prevalence and the antimicrobial susceptibility of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma spp. isolated from 1,008 endocervical samples of outpatients in Crete, Greece, during a five-year period (2012-2016), using the commercially available Mycoview kit (Zeakon diagnostics, France). Ureaplasma spp. was isolated from 116 patients (11.5%), M. hominis from 6 (0.6%), while coinfection with both mycoplasmas was demonstrated in 17 (1.7%). All Ureaplasma strains were susceptible to josamycin and doxycycline. Doxycycline, minocycline and ofloxacin were the most potent antibiotics against M. hominis. Docycycline was proved the most active and is still the drug of choice for the treatment of genital mycoplasma infections. Local surveillance to monitor changes in antimicrobial susceptibilities is necessary to guide treatment strategies.

Color, phenolic content, and chemical age values of red wines made from Cretan grape varieties (Kotsifali, Mandilari) were evaluated over nine months of maturation in different containers for two vintages. The wines differed greatly on their anthocyanin profiles. Mid-IR spectra were also recorded with the use of a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer in ZnSe disk mode. Analysis of Variance was used to explore the parameter's dependency on time. Determination models were developed for the chemical age indexes using Partial Least Squares (PLS) (TQ Analyst software) considering the spectral region 1830-1500 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The correlation coefficients (<i>r</i>) for chemical age index i were 0.86 for Kotsifali (Root Mean Square Error of Calibration (RMSEC) = 0.067, Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) = 0,115, and Root Mean Square Error of Validation (RMSECV) = 0.164) and 0.90 for Mandilari (RMSEC = 0.050, RMSEP = 0.040, and RMSECV = 0.089).

Different language skills are considered fundamental for successful reading and spelling acquisition. Extensive evidence has highlighted the central role of phonological awareness in early literacy experiences. However, many orthographic systems also require the contribution of morphological awareness. The goal of this study was to examine the morphological and phonological awareness skills of preschool children as longitudinal predictors of reading and spelling ability by the end of first grade, controlling for the effects of receptive and expressive vocabulary skills. At Time 1 preschool children from kindergartens in the Greek regions of Attika, Crete, Macedonia, and Thessaly were assessed on tasks tapping receptive and expressive vocabulary, phonological awareness (syllable and phoneme), and morphological awareness (inflectional and derivational). Tasks were administered through an Android application for mobile devices (tablets) featuring automatic application of ceiling rules. At Time 2 one year later the same children attending first grade were assessed on measures of word and pseudoword reading, text reading fluency, text reading comprehension, and spelling. Complete data from 104 children are available. Hierarchical linear regression and commonality analyses were conducted for each outcome variable. Reading accuracy for both words and pseudowords was predicted not only by phonological awareness, as expected, but also by morphological awareness, suggesting that understanding the functional role of word parts supports the developing phonology-orthography mappings. However, only phonological awareness predicted text reading fluency at this age. Longitudinal prediction of reading comprehension by both receptive vocabulary and morphological awareness was already evident at this age, as expected. Finally, spelling was predicted by preschool phonological awareness, as expected, as well as by morphological awareness, the contribution of which is expected to increase due to the spelling demands of Greek inflectional and derivational suffixes introduced at later grades.

"This paper proposes a method for the quantification of the shape of sexually dimorphic cranial traits, namely the glabella, mastoid process and external occipital protuberance. The proposed method was developed using 165 crania from the documented Athens Collection and tested on 20 Cretan crania. It is based on digital photographs of the lateral view of the cranium, drawing of the profile of three sexually dimorphic structures and calculation of variables that express the shape of these structures. The combinations of variables that provide optimum discrimination between sexes are identified by means of binary logistic regression and discriminant analysis. The best cross-validated results are obtained when variables from all three structures are combined and range from 75.8 to 85.1% and 81.1 to 94.6% for males and females, respectively. The success rate is 86.3-94.1% for males and 83.9-93.5% for females when half of the sample is used for training and the rest for prediction. Correct classification for the Cretan material based upon the standards developed for the Athens sample was 80-90% for the optimum combinations of discriminant variables. The proposed method provides an effective way to capture quantitatively the shape of sexually dimorphic cranial structures; it gives more accurate results relative to other existing methods and it does not require specialized equipment. Equations for sex estimation based on combinations of variables are provided, along with instructions on how to use the method and Excel macros for calculation of discriminant variables with automated implementation of the optimum equations."

Different port sectors (leisure, fishing, passenger, cargo, shipyard) and different seasons (winter, before touristic period, after touristic period) were compared. Salinity and sediment concentration of copper and antimony were the three environmental parameters most highly correlated with benthic species composition and diversity. Both the environmental variables and the benthic biodiversity patterns were significantly different between the three ports (i.e. different geographical locations). Heraklion port was heavily polluted by AHs in surface and anoxic sediments and had the highest percentage of opportunistic species, while Cagliari had the highest levels of PAHs and UCM and low species richness. El Kantaoui port was less polluted and characterised by a richer biodiversity. The shipyard sector in Heraklion port was significantly different from all other sectors in terms of abiotic and biotic parameters. Physico-chemical and pollution variables recorded during the period after tourism (late summer) were significantly different from the ones recorded in winter. Seasonal differences were not significant between benthic species diversity patterns, but were revealed when the patterns derived from the aggregation of higher taxonomic levels were compared. The present study indicates that a regular-basis monitoring plan including evaluation of environmental health based on benthic biodiversity, can provide a basis for perceiving changes and reveal the degree of anthropogenic disturbance in port environments.

To explore the experiences, needs and coping strategies of families of patients admitted to adult intensive care units. A descriptive qualitative research design was chosen using an inductive thematic content analysis approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted withfourteen family members in three hospitals of Crete. Four main themes were derived from data analysis. Our results showed that family members were in turmoil having to deal with intense and alternating feelings. The protection of patient's dignity and well-being was of utmost importance mainly by maintaining proximity. Getting comprehensible information and building communication with the healthcare providers was often problematic. Three coping strategies were used: optimism, family support and spirituality. This study is a contribution to the understanding of Greek family's experiences and psychosocial needs during critical illness. A family-inclusive framework should be promoted and implemented in intensive care recognising and supporting family's role in the patient's illness and recovery.

"Disentangling the relative roles of past fragmentation (vicariance), colonization (dispersal) and post-divergence gene flow in the genetic divergence of continental island organisms remains a formidable challenge. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used to (1) gain further insights into the biogeographical processes underlying the Pleistocene diversification of the Aegean Nigella arvensis complex; (2) evaluate the role of potential key factors driving patterns of population genetic variability (mating system, geographical isolation and historical contingencies); and (3) test the robustness of conclusions previously drawn from chloroplast (cp) DNA. Genetic diversity was analysed for 235 AFLP markers from 48 populations (497 individuals) representing 11 taxa of the complex using population genetic methods and Bayesian assignment tests. Most designated taxa are identifiable as genetically distinct units. Both fragmentation and dispersal-driven diversification processes occurred at different geological time scales, from Early to Late Pleistocene, specifically (1) sea barrier-induced vicariant speciation in the Cyclades, the Western Cretan Strait and Ikaria; and (2) bi-regional colonizations of the 'Southern Aegean Island Arc' from the Western vs. Eastern Aegean mainland, followed by allopatric divergences in Crete vs. Rhodos and Karpathos/Kasos. Outcrossing island taxa experienced drift-related demographic processes that are magnified in the two insular selfing species. Population genetic differentiation on the mainland seems largely driven by dispersal limitation, while in the Central Aegean it may still be influenced by historical events (island fragmentation and sporadic long-distance colonization). The biogeographical history of Aegean Nigella is more complex than expected for a strictly allopatric vicariant model of divergence. Nonetheless, the major phylogeographical boundaries of this radiation are largely congruent with the geography and history of islands, with little evidence for ongoing gene exchange between divergent taxa. The present results emphasize the need to investigate further biological and landscape features and contemporary vs. historical processes in driving population divergence and taxon diversification in Aegean plant radiations."

"Hybridization is an important source of variation; it transfers adaptive genetic variation across species boundaries and generates new species. Yet, the limits to viable hybrid genome formation are poorly understood. Here we investigated to what extent hybrid genomes are free to evolve by sequencing the genomes of four island populations of the homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow Passer italiae. We report that a variety of novel and fully functional hybrid genomic combinations are likely to have arisen independently on Crete, Corsica, Sicily and Malta, with differentiation in candidate genes for beak shape and plumage colour. However, certain genomic regions are invariably inherited from the same parent species, limiting variation. These regions are over-represented on the Z chromosome and harbour candidate incompatibility loci, including DNA-repair and mitonuclear genes. These gene classes may contribute to the general reduction of introgression on sex chromosomes. This study demonstrates that hybrid genomes may vary, and identifies new candidate reproductive isolation genes. "

Vibrio alginolyticus is a common marine bacterium implicated in disease outbreaks in marine farmed fish and invertebrates. Due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics in aquaculture, alternative therapies have been proposed. One of the most promising options is the use of lytic bacteriophages to control pathogenic bacteria. This work describes the isolation and characterization of a lytic phage (VEN) against a V. alginolyticus strain (V2) isolated from a disease outbreak in common dentex (Dentex dentex) cultured at the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR) in Crete, Greece. The bacteriophage is morphologically similar to phages from Podoviridae family and remained stable for 1 year at 4 °C and over 1 h when kept at 50 °C. VEN was able to lyse the host bacteria at several multiplicity of infection (MOI) (0.1-100) in liquid cultures. However, it was unable to infect other V. alginolyticus strains. Its genome consists of 44,603 bp with a GC content of 43.5%, while sequence analysis revealed the presence of 54 potential ORFs with a T7-like genomic organization. Almost 65% of the predicted ORFs presented homology with proteins of the vibriophages Vc1 and phi-A318 infecting Vibrio cyclitrophicus and Vibrio alginolyticus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis applying the amino acid sequence of the large terminase subunit confirmed the close relationship of these phages. Furthermore, the comparison of the RNA polymerase of these phages revealed that the motifs A, B and C related to the catalytic activity and the recognition loop related to promotor identification were also conserved. VEN has an obligate lytic life cycle demonstrated by experimental data and genomic analysis. These results suggest that VEN may provide a good candidate to control recurrent diseases caused by V. alginolyticus at HCMR.

"Vitamin D may modulate adipogenesis. However, limited studies have investigated the effect of maternal vitamin D during pregnancy on offspring adiposity or cardiometabolic parameters with inconclusive results. The objective of this study is to examine the association of maternal 25(OH)-vitamin D [25(OH)D] status with offspring obesity and cardiometabolic characteristics in 532 mother-child pairs from the prospective pregnancy cohort Rhea in Crete, Greece. Maternal 25(OH)D concentrations were measured at the first prenatal visit (mean: 14 weeks, SD: 4). Child outcomes included body mass index standard deviation score, waist circumference, skin-fold thickness, blood pressure and serum lipids at ages 4 and 6 years. Body fat percentage was also measured at 6 years. Body mass index growth trajectories from birth to 6 years were estimated by mixed effects models with fractional polynomials of age. Adjusted associations were obtained via multivariable linear regression analyses. About two-thirds of participating mothers had 25(OH)D concentrations &lt;50 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> . Offspring of women in the low 25(OH)D tertile (&lt;37.7 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> ) had higher body mass index standard deviation score (β 0.20, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.37), and waist circumference (β 0.87 95% CI: 0.12, 1.63) at preschool age, compared with the offspring of women with higher 25(OH)D measurements (≥37.7 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> ), on covariate-adjusted analyses. The observed relationships persisted at age 6 years. We found no association between maternal 25(OH)D concentrations and offspring blood pressure or serum lipids at both time points. Exposure to very low 25(OH)D concentrations in utero may increase childhood adiposity indices. Given that vitamin D is a modifiable risk factor, our findings may have important public health implications."

On this basis, the <i>n</i>-butanol extract was analysed by liquid chromatography-diode array-mass spectrometry, to tentatively characterise the principal polyphenolic components, which were shown to be flavonol but mainly flavone derivatives. <b>Conclusions</b>: The most potent radical-scavenging compounds were detected in the <i>n</i>-butanol fraction of the extracts, suggesting that the most active antioxidants in <i>S. mucronate</i> are relatively polar. The analyses suggested the major constituents to be derivatives of the flavone luteolin, accompanied by apigenin analogues, as well as flavonol glycosides and chlorogenate conjugates.

In the recent Greek ages the most devastating epidemics were plague, smallpox, leprosy and cholera. In 1816 plague struck the Ionian and Aegean Islands, mainland Greece, Constantinople and Smyrna. The Venetians ruling the Ionian Islands effectively combated plague in contrast to the Ottomans ruling all other regions. In 1922, plague appeared in Patras refugees who were expelled by the Turks from Smyrna and Asia Minor. Inoculation against smallpox was first performed in Thessaly by the Greek women, and the Greek doctors Emmanouel Timonis (1713, Oxford) and Jakovos Pylarinos (1715, Venice) made relevant scientific publications. The first leper colony opened in Chios Island. In Crete, Spinalonga was transformed into a leper island, which following the Independence War against Turkish occupation and the unification of Crete with Greece in 1913, was classified as an International Leper Hospital. Cholera struck Greece in 1853-1854 brought by the French troops during the Crimean War, and again during the Balkan Wars (1912-13) when the Bulgarian troops brought cholera to northern Greece. Due to successive wars, medical assistance was not always available, so desperate people turned many times to religion through processions in honor of local saints, for their salvation in epidemics.

Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in vivo is associated with many chronic disorders such as diabetes, renal failure, aging, and Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to expand the knowledge about the functional properties of Origanum dictamnus L. beverage (Cretan tea) by an investigation about the inhibitory effects on the formation of AGEs and the capacity to trap dicarbonyl compounds. Dittany infusion was characterized for its polyphenolic composition by RP-HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS<sup>n</sup> and twenty compounds were detected. Its antiglycative property was evaluated by in vitro BSA-sugar (glucose, fructose, and ribose) and BSA-methylglyoxal (MGO) assays, tests for the formation of Amadori products and dicarbonyl compounds, and the direct glyoxal (GO) and MGO trapping capacity. The infusion showed the highest inhibitory effect on the formation of dicarbonyl compounds and AGEs (activity values range from 72-100%) and only a weak effect on the formation of Amadori products, indicating that the antiglycative action occurred primarily during the last two phases of the non-enzymatic glycation reaction. These activities are partially correlated with the antioxidant/antiradical activity, as demonstrated by the scavenger capacity against the ABTS cation and DPPH stable radicals, and the reducing power. The registered high anti-AGE capacity could probably be ascribed to the dittany polyphenolic composition particularly rich in flavone derivatives. These findings support further investigations to study the feasibility of dittany as an antiglycative agent in food or cosmetic preparation.

Phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) are vectors of Leishmania spp., protozoan parasites responsible for a group of neglected diseases called leishmaniases. Two sand fly genera, Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia, contain species that are present in the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus where the visceral (VL), cutaneous (CL) and canine (CanLei) leishmaniases are a public health concern. The risk of transmission of different Leishmania species can be studied in an area by monitoring their vectors. Sand fly species are traditionally identified using morphological characteristics but minute differences between individuals or populations could be overlooked leading to wrong epidemiological predictions. Molecular identification of these important vectors has become, therefore, an essential tool for research tasks concerning their geographical distribution which directly relates to leishmaniasis control efforts. DNA barcoding is a widely used molecular identification method for cataloguing animal species by sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial gene encoding cytochrome oxidase I. DNA barcoding was used to identify individuals of five sand fly species (Phlebotomus papatasi, P. similis, P. killicki, Sergentomyia minuta, S. dentata) circulating in the islands of Crete and Cyprus during the years 2011-2014. Phlebotomus papatasi is a known vector of zoonotic CL in the Middle East and it is found in both islands. Phlebotomus similis is the suspected vector of Leishmania tropica in Greece causing anthroponotic CL. Phlebotomus killicki was collected in Cyprus for the first time. Sergentomyia minuta, found to present intraspecific diversity, is discussed for its potential as a Leishmania vector. Molecular identification was consistent with the morphological identification. It successfully identified males and females, which is difficult when using only morphological characters. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the barcodes acquired, representing their genetic relationships along with other species from the area studied. All individuals identified were clustered according to their species and subgenus. Molecular identification of sand flies via DNA barcoding can accurately identify these medically important insects assisting traditional morphological tools, thus helping to assess their implication in Leishmania transmission.

"The paper attempts to document the ontology of socio-hydrological systems (SHSs), propose approaches of delimitation of SHSs' (territorial) boundaries, and investigate operational aspects of their adaptation to drought including repercussions on sustainability. To this end, a series of hypotheses are tested: (a) SHSs contain social subsystems with different expectations regarding water resources, different adaptive capacities, adaptation limits and prospects of sustainability, (b) SHSs do not adapt homogenously; some of their subsystems manage optimum adaptation, others fail to adapt and (c) territorial transformation of SHSs (e.g., through expansion of SHSs) may be the result of differential adaptation and sustainability potential within the SHS owing to power relations. After testing above hypotheses in the SHS of Messara Plain, Crete, the authors found out that powerful and dynamic sub-SHSs expand or break the boundaries of the initial SHS by establishing new relationships with other SHSs for the sake of resilience resources. Conversely, powerless sub-SHSs incapable to adapt descend and disappear. Therefore, territorial transformation of SHSs comes about from a combination of successful and failed adaptations, or in other words from different adaptation limits within SHSs. Consequently, water management and local development planning to guarantee adaptability to drought for all should be based on SHSs' analysis and management, not on jurisdictional areas or hydrological basins.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the nanoparticle emissions from a laser printer in a chamber in conjunction with emissions from printers in a print room (PR) and to characterize the processes that lead to increased nanoparticle concentrations, as well as to estimate the human particle dose of the printers' users. Measurements were conducted in a small stainless steel environmental chamber under controlled conditions, where the evolution of particle size distributions (PSDs) with time and printed pages was studied in detail. Printer was generating nanoparticles (vast majority ˂ 50 nm with mode on ~ 15 nm) primarily during cold startup. Previously, 1-week sampling was also done in a PR at the Technical University of Crete, where the tested laser printer is installed along with three other printers. Similarly, as it was observed in the chamber study, printers' startup on any given day was characterized by a sharp increase in particle number (PN) concentrations. Average measured PN concentrations during printing hours in PR (5.4 × 10<sup>3</sup> #/cm<sup>3</sup>) is similar to the one observed in chamber measurements (6.7 × 10<sup>3</sup> #/cm<sup>3</sup>). The ExDoM2 dosimetry model was further applied to calculate the deposition of particles in the human respiratory tract. More precisely, the increase in particle dose for an adult Caucasian male was 14.6- and 24.1-fold at printers' startup, and 1.2- and 5.2-fold during printing in the PR and experimental chamber, respectively, compared to the exposure dose at background concentrations (BCs).

"The mean gamma-ray distribution in Crete during the years after the nuclear accident at Chernobyl and its correlation with the Papillary Thyroid Cancer (PTC) distribution was identified. A total of 4285 patients underwent total thyroidectomy in our centre between 1990 and 2012. Data of gamma-ray (nSv/h) distribution were selected from the Greek Statistical Authorisation. A geo-spatial statistical model was used to estimate the expected number of patients with PTC and Kriging interpolation prediction model to estimate their distribution. Geographical weighted regression was performed to estimate the risk of PTC in relation to gamma ray distribution. All factors that were examined were found to be statistically significant for PTC distribution in Crete. Gamma-ray was determined as a significant risk factor (OR = 2.89; 95% CI = 1.682-4.989; p value = 0.03). There is a significant correlation between gamma-ray exposure and the increased prevalence of the PTC suggesting that the former may have been a significant risk factor."
PMID:29539471	Bourbou C	Int J Paleopathol. 5:86-94	2014	Evidence of childhood scurvy in a Middle Byzantine Greek population from Crete, Greece (11th-12th centuries A.D.).	Archaeological evidence of scurvy in Greece has previously included only a few cases. Recently, during the study of a Middle Byzantine (11th-12th centuries A.D.) Greek population from Crete, Greece, four non-adult skeletons were found to exhibit abnormal porosity and reactive new bone formation, mainly on the cranial and post-cranial bones, which vary in extent and severity. These lesions are similar to those reported in previous studies of juvenile scurvy, suggesting that most likely the individuals suffered from this condition at the time of death. Further, a biocultural approach is applied here in order to contextualize these findings, as well as to explore the reasons for the sporadic appearance of the disease. It is proposed that these cases are indicative of undernutrition and that the development of scurvy in this Middle Byzantine Greek population might be associated with weaning and the type/quality of solid foods introduced after cessation of breastfeeding. The reported cases are important because archaeological evidence of scurvy in this geographical area is relatively rare, and they contribute to the broader global understandings of the cultural variables that mediate the expression of skeletal manifestations of juvenile scurvy.

Candiacervus sp.II is one of the deer species that inhabited the island of Crete during the Late Pleistocene. The species evolved on the island under a prolonged period of isolation and, as a consequence, developed a high degree of endemism. Fossils of this species have been discovered at many Cretan sites, including Liko cave (an attritional accumulation of several thousand fossils). In this paper, we present the results of a systematic analysis of the prevalence and anatomical distribution of bone lesions of Candiacervus sp.II, from that cave. We identified one metapodial with a healed fracture and nine (various) specimens with moderate to severe degenerative lesions of osteoarthritis. The lesions were evaluated macroscopically and radiographically, and they were classified as traumatic or degenerative. Degenerative lesions that affected adult individuals had prevalence rates below 5% and were attributed to environmental or nutritional causes. Representative bones were sampled for histological evaluation, to provide essential baseline data on possible underlying disorders. The aims of this study are to provide evidence for bone disease contributing to species morbidity, and to shed new light on causes and potential palaeoecological significance.

Kotschy's Gecko, Mediodactylus kotschyi, is a small gecko native to southeastern Europe and the Levant. It displays great morphological variation with a large number of morphologically recognized subspecies. However, it has been suggested that it constitutes a species complex of several yet unrecognized species. In this study, we used multilocus sequence data (three mitochondrial and three nuclear gene fragments) to estimate the phylogenetic relationships of 174 specimens from 129 sampling localities, covering a substantial part of the distribution range of the species. Our results revealed high genetic diversity of M. kotschyi populations and contributed to our knowledge about the phylogenetic relationships and the estimation of the divergence times between them. Diversification within M. kotschyi began approximately 15 million years ago (Mya) in the Middle Miocene, whereas the diversification within most of the major clades have been occurred in the last 5 Mya. Species delimitation analysis suggests there exists five species within the complex, and we propose to tentatively recognize the following taxa as full species: M. kotschyi (mainland Balkans, most of Aegean islands, and Italy), M. orientalis (Levant, Cyprus, southern Anatolia, and south-eastern Aegean islands), M. danilewskii (Black Sea region and south-western Anatolia), M. bartoni (Crete), and M. oertzeni (southern Dodecanese Islands). This newly recognized diversity underlines the complex biogeographical history of the Eastern Mediterranean region.

The Mediterranean islands are known as natural laboratories of evolution with a high level of endemic biodiversity. However, most biodiversity assessments have focused mainly on terrestrial and marine fauna, leaving the freshwater animals aside. Crete is one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean Basin, with a long history of isolation from the continental mainland. Gammarid amphipods are often dominant in macrozoobenthic communities in European inland waters. They are widely used in biomonitoring and exotoxicological studies. Herein, we describe <i>Gammarus plaitisi</i> sp. nov., endemic to Cretan streams, based on morphological characters and a set of molecular species delimitation methods using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I and 16S rRNA genes as well as nuclear 28S rDNA, ITS1 and EF1-alpha genes. The divergence of the new species is strongly connected with the geological history of the island supporting its continental origin.

Water scarcity and droughts are a major concern in most Mediterranean countries. Agriculture is a major user of water in the region and releases significant amounts of surface and ground waters, endangering the sustainable use of the available resources. Best Management Practices (BMPs) can mitigate the agriculture impacts on quantity of surface waters in agricultural catchments. However, identification of efficient BMPs strategies is a complex task, because BMPs costs and effectiveness can vary significantly within a basin. In this study, sustainable agricultural practices were studied based on optimal allocation of irrigation water use for dominant irrigated crops in the island of Crete, Greece. A decision support tool that integrates the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model, an economic model, and multi-objective optimization routines, was used to identify and locate optimal irrigation strategies by considering crop water requirements, impact of irrigation changes on crop productivity, management strategies costs, and crop market prices. Three spatial scales (crop type, fields, and administrative regions) were considered to point out different approaches of efficient management. According to the analysis, depending on the spatial scale and complexity of spatial optimization, water irrigation volumes could be reduced by 32%-70% while preserving current agricultural benefit. Specific management strategies also looked at ways to relocate water between administrative regions (4 prefectures in the case of Crete) to optimize crop benefit while reducing global water use. It was estimated that an optimal reallocation of water could reduce irrigation water volumes by 52% (148 Mm<sup>3</sup>/y) at the cost of a 7% (48 M€) loss of agricultural income, but maintaining the current agricultural benefit (626.9 M€). The study showed how the identification of optimal, cost-effective irrigation management strategies can potentially address the water scarcity issue that is becoming crucial for the viability of agriculture in the Mediterranean region.

This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, clinical and microbiological features, treatment, and outcomes of infective endocarditis (IE) on the island of Crete, a region with high levels of antimicrobial resistance. Medical records of all hospitalized patients diagnosed with IE at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, from 1995 to 2015, were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who met the modified Duke's criteria for definite or possible IE were included. A total of 82 IE patients (median age 67 [range 21-86] years) were included. Most patients suffered from left-sided IE (94%), while most cases of infection occurred in native valves (53.6%). Systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were lacking in almost half of the patient population. The leading causative microorganism was Staphylococcus aureus, isolated in 24 cases (29%), followed by Streptococcus spp. in 15 (18%) and Enterococcus spp. in 12 (14.5%). A number of rare and difficult to treat microorganisms had been identified, such as Gemella morbillorum in four cases (4.5%), Streptococcus lugdunensis in two (2.5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one (1%). One patient was serologically positive for Coxiella burnetii (1%). All patients received empirical antimicrobial treatment, proven appropriate in 39 blood culture-positive patients (56.5%). Thirteen (16%) patients were classified as culture negative. Seven patients (8.5%) were surgically treated. In-hospital death occurred in 9 patients (11%). Changes in IE profile requires continuous epidemiological updates. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus spp. remain the most common etiologic agents. However, the presence of uncommon and/or difficult to treat pathogens raise concerns on the appropriate prophylaxis as well as empirical treatment.

Early detection of cardiovascular (CV) disease or associated risk factors during childhood is of paramount importance, allowing for early treatment or lifestyle modifications, respectively. The objective of this study was to describe the development of an electronic health record (EHR), with integrated computerized decision support system (CDSS), specifically designed for supporting the needs of a pilot pediatric CV disease screening program applied on primary school students of a Mediterranean island. Evidence-based knowledge, national and international practice guidelines regarding sport preparticipation CV screening of children and young athletes has been used for the design of the designated EHR. A CDSS, capable for providing alerts for further cardiology evaluation need, has been incorporated into the EHR, based on normative anthropometric and electrocardiographic data as well as predefined positive history responses. We developed a designated EHR with integrated CDSS supporting pediatric CV disease screening, capable for documenting CV-related personal and family history responses, physical evaluation data (weight, height, blood pressure), allowing for entering electrocardiogam (ECG) measurements and for uploading of multimedia files (including ECG images and digital phonocardiogram audio files). The EHR incorporates clinical calculators and referral alerts for the presence (and degree) of adiposity, hypertension, ECG abnormalities and positive history responses indicative of high CV disease risk. In a preliminary EHR validation, performed by entering data from 53 previously available paper-based health records, the EHR was proven to be fully functional. The pediatric cardiology EHR with CDSS features which we developed might serve as a model for EHR for primary health care purposes, capable to document and early detect CV disease and associated risk factors in pediatric populations.

Debated aspects in speciation research concern the amount of gene flow between incipient species under secondary contact and the modes by which post-zygotic isolation accumulates. Secondary contact zones of allopatric lineages, involving varying levels of divergence, provide natural settings for comparative studies, for which the Aegean (Eastern Mediterranean) geography offers unique scenarios. In Palearctic green toads (Bufo viridis subgroup or Bufotes), Plio-Pleistocene (~ 2.6 Mya) diverged species show a sharp transition without contemporary gene flow, while younger lineages, diverged in the Lower-Pleistocene (~ 1.9 Mya), admix over tens of kilometers. Here, we conducted a fine-scale multilocus phylogeographic analysis of continental and insular green toads from the Aegean, where a third pair of taxa, involving Mid-Pleistocene diverged (~ 1.5 Mya) mitochondrial lineages, earlier tentatively named viridis and variabilis, (co-)occurs. We discovered a new lineage, endemic to Naxos (Central Cyclades), while coastal islands and Crete feature weak genetic differentiation from the continent. In continental Greece, both lineages, viridis and variabilis, form a hybrid swarm, involving massive mitochondrial and nuclear admixture over hundreds of kilometers, without obvious selection against hybrids. The genetic signatures of insular Aegean toads appear governed by bathymetry and Quaternary sea level changes, resulting in long-term isolation (Central Cyclades: Naxos) and recent land-bridges (coastal islands). Conversely, Crete has been isolated since the end of the Messinian salinity crisis (5.3 My) and Cretan populations thus likely result from human-mediated colonization, at least since Antiquity, from Peloponnese and Anatolia. Comparisons of green toad hybrid zones support the idea that post-zygotic hybrid incompatibilities accumulate gradually over the genome. In this radiation, only one million years of divergence separate a scenario of complete reproductive isolation, from a secondary contact resulting in near panmixia.

"Hypothyroidism is a significant cause of pericardial effusion. However, large pericardial effusions due to hypothyroidism are extremely rare. Hormone replacement therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism and regular follow-up of patients after initiation of the therapy is indicated. Herein, the case of a 70-year-old woman with a massive pericardial effusion due to Hashimoto's disease is presented. A 70-year-old female from a rural village on the island of Crete, Greece, was admitted to our hospital due to a urinary tract infection. She was under hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine 100 &amp;micro;g once a day for Hashimoto's disease. Two years previously, the patient had had an episode of pericarditis due to hypothyroidism and had undergone a computed tomography-guided pericardiocentesis. The patient did not have regular follow-up and did not take the hormone replacement therapy properly. On admission, the patient's chest X-ray incidentally showed a possible pericardial effusion. The patient was referred for echocardiography, which revealed a massive pericardial effusion. Beck's triad was absent. Thyroid hormones were consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 30.25 mIU/mL (normal limits: 0.25-3.43); free thyroxin 4 0.81 ng/dL (normal limits: 0.7-1.94). The patient had a score of 5 on the scale outlined by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) position statement on triage strategy for cardiac tamponade and, despite the absence of cardiac tamponade, a pericardiocentesis was performed after 48 hours. The patient was treated with 125 &amp;micro;g levothyroxine orally once daily. This was a rare case of an elderly female patient from a rural village with chronic massive pericardial effusion due to subclinical hypothyroidism without cardiac tamponade. Hypothyroidism should be included in the differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion, especially in a case of unexplained pericardial fluid. Initiation of hormone replacement therapy should be personalised in elderly patients. TSH levels &gt;10 mU/L usually require therapy with levothyroxine in order to prevent adverse events. Rural patients usually do not have regular follow-up after the initiation of hormone replacement therapy. Pericardial effusions due to hypothyroidism grow slowly and subclinical hypothyroidism rarely shows signs and symptoms and can be underdiagnosed. The ESC position statement on triage strategy for pericardial diseases is a valuable clinical tool to estimate the necessity for pericardial drainage in such cases."

To investigate the epidemiology of childhood Type 1 diabetes mellitus in Crete over the last 25 years and to evaluate incidence trends over time. The study included all children aged 0-14 years who live in Crete and were diagnosed during the 25-year period from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2016. A total of 271 children were diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes during the 25-year period: 148 boys and 123 girls (boy:girl ratio 1.2). The median (interquartile range) age at diagnosis was 8.3 (5.0-12.0) years for boys and 8.0 (5.3-11.3) years for girls. The standardized annual incidence rate was 10.5 per 100 000 children (95% CI 9.2 to 11.8). Incidence rates were higher in children aged 5-9 years. During the 25-year study period an average 4.4% annual increase in incidence was documented and was most prominent in the age group 5-14 years. Incidence seemed to remain relatively stable for the age group 0-4 years in the last decade. No seasonality of the clinical onset of Type 1 diabetes was observed. The recent increase in Type 1 diabetes incidence places Crete among regions with high incidence as per the World Health Organization DiaMond project classification. The rising trends in incidence confirmed by this study are in accordance with the reported global trends in Type 1 diabetes incidence.

"The persistence of glyphosate and its primary metabolite AMPA (aminomethylphosphonic acid) was monitored in two areas in Southern Greece (Peza, Crete and Chora Trifilias, Peloponnese) with a known history of glyphosate use, and the levels of residues were linked to spray operators' activities in the respective areas. A total of 170 samples were collected and analysed from both areas during a 3-year monitoring study. A new method (Impact Assessment Procedure - IAP) designed to assess potential impacts to the environment caused by growers' activities, was utilised in the explanation of the results. The level of residues was compared to the predicted environmental concentrations in soil. The ratio of the measured concentrations to the predicted environmental concentrations (MCs/PECs) was &gt; 1 in Chora the first 2 years of sampling and &lt; 1 in the third year, whilst the MCs/PECs ratio was &lt; 1 in Peza, throughout the whole monitoring period. The compliance to the instructions for best handling practices, which operators received during the monitoring period, was reflected in the amount of residues and the MCs/PECs ratio in the second and especially the third sampling year. Differences in the level of residues between areas as well as sampling sites of the same area were identified. AMPA persisted longer than the parent compound glyphosate in both areas."

This paper presents an R script that quantifies the shape of selected cranial traits and automates sex estimation. The proposed functions were tested on two modern Greek assemblages. The discriminant variables input in the functions are calculated from a digital photograph of the lateral view of the cranium. The cranial outline is determined using the Canny edge detector and discriminant variables that quantify the shape of the glabella/frontal bone, mastoid process, and external occipital protuberance are computed. The best cross-validated results for pooled sexes in the Athens Collection range from 84.2% to 87.3%, and increase up to 93.9% when half of the sample is used for training and the rest for prediction, while correct classification for the Cretan material is 80-90% for optimum combinations of discriminant variables. The greatest advantage of the proposed method is its straightforward and time-efficient application.

"Rates of tobacco treatment delivery in primary care are suboptimal. We report on the effectiveness of the TiTAN Crete intervention on rates of patient-reported 4As (ask, advise, assist, arrange) tobacco treatment and general practitioner's (GP) knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions. A quasi-experimental pilot study with pre-post evaluation was conducted in Crete, Greece (2015-2016). GPs ( n = 24) intervention and control group and a cross-sectional sample of their patients ( n = 841) were surveyed before the implementation of the intervention. GPs in the intervention group received training, practice, and patient tools to support the integration of the 4As treatment into clinical routines. Intervention group GPs ( n = 14) and a second cross-sectional sample of patients ( n = 460) were surveyed 4 months following the intervention to assess changes in outcomes of interest. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze data. Among GPs exposed to the intervention, significant increases in knowledge, self-efficacy, and rates of 4As delivery were documented between the pre- and postassessment and compared with those of the control group. Specifically, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 4As delivery between the pre-and postassessment among GPs exposed to the TiTAN intervention were as follows: Ask AOR 3.66 (95% CI [2.61, 5.14]); Advise AOR 4.21 (95% CI [3.02, 5.87]); Assist AOR 13.10 (95% CI [8.83, 19.42]) and Arrange AOR 4.75 (95% CI [2.67, 8.45]). We found significant increases in rates at which GPs delivered evidence-based tobacco treatment following exposure to the TiTAN intervention. Future research should examine methods for supporting broader dissemination of well-designed training interventions in general practice."

Results of measurements of radon around of the Black Sea are shown. Radon stations in zones of active faults were placed. Simultaneous hourly measurements of soil radon in 2005 were carried out in the Sivrice Fault Zone that is a segment of East Anatolian Fault System, in the town of Tbilisi (Georgia) and in the South Russia. In 2008 simultaneously hourly measurements of soil radon were carried out in the Western Caucasus (Russia) and in the Mytilene Island (Greece). In 2013 radon in underground waters simultaneously in midday was measuring in Crete (Greece), in the Pamukkale geothermal region (Southwest Turkey) and in the Western Caucasus. Measurements of radon concentration in the points located around of the Black Sea have shown identical regularities in changes of the data. Influence of meteorological, tidal and solar factors on changes of water radon concentrations and soil radon concentrations was observed in all researches points. But this influence was insignificant. Seismological application of observed results also was considered. Various mathematical methods of definition of anomaly in the radon data during earthquakes were considered. During researches in the Black Sea region basically earthquakes with M from 2.0 up to 5.0 and in a depth about 10 km were occurred. For these earthquakes method of daily subtraction of the data of the next and previous day was used. This method has allowed solving a problem with a choice of average value. Probability up to 0.69 (number of earthquakes with radon anomalies/total number of earthquakes) of detection of radon anomalies before earthquakes was achieved applying this method. Changes of radon maps before regional earthquakes were also observed. The frequency analysis of variations of the radon data on the basis of the Wavelet analysis was carried out. Occurrence of the short periods (about 2 days) was observed during regional earthquakes.

Α reduction of pyrethroid efficacy has been recently recorded in Bactrocera oleae, the most destructive insect of olives. The resistance levels of field populations collected from Crete-Greece scaled up to 22-folds, compared to reference laboratory strains. Sequence analysis of the IIS4-IIS6 region of para sodium channel gene in a large number of resistant flies indicated that resistance may not be associated with target site mutations, in line with previous studies in other Tephritidae species. We analyzed the transcriptomic differences between two resistant populations versus an almost susceptible field population and two laboratory strains. A large number of genes was found to be significantly differentially transcribed across the pairwise comparisons. Interestingly, gene set analysis revealed that genes of the 'electron carrier activity' GO group were enriched in one specific comparison, which might suggest a P450-mediated resistance mechanism. The up-regulation of several transcripts encoding detoxification enzymes was qPCR validated, focusing on transcripts coding for P450s. Of note, the expression of contig00436 and contig02103, encoding CYP6 P450s, was significantly higher in all resistant populations, compared to susceptible ones. These results suggest that an increase in the amount of the CYP6 P450s might be an important mechanism of pyrethroid resistance in B. oleae.

Hybridization is increasingly recognized as a potent evolutionary force. Although additive genetic variation and novel combinations of parental genes theoretically increase the potential for hybrid species to adapt, few empirical studies have investigated the adaptive potential within a hybrid species. Here, we address whether genomic contingencies, adaptation to climate, or diet best explain divergence in beak morphology using genomically diverged island populations of the homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow Passer italiae from Crete, Corsica, and Sicily. Populations vary significantly in beak morphology both between and within islands of origin. Temperature seasonality best explains population divergence in beak size. Interestingly, beak shape along all significant dimensions of variation was best explained by annual precipitation, genomic composition, and their interaction, suggesting a role for contingencies. Moreover, beak shape similarity to a parent species correlates with proportion of the genome inherited from that species, consistent with the presence of contingencies. In conclusion, adaptation to local conditions and genomic contingencies arising from putatively independent hybridization events jointly explain beak morphology in the Italian sparrow. Hence, hybridization may induce contingencies and restrict evolution in certain directions dependent on the genetic background.

Stakeholder engagement in the processes of planning local adaptation to climate change faces many challenges. The goal of this work was to explore whether or not the intention of engaging could be understood (Study 1) and promoted (Study 2), by using an extension of the theory of planned behaviour. In Study 1, stakeholders from three European Mediterranean case studies were surveyed: Baixo Vouga Lagunar (Portugal), SCOT Provence Méditerranée (France), and the island of Crete (Greece) (N = 115). Stakeholders' intention of engaging was significantly predicted by subjective norm (which was predicted by injunctive normative beliefs towards policy-makers and stakeholders) and by perceived behavioural control (which was predicted by knowledge of policy and instruments). Study 2 was conducted in the Baixo Vouga Lagunar case study and consisted of a two-workshop intervention where issues on local and regional adaptation, policies, and engagement were presented and discussed. A within-participants comparison of initial survey results with results following the workshops (N<sub>T1</sub> = 12, N<sub>T2</sub> = 15, N<sub>T3</sub> = 12) indicated that these were successful in increasing stakeholders' intention of engaging. This increase was paired with a) an increase in injunctive normative beliefs towards policy-makers and consequently in subjective norm, and to b) a decrease in perceived complexity of planning local adaptation and an increase in knowledge regarding adaptation to climate change.

"Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine, is elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and is considered an independent predictor of T2D. IL-6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with higher levels of IL-6. This study investigated the role of an IL-6 gene polymorphism and its possible association to T2D in the genetically homogeneous Greek population of the island of Crete. A total of 144 patients with T2D and 180 controls, all Cretans, selected from the Diabetes Clinic and the Department of Internal Medicine at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, were genotyped for the IL-6 -174G&gt;C (rs1800795) SNP by the restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The G/C genotype and the minor allele C of the IL-6 rs1800795 SNP were more common in individuals with T2D than controls (p = 0.004, odds ratio [OR] = 1.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-3.18 and p = 0.011, OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.11-2.26, respectively). An association of the rs1800795 SNP of the IL-6 gene with T2D has been detected for the first time in Cretans. The present results, in combination with those presented previously from different ethnic/racial populations, highlight the necessity of comparative studies among different ethnic/racial populations to detect genetic characteristics and associations with T2D."

"This paper presents a new integrated GIS modeling method to assess drought vulnerability using multi-criteria analysis. The proposed methodology is an improvement over previous methods since it incorporates both dynamic and static factors that may affect water dynamics and contribute to water scarcity. These factors are: a) precipitation, b) evapotranspiration, c) soil water content, d) soil depth, e) artificial drainage, f) depth to water table, g) runoff accumulation, and h) saltwater intrusion zones. The above factors and their corresponding maps were fuzzified and spatially overlayed in order to obtain the final drought vulnerability map. The map depicts the spatial distribution of drought vulnerability represented by five classes ranging from very low to very high vulnerability. The proposed methodology was applied to the Greek island of Crete located in the Southeast Mediterranean region. The island of Crete is one of the most drought-prone areas in the region, while at the same time the island's economy relies strongly on agriculture and tourism. The derived results show that drought vulnerability is more severe in the eastern part of the island and that the coastal zones of the entire island are drought-prone areas. Also, according to the results, 19% of the island's area is characterized as ""very highly vulnerable to drought"". This percentage varies significantly across the prefectures, with Rethymnon having the lowest vulnerability (2.8%), followed by the prefectures of Chania (6.3%), and Heraklion (17.3%), while the prefecture of Lassithi is the most vulnerable to drought (51.4%). The developed methodology was validated using historical data for drought affected areas in Crete, which is not always addressed in publications. Moreover, in this study, sustainable agricultural practices that ensure water efficiency especially in drought prone areas are proposed. These practices can be adopted by farmers to promote climate resilient agriculture in the Mediterranean region."

The performance of two vineyard strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae SacPK7 and Starmerella bacillaris StbPK9, was evaluated in laboratory and pilot scale fermentations of Cretan grape must under the following inoculation schemes: single inoculation of SacPK7 (IS), simultaneous inoculation of StbPK9 and SacPK7 (SM), and sequential inoculation of StbPK9 followed by SacPK7 (SQ). Un-inoculated (spontaneous) fermentations (SP) and fermentations inoculated with control S. cerevisiae strains (CS) were also conducted as reference. Star. bacillaris not only did not restrict but also slightly promoted the growth of S. cerevisiae when the two strains were co-inoculated at equal quantities. On the contrary, the SQ inoculation scheme conferred a competitive advantage to Star. bacillaris over S. cerevisiae, which maximum population was reduced, while increased levels of Star. bacillaris were recorded. The fermentation kinetics were also affected, accordingly. The completion of fermentation was faster in SM, IS and CS ferments than in SQ and SP. Ethanol accumulation had a predominant role in the early death of Star. bacillaris, since its growth was similarly arrested irrespective of the dominating yeast species, the magnitude of yeast population or the availability of energy sources. Interestingly, the inoculation scheme applied significantly affected the chemical profiles of the resulting wines. SQ produced the most divergent chemical profile in sterile must, with glycerol, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, residual glucose, malic acid, ethyl acetate and higher alcohols being the key compounds affected by the prolonged activity of StbPK9. In pilot scale ferments, the indigenous S. cerevisiae produced twice as high levels of esters and higher alcohols compared to the commercial starter. Star. bacillaris further increased the levels of ethyl esters in the respective ferments. The use of a mixed S. cerevisiae/Star. bacillaris starter culture instead of S. cerevisiae alone enhanced the chemical complexity of Cretan local wine. The magnitude of differentiation was even higher when the addition of Star. bacillaris preceded that of S. cerevisiae. The highest divergence in analytical profiles was recorded between wines produced by native strain combinations and commercial S. cerevisiae. Present results show that the use of indigenous yeast formulations provides significant diversification to local wines, in line with the microbial terroir concept and recent observations that indigenous yeast strains may confer regional characters to wines.

Kinorhynchs rarely show a wide distribution pattern, due to their putatively low dispersal capabilities and/or limited sampling efforts. In this study, a new kinorhynch species is described, <i>Echinoderes pterus</i><b>sp. n.</b>, which shows a geographically and bathymetrically wide distribution, occurring on the Karasik Seamount and off the Svalbard Islands (Arctic Ocean), on the Sedlo Seamount (northeast Atlantic Ocean), and on the deep-sea floor off Crete and on the Anaximenes Seamount (Mediterranean Sea), at a depth range of 675-4,403 m. The new species is characterized by a combination of middorsal acicular spines on segments 4-8, laterodorsal tubes on segment 10, lateroventral tubes on segment 5, lateroventral acicular spines on segments 6-9, tufts of long hairs rising from slits in a laterodorsal position on segment 9, truncated tergal extensions on segment 11, and the absence of any type-2 gland cell outlet. The specimens belonging to the populations from the Arctic Ocean, the Sedlo Seamount, and the Mediterranean Sea show morphological variation in the thickness and length of the spines as well as in the presence/absence of ventromedial sensory spots on segment 7. The different populations are regarded as belonging to a single species because of their overlapping variable characters.
PMID:30022799	Spence JD	Stroke Vasc Neurol. 3(2):69-75	2018	Controlling resistant hypertension. 	"Resistant hypertension (failure to achieve target blood pressures with three or more antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic) is an important and preventable cause of stroke. Hypertension is highly prevalent in China (&gt;60% of persons above age 65), and only ~6% of hypertensives in China are controlled to target levels. Most strokes occur among persons with resistant hypertension; approximately half of strokes could be prevented by blood pressure control. Reasons for uncontrolled hypertension include (1) non-compliance; (2) consumption of substances that aggravated hypertension, such as excess salt, alcohol, licorice, decongestants and oral contraceptives; (3) therapeutic inertia (failure to intensify therapy when target blood pressures are not achieved); and (4) diagnostic inertia (failure to investigate the cause of resistant hypertension). In China, an additional factor is lack of availability of appropriate antihypertensive therapy in many healthcare settings. Sodium restriction in combination with a diet similar to the Cretan Mediterranean or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet can lower blood pressure in proportion to the severity of hypertension. Physiologically individualised therapy for hypertension based on phenotyping by plasma renin activity and aldosterone can markedly improve blood pressure control. Renal hypertension (high renin/high aldosterone) is best treated with angiotensin receptor antagonists; primary aldosteronism (low renin/high aldosterone) is best treated with aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone); and hypertension due to overactivity of the renal epithelial sodium channel (low renin/low aldosterone; Liddle phenotype) is best treated with amiloride. The latter is far more common than most physicians suppose."
PMID:30022800	Spence JD	Stroke Vasc Neurol. 3(2):44-50	2018	Diet for stroke prevention. 	Lifestyle is far more important than most physicians suppose. Dietary changes in China that have resulted from increased prosperity are probably responsible for a marked rise in coronary risk in the past several decades, accelerating in recent years. Intake of meat and eggs has increased, while intake of fruits, vegetables and whole grains has decreased. Between 2003 and 2013, coronary mortality in China increased 213%, while stroke mortality increased by 26.6%. Besides a high content of cholesterol, meat (particularly red meat) contains carnitine, while egg yolks contain phosphatidylcholine. Both are converted by the intestinal microbiome to trimethylamine, in turn oxidised in the liver to trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO). TMAO causes atherosclerosis in animal models, and in patients referred for coronary angiography high levels after a test dose of two hard-boiled eggs predicted increased cardiovascular risk. The strongest evidence for dietary prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction is with the Mediterranean diet from Crete, a nearly vegetarian diet that is high in beneficial oils, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes. Persons at risk of stroke should avoid egg yolk, limit intake of red meat and consume a diet similar to the Mediterranean diet. A crucial issue for stroke prevention in China is reduction of sodium intake. Dietary changes, although difficult to implement, represent an important opportunity to prevent stroke and have the potential to reverse the trend of increased cardiovascular risk in China.

The urban exposome is the set of environmental factors that are experienced in the outdoor urban environment and that may influence child development. The authors' goal was to describe the urban exposome among European pregnant women and understand its socioeconomic determinants. Using geographic information systems, remote sensing and spatio-temporal modeling we estimated exposure during pregnancy to 28 environmental indicators in almost 30,000 women from six population-based birth cohorts, in nine urban areas from across Europe. Exposures included meteorological factors, air pollutants, traffic noise, traffic indicators, natural space, the built environment, public transport, facilities, and walkability. Socioeconomic position (SEP), assessed at both the area and individual level, was related to the exposome through an exposome-wide association study and principal component (PC) analysis. ﻿Mean±standard deviation (SD) NO<sub>2</sub> levels ranged from 13.6±5.1 μg/m<sup>3</sup> (in Heraklion, Crete) to 43.2±11 μg/m<sup>3</sup> (in Sabadell, Spain), mean±SD walkability score ranged from 0.22±0.04 (Kaunas, Lithuania) to 0.32±0.07 (Valencia, Spain) and mean±SD Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ranged from 0.21±0.05 in Heraklion to 0.51±0.1 in Oslo, Norway. Four PCs explained more than half of variation in the urban exposome. There was considerable heterogeneity in social patterning of the urban exposome across cities. For example, high-SEP (based on family education) women lived in greener, less noisy, and less polluted areas in Bradford, UK (0.39 higher PC1 score, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.31, 0.47), but the reverse was observed in Oslo (-0.57 PC1 score, 95% CI: -0.73, -0.41). For most cities, effects were stronger when SEP was assessed at the area level: In Bradford, women living in high SEP areas had a 1.34 higher average PC1 score (95% CI: 1.21, 1.48). The urban exposome showed considerable variability across Europe. Pregnant women of low SEP were exposed to higher levels of environmental hazards in some cities, but not others, which may contribute to inequities in child health and development. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2862.

"The olive moth, <i>Prays oleae</i> (Bernard, 1788) (Lepidoptera: Praydidae) is categorised among the most devastating insect pests of olives, whose anthophagous and carpophagous generations can cause yield loss up to 581 and 846 kg of fruit per ha, respectively. In this study, results of the captured parasitoids in olive tree (<i>Olea europaea</i> Linnaeus, 1753) orchards, or infested olive plant material in Crete, Greece, is presented. Five of the six identified species captured in trap devices are related to <i>P. oleae</i>, i.e., <i>Chelonus elaeaphilus</i> Silvestri, 1908, <i>Chelonus pellucens</i> (Nees, 1816), <i>Apanteles xanthostigma</i> (Haliday, 1834), <i>Diadegma armillatum</i> (Gravenhorst, 1829), and <i>Exochus lentipes</i> Gravenhorst, 1829.

Plastic pollution in the marine environment is one of the foremost environmental problems of our time, as it affects wildlife and human health both directly and indirectly through the effects of contaminants carried by microplastics. This study investigates the temporal and spatial distribution of plastic pellets and fragments in sandy beaches along the coastline of Northern Crete, during 2013. Their densities varied throughout the year in each beach, with highest densities during the summer and towards the upper parts of the beaches. The concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) sorbed on microplastics sampled from nine sandy beaches of Northern Crete was quantified using Gas chromatography - Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry (GC-ITMS). PAHs concentrations ranged from non-detectable levels to 1592 ng/g and fluctuated between sampling periods. Based on the observed patterns of meso- and microplastics distribution, practical guidelines are proposed to minimize the entrance of microplastics into the seawater wherefrom they are exceptionally difficult to collect, if mitigation actions are to be applied.

The outcome of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to study the effect of smoking on liver histology and mortality in a genetically homogeneous population having PBC. Smoking and drinking habits at diagnosis (based on standard criteria) were recorded in 171 Cretan patients with PBC (163 women). A total of 148 patients had a liver biopsy. Odds ratios were calculated with logistic regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves were used for mortality estimation. Smoking was associated with alcohol consumption of more than 20 g/day [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.20, 95% CI: 1.029-4.099], severe steatosis (AOR=5.31, 95% CI: 2.019-9.919), and fibrosis stage F3-F4 (AOR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.015-3.031). Heavy smoking, years of passive smoking, and serious necroinflammatiοn were independent factors associated with advanced fibrosis after adjustment for sex, age, BMI, and alcohol consumption in multivariate analysis. For every pack-year increase in smoking intensity, there was a 3.2 times higher likelihood of advanced fibrosis (95% CI: 2.018-6.294). Increased mortality was found in smokers with advanced PBC. There is an association between smoking, whether active or passive, and advanced fibrosis in PBC. Mortality is increased in smokers with advanced disease at presentation.
PMID:30118876	Nikita E, Xanthopoulou P, Kranioti E	Forensic Sci Int. 291:1-11	2018	An evaluation of Bayesian age estimation using the auricular surface in modern Greek material. 	Pelvic morphology is highly reflective of both sex and age changes in humans, making it a popular research focus in forensic anthropology. Relevant studies range from traditional descriptive to more complicated approaches involving statistical modeling, with the latter having become excessively popular in the last decades. The present study examines the performance of Bayesian statistics in age estimation based on the morphological changes observed on the iliac auricular surface. The aim is two-fold: a) to test whether a Bayesian approach can improve age-at-death estimation compared to the original Lovejoy et al. (1985a) and Buckberry and Chamberlain (2002) methods, and b) to explore the impact of adopting different samples as informative priors as well as for obtaining the transition analysis parameters. For this purpose, two modern Greek documented collections have been used, the Athens and the Cretan Collection. Our results found no clear improvement in age prediction when adopting Bayesian age estimation, with only one exception: Athenian males for the Buckberry and Chamberlain (2002) method. The choice of samples for transition analysis and as informative priors affected the results but this effect was statistically non-significant.

"Elderly patients are underrepresented in the studies concerning anticoagulation therapy (AT) in atrial fibrillation (AF), while patients' frailty status is lacking in most of the studies. Our objective was to evaluate AT in AF elderly patients and study the effect of patients' frailty status on their long-term AT. We conducted an observational prospective study that enrolled consecutive AF patients (≥ 75 years) who were hospitalized in the Department of Internal Medicine of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece from 1 June 2015 to 1 June 2016. We recorded the AT on admission and at discharge, all-cause mortality, and hospital readmission in a follow-up period of 1 year after hospital discharge. Frailty status was assessed by pre-established scores. One hundred and four consecutive patients (49% male; median age 87 years) were enrolled, 78 (78.8%) of whom received AT at discharge. Patients who did not receive AT at discharge had a higher HEMORR<sub>2</sub>HAGES (Hepatic or renal disease, Ethanol abuse, Malignancy, Older age, Reduced platelet count or function, Re-bleeding, Hypertension, Anemia, Genetic factors, Excessive fall risk and Stroke) score (5.5 ± 1.15 vs. 4.79 ± 1.68; p = 0.032), a lower Katz score (2.48 ± 2.23 vs. 4.08 ± 2.25; p = 0.006), and a higher Clinical Frailty Scale score (7 ± 1.95 vs. 5.57 ± 2.05; p = 0.006). Sixty-five patients (62.5%) were readmitted to a hospital during the follow-up period. In-hospital death occurred in five patients (4.8%) and 57 patients (57.6%) died within the follow-up period. A high percentage of the elderly AF patients did not receive AT, even at discharge. Patients who did not receive AT at discharge had higher bleeding and frailty scores. In the 1-year follow-up period after hospital discharge, high all-cause mortality and a high number of hospital readmissions were recorded."

The aim of this study was to contribute to the characterization of Crocus taxa using morphological, phytochemical and genetic analysis. The styles of C. cartwrightianus, C. oreocreticus and C. laevigatus, collected in the island of Crete were compared to those of C. sativus cultivated at the region of Western Macedonia (Greece). Phytochemical analysis was done using GC-MS and HPLC methods, while ISSR markers were used for their genetic characterization. Safranal was the major volatile component of the styles of C. sativus, 4-hydroxy-2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde of C. cartwrightianus and C. oreocreticus, and isophorone of C. laevigatus. C. sativus had the highest content of crocins and picrocrocin, while C. laevigatus the lowest (only 5% of C. sativus' quantity) and negligible amount of picrocrocin. According to both the genetic and the chemical analysis, C. cartwrightianus is more related to C. oreocreticus, while C. sativus and C. laevigatus are more distinct. Concordance between the two different types of data was also confirmed by the Mantel test (r = 0.932, P = .68). This is the first thorough screening of secondary metabolites (volatile and non-volatile) and also genetic and morphological characters of wild Crocus styles simultaneously, that contributes to the identification and valorisation of genotypes with similar to C. sativus traits which may be introduced as new cultivars through breeding.

"The age-at-death estimation thresholds have recently been shifted towards a more objective assessment of the aging process. Such a non-subjective approach offers quantitative methods of age estimation; for instance, the method relating to the surfaces of pubic symphyses of males published by Stoyanova et al. (J Forensic Sci 62:1434-1444, 2017). A validation study was conducted to test the method performance in European samples. The sample consisted of 96 meshes of pubic symphyses of male individuals (known sex and age) that came from four different samples (two Portuguese collections, one Swiss, and one Crete). Stoyanova's method based on five regression models (three univariate and two multivariate models) performed worse in our sample, but only when the whole sample (without age limitation) was included. A sample limited to individuals under 40 years of age achieved better results in our study. The best results were reached through the thin plate spline algorithm (TPS/BE) with a root mean square error of 5.93 years and inaccuracy of 4.47 years. Generally, the multivariate regression models did not contribute to better age estimation. In our sample in all age categories, age was systematically underestimated. The quantitative method tested in this study works best for individuals under 40 years of age and provides a suitable basis for further research."

In the first study phase, a formal diagnosis of dementia had been reached in 4.0% of the participants. However, when selected 505 participants underwent thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation in the second phase of this study (344 with Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] &lt;24 and 161 with MMSE ≥24), and results were extrapolated to the entire cohort, the prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment was estimated at 10.8% (9.7%-11.9%) and 32.4% (30.8%-34.0%), respectively. Using both the field diagnostic data and the extrapolated data, the highest dementia prevalence (27.2%) was found in the 80- to 84-year-old group, who also showed the lowest educational level, apparently due to lack of schooling during World War II."

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is a useful technique to study the structure and dynamics of peptides, proteins and nucleic acids. CD is particularly useful because sample volumes may be as low as 50 μL, it provides high precision and sensitivity, and it achieves a good signal to noise ratio. CD characterizes molecular conformational changes in real time by finely controlling temperature, pH, and titrating urea and guanidine·HCl which is necessary for studying protein folding. Although CD does not provide detailed structure at the atomic level, it provides a global structural framework. Researchers use CD to observe molecular phenomena, namely how macromolecules unfold/refold and their overall self-assembly/disassembly. Using CD to monitor a peptide structure, I serendipitously discovered the self-assembling peptide EAK16 from yeast protein Zuotin. This unusual peptide formed a new type of nanofiber scaffold hydrogel material. The discovery in 1990 opened a new field in the design and study of numerous self-assembling peptides, thereby launching the area of peptide nanobiotechnology. In this review, I reflect on my personal discoveries of several self-assembling peptides, investigations into the dynamic behaviors of peptides, as well as the impact of the work on society. I also describe studies of natural membrane proteins and engineered membrane proteins using CD. Furthermore, I enjoyed numerous and close interactions with Jack Aviv since 1997. He generously supported 10 high impact workshops (Crete and Mikonos) and meetings in various countries around the world that left fond memories of many young researches who later became leading scientists in their respective fields.

PMID:30286347	Kornilaki M, Font X	J Environ Manage. 230:183-189	2019	Normative influences: How socio-cultural and industrial norms influence the adoption of sustainability practices. A grounded theory of Cretan, small tourism firms. 	Previous research explains the various factors that motivate or discourage the owner-managers of small firms to behave sustainably. However, it has failed to develop a meaningful understanding of how these factors inter-relate or combine to influence their decisions. This research identifies and explains how socio-cultural and industrial norms influence the intentions and behaviours towards sustainability of owner-managers of small tourism firms. This grounded theory study shows how selective peer association allows the use of norms that match one's values to predict the difficulties, benefits and therefore justification for pro-sustainability (in)action. Locally-held socio-cultural norms determine what is commonly (dis)approved of through reflective and comparative processes. Connectedness to the locality triggers empathy for nature and the local society, but not a corresponding sense of responsibility. This dissonance is managed by allocating responsibility to industry actors perceived as more powerful, particularly tour operators and consumers, and to the widespread greed and short term culture dominating the sector.

"Cardiovascular disease has the highest mortality rate than any other disease globally. Some major risk factors seem to be established in the early stages of life, suggesting preventive strategies as a major means to reduce cardiovascular mortality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of socioeconomic status and family characteristics on children's knowledge and perceptions concerning cardiovascular disease risk factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1,728 children (46% male) aged 10-12 years, attending Greek primary schools in Athens; Heraklion (capital city of the island of Crete); Kalamata; Pyrgos; and Sparti (Peloponnese peninsula), Greece. Sampling was conducted on school premises, during the school years 2014-15 and 2015-16 (participation rate, 95-100%). Data were collected via self-administered, anonymous questionnaire. Children's knowledge of various issues related to cardiovascular risk, such as nutrition, physical activity and smoking was also examined. Data on family characteristics were collected through another questionnaire completed by parents. Paternal education level and living with both parents instead of single-parent upbringing, were positively associated with children's knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors (b = 0.42; 95%CI: 0.01-0.83; P = 0.04; and b = 0.78; 95%CI: 0.013-1.43; P = 0.02 respectively). Moreover, children with more siblings seemed to have less sufficient knowledge compared with peers with fewer siblings (b per 1 sibling = -0.24; 95%CI: -0.47 to -0.014; P = 0.04). The present findings enhance the link between the micro-environment and children's knowledge and perceptions concerning cardiovascular health, providing information to health-care professionals while counseling youths."

"Poecilimon Fischer (Orthoptera, Tettigoniidae) consists of about 130 species and a functional taxonomy of the genus requires arranging species into phylogenetic groups. However, this is a task that requires detailed empirical testing. This paper documents data on Poecilimon species with an inflated pronotum. The Poecilimon (Poecilimon) inflatus group is a lineage ranging along a narrow zone in the south-west corner of Anatolia and in Crete plus some other Aegean islands. By producing data of morphology and calling songs of males and responding songs of females the composition and intra-group diversity of P. inflatus group are studied. Both morphology and male calling and female responding songs, exhibited a considerable intra-group diversity. In the light of data obtained the following nomenclatural changes were made. The genus Parapoecilimon Karabağ, 1975 syn. n. is synonymised with Poecilimon Fischer and Parapoecilimon antalyaensis Karabağ, 1975 is given a new combination, Poecilimon antalyaensis (Karabağ, 1975) comb. n. Four new taxa are described in the group: (i) Poecilimon isopterus sp.n.; (ii) Poecilimon inflatus lyciae subsp. n.; (iii) Poecilimon antalyaensis myrae subsp. n., and (iv) Poecilimon antalyaensis anemurium subsp. n. The Poecilimon (P.) inflatus species group consists of the following species: (i) Poecilimon inflatus Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1891; (ii) Poecilimon martinae Heller, 2004; (iii) Poecilimon cretensis Werner, 1903; (iv) Poecilimon antalyaensis (Karabağ, 1975) comb. n.; (v) Poecilimon bilgeri Karabağ, 1953 and (vi) Poecilimon isopterus sp.n. The species group is defined by a combination of characters including the pronotum inflated in metazona and a male cerci mostly black in their apical 1/2-1/3. The male calling song has typically two types of short syllables and the females respond acoustically with very short latency times. By using combination of morphology and song data we suggest three main lineages in the group: (i) P. bilgeri, (ii) P. antalyaensis and (iii) the other four species."

"<b>Background</b>  The gold standard for antenatal diagnosis of placenta previa is the transvaginal ultrasonography. In placenta previa cases, separation of placental and uterine tissues is challenging even for the most experienced surgeons. Life-threatening obstetrical complications from cesarean deliveries with placenta previa include peripartum hemorrhage, coagulopathy, blood transfusion, peripartum hysterectomy, and multiple organ failure. <b>Cases</b>  We detailed the 3 cases of placenta previa that underwent bilateral uterine artery ligation; if hemostasis was not achieved, horizontal mattress sutures were placed in the lower uterine segment. All patients were discharged with minimal morbidity. <b>Conclusion</b>  For patients with placenta previa and low risk for placenta creta, counseling should include the risk for maternal morbidity and criteria for pursuing peripartum hysterectomy. Our devascularization, a stepwise surgical approach, shows promising outcomes in placenta previa cases. <b>Précis</b>  We propose a novel surgical approach, using a progressive devascularization surgical technique, for management of women with placenta previa, undergoing cesarean delivery."

Recently, suicides in Greece have drawn national and international interest due to the current economic crisis. According to published reports, suicides in Greece have increased up to 40% and Crete has been highlighted as an area with the sharpest increase. To investigate the suicide mortality rates in Crete between 1999 and 2013 and their association with the economic crisis. Data on suicides were selected from the Department of Forensic Medicine files of the University of Crete. Our analysis showed that (1) Crete, has the highest suicide mortality rate in Greece, however no significant increase was observed between 1999 and 2013, (2) there were opposing trends between men and women, with women showing a decrease whereas men showed an increase in that period, (3) there was a significant increase of suicides in middle-aged men (40-64 yrs) and elderly, although the highest unemployment rates were observed in young men and women, and (4) finally, there was a regional shift of suicides with a significant decrease in Western Crete and a significant increase in Eastern Crete. Although, Crete has the highest suicide mortality rates in Greece, we did not observe an overall increase during the last 15 years, including the period of economic crisis. Furthermore, there was an increase in middle-aged and elderly men, whereas young men and women showed oppositional trends during the years of austerity. This may be related to the culturally different expectations for the two genders, as well as that younger individuals may find refuge to either strong family ties or by immigrating abroad. Finally, the relative increase of suicides in Eastern Crete may be explained by factors, such as the lack of community mental health services in that area.

The bivalves <i>Pillucina vietnamica</i> Zorina, 1978 and <i>Alveinus miliaceus</i> (Issel, 1869) were collected from sandy bottoms off Israel, whereas <i>Gregariella</i> cf. <i>ehrenbergi</i> (Issel, 1869) was recovered from a buoy originating from Port Said, Egypt, and stranded on the Israeli coast. The three species are first records for the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, we report range extensions for several gastropods: <i>Varicopeza pauxilla</i> (A. Adams, 1855) is recorded from Israel, <i>Phidiana militaris</i> (Alder and Hancock, 1864) from southern Israel (Ashqelon), and <i>Viriola</i> cf. <i>bayani</i> Jousseaume, 1884 from Israel and Crete. Shells and valves of an unidentified lucinid bivalve morphologically distinct from any known Mediterranean species were found along the Israeli Mediterranean shore.

Few series of osteomyelitis due to multi-drug (MDR) or extensively-drug resistant (XDR) gram-negative bacteria exist. A retrospective study of MDR and XDR gram-negative osteomyelitis cases was performed, aiming to investigate causative organisms, proper surgical and medical management, as well as outcome. All patients, treated at the University hospital of Crete between 2007 and 2016 for acute osteomyelitis, due to MDR or XDR gram-negative pathogens were evaluated. A total of 14 patients (8 males) were identified with a mean age of 50.6 years. Five Acinetobacter baumanii cases, 3 XDR and 2 MDR, were found. Furthermore, 3 MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae and 3 MDR Enterobacter cloacae isolates were identified. Additionally, 2 MDR Escherichia coli, as well as 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 XDR and 1 MDR, were isolated. One case of Roseomonas gilardii was also identified. In 5 cases the same pathogen was also isolated from blood. Five out of the 14 patients were smokers, 6 were suffering severe injury, 4 had diabetes-mellitus, 2 chronic renal disease and 2 were obese. Most causative organisms had hospital origin. All patients received first line empirical combination antimicrobial treatment, proven effective in 4. Thirteen patients were also subjected to surgical treatment. The study included mainly young individuals, most likely due to the high incidence of traffic accidents involving young adults in Crete. Antimicrobial regimens are important supplements to surgical treatment of acute osteomyelitis. However, due to emergence of resistant microorganisms, compliance with strict rules of antimicrobial strategy is of utmost importance.

Water scarcity in the Mediterranean region is becoming a growing concern, threatening the viability of agriculture, which is one of the main economic sectors in many areas. The design of an optimal irrigation management plan, based on state-of-the-art measuring and modeling tools, can effectively contribute towards water saving efforts and potentially address the water scarcity issue in the region. This paper describes the development and application of an integrated decision-making system for the management of water resources of olive and citrus crops in the North of Chania, Crete, Greece. The system integrates different field measurements, for example 2088 soil moisture measurements taken within the study area, and modeling approaches to simulate flow in the unsaturated zone. After the successful calibration and validation of the model, the spatio-temporal representation of soil moisture and pore water pressure were used as guidance for developing optimal irrigation plans, taking into account the water needs of olive and citrus crops, aiming to maximize crop yield, agricultural income, and promote water saving efforts. According to the results, water use can be reduced by up to 36% during the dry season, compared to conventional irrigation practices for citrus trees. Similarly, for olive trees, the reduction in water use can reach up to 41%. The proposed methodology can also be cost-effective in terms of water value, saving about 40% from the typical water cost for irrigation in the study area. The impact of climate change on water resources availability in the area and water conservation efforts were also investigated for the period of (2019-2030). Results show that, comparing the Baseline, RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 climatic scenarios, the highest savings on average are observed for emission scenario RCP 4.5 with 53.3% water savings for olive trees and 46.7% for citrus trees.

Nematode samplings in cultivated and wild olive in Crete, Greece, yielded the presence of Bitylenchus hispaniensis , Helicotylenchus microlobus , Helicotylenchus vulgaris , Merlinius brevidens , and Pratylenchoides alkani . With the exception of H. microlobus and M. brevidens , reports of these plant-parasitic nematode species constitute new records for Greece. Bitylenchus hispaniensis is also reported for first time in a country outside of Spain, where it was originally described. Pratylenchoides alkani is herein reported for the second time in the Mediterranean area and for the first time in association with olive. Two further populations of H. microlobus and H. vulgaris , from walnut and goji berry from Greece, were identified. Molecular data for all of these nematode species are provided, resulting in the first integrative identification of these Greek populations.

"Hippocrates, the father of medicine, had said: ""Wine is a thing wonderfully appropriate to man if, in health as in disease, it is administered with appropriate and just measure according to the individual constitution."" Wine has always accompanied humanity, for religion or for health. Christians and Jews need wine for the liturgy. For Plato, wine was an indispensable element in society and the most important in the symposium. In this second part of the banquet, mixed with water, the wine gave the word. If the French paradox made a lot of ink flow; it was the wine that was originally responsible for it. Many researchers have tried to study alcohol and polyphenols in wine, in order to solve the mystery. Beyond its cardiovascular effects, there are also effects on longevity, metabolism, cancer prevention, and neuroprotection, and the list goes on. The purpose of this work is to make an analysis of the current knowledge on the subject. Indeed, if the paradigm of antioxidants is seductive, it is perhaps by their prooxidant effect that the polyphenols act, by an epigenetic process mediated by nrf2. Wine is a preserve of antioxidants for the winter and it is by this property that the wine acts, in an alcoholic solution. A wine without alcohol is pure heresy. Wine is the elixir that by design, over millennials, has acted as a pharmacopeia that enabled man to heal and prosper on the planet. From Alvise Cornaro to Serge Renaud, nutrition was the key to health and longevity, whether the Cretan or Okinawa diet, it is the small dose of alcohol (wine or sake) that allows the bioavailability of polyphenols. Moderate drinking gives a protection for diseases and a longevity potential. In conclusion, let us drink fewer, but drink better, to live older."

"Based on adults, mature pupae, and larvae sampled at the same sites on mainland Greece and on the Greek islands of Kerkyra (Corfu) and Crete, the previously unknown larval stages of Rhyacophila tsurakiana Malicky 1984, R. gudrunae Malicky 1972, and R. biegelmeieri Malicky 1984 could be associated and identified. This material enabled us to describe and illustrate the final instar larvae of these three species, and to extract reliable diagnostic characters updating the existing larval key to the Greek species of genus Rhyacophila Stephens 1836 (Karaouzas et.al. 2015). In the context of this key, R. tsurakiana (together with R. tristis Pictet 1834 and R. obtusa Klapálek 1894) lacks abdominal gills; the three species can be separated by the shape of the dorsal sclerite of abdominal segment IX and by anal proleg morphology. Rhyacophila gudrunae is the only Greek species so far where larvae are fitted with one four-filament gill on each body side of the abdomen. Finally, R. biegelmeieri has one tufted multifilament gill on each body side and can be separated from four other species sharing this gill morphology by coloration patterns and head widths; however, separation from R. nubila Zetterstedt 1840 and R. palmeni McLachlan 1879 is not yet possible. Rhyacophila tsurakiana and R. biegelmeieri are large-scale endemic caddisfly species of European Ecoregion 6 (Hellenic Western Balkan), whereas R. gudrunae is a micro-endemic species of this region and restricted to the island of Crete (Malicky 2005b; Graf et al. 2008)."

A bathymetric transect in the north coast of Crete first studied in 1989, was revisited 24 years later. Identical sampling design, season, techniques and protocols were followed in both studies in order to minimize bias in the long-term comparisons. This comprehensive macrofaunal dataset (4 stations, 2 sampling seasons, 7 replicates in each study) revealed changes in benthic diversity and community composition between the sampling periods. The recorded changes were higher at the stations located close to the coastal zone. In addition, while benthic communities showed lower total abundance during the recent sampling period, species abundances were more evenly distributed indicating that some species dominated the historical communities. In spite of these changes, the ecological status remained above the threshold values for good ecological status. The results indicated that changes in the benthic community seem to have been driven by local anthropogenic factors and natural variability rather than by large-scale factors such as nutrients influxes in the entire Mediterranean Basin.

Data from the Cretan Lupus Epidemiology and Surveillance Registry. 	Examining urban-rural differences can provide insights into susceptibility or modifying factors of complex diseases, yet limited data exist on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To study SLE risk, manifestations and severity in relation to urban versus rural residence. Cross-sectional analysis of the Crete Lupus Registry. Demographics, residency history and clinical data were obtained from interviews and medical records ( N=399 patients). Patients with exclusively urban, rural or mixed urban/rural residence up to enrolment were compared. The risk of SLE in urban versus rural areas was 2.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.66-2.61). Compared with rural, urban residence was associated with earlier (by almost seven years) disease diagnosis - despite comparable diagnostic delay - and lower female predominance (6.8:1 versus 15:1). Rural patients had fewer years of education and lower employment rates. Smoking was more frequent among urban, whereas pesticide use was increased among rural patients. A pattern of malar rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers and arthritis was more prevalent in rural patients. Residence was not associated with organ damage although moderate/severe disease occurred more frequently among rural-living patients (multivariable adjusted odds ratio: 2.17, p=0.011). Our data suggest that the living environment may influence the risk, gender bias and phenotype of SLE, not fully accounted for by sociodemographic factors.

"Greece experienced the largest European West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak in 2010 since the 1996 Romania epidemic. West Nile virus reemerged in southern Greece during 2017, after a 2-year hiatus of recorded human cases, and herein laboratory findings, clinical features, and geographic distribution of WNV cases are presented. Clinical specimens from patients with clinically suspected WNV infection were sent from local hospitals to the Microbiology Department of Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and were tested for the presence of specific anti-WNV antibodies and WNV RNA. From July to September 2017, 45 confirmed or probable WNV infection cases were identified; 43 of them with an acute/recent infection, of which 24 (55.8%) experienced WNV neuroinvasive disease (WNND). Risk factors for developing WNND included advanced age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. A total of four deaths (16.7%) occurred, all in elderly patients aged &gt; 70 years. Thirty-nine cases were identified in regional units that had not been affected before (36 in Argolis and two in Corinth, northeastern Peloponnese, and one in Rethymno, Crete). The remaining four cases were reported from previously affected regional units of northwestern Peloponnese. The reemergence of WNV after a 2-year hiatus of recorded human cases and the spread of the virus in newly affected regions of the country suggests that WNV has been established in Greece and disease transmission will continue in the future. Epidemiological surveillance, intensive mosquito management programs, and public awareness campaigns about personal protective measures are crucial to the prevention of WNV transmission."

"Few studies have investigated longitudinal associations between early life phthalate exposure and subsequent obesity and cardiovascular risks in children with inconsistent results. We aimed to evaluate the associations between phthalate exposure during gestation and childhood with offspring obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors in 500 mother-child pairs from the Rhea pregnancy cohort in Crete, Greece. Seven phthalate metabolites [monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP)] were quantified in spot urine samples collected from mothers (1st trimester) and their children at 4 years of age. We calculated the molar sum of DEHP metabolites (MEHP, MEHHP, MEOHP). We measured child weight, height, waist circumference, skinfold thicknesses, blood pressure (BP), and lipids at 4 and 6 years and leptin, adiponectin, and C-reactive protein at 4 years. We used generalized estimating equations to examine associations at each age and tested for interaction by sex. Child exposure to phthalate metabolites was associated with lower BMI z-scores in boys and higher BMI z-scores in girls. Each 10-fold increase in ΣDEHP was associated with a change in waist circumference of -2.6 cm (95% CI: -4.72, -0.48) in boys vs. 2.14 cm (95% CI: -0.14, 4.43) in girls (<i>p</i>-sex interaction = 0.003) and a change in waist-to-height ratio of -0.01 (95% CI: -0.03, 0.01) in boys vs. 0.02 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.04) in girls (<i>p</i>-sex interaction = 0.006). Phthalate metabolite concentrations at age 4 were negatively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure. MEP was associated with lower systolic BP z-scores (adj. β = -0.22; 95% CI: -0.36, -0.08) at 4 years. MnBP and MBzP were associated with lower diastolic BP z-scores (adj. β = -0.13; 95%CI: -0.23, -0.04, and adj. β = -0.11; 95% CI: -0.21, -0.01, respectively). A 10-fold increase in MiBP was associated with 4.4% higher total cholesterol levels (95% CI: 0.2, 8.7). Prenatal phthalate exposure was not consistently associated with child adiposity and cardiometabolic measures. Our findings suggest that early life phthalate exposure may affect child growth and adiposity in a sex-specific manner and depends on the timing of exposure."

Tree Wormwood (Artemisia arborescens L.) is a Mediterranean medicinal herb known for its anti-inflammatory properties, mainly because of the high chamazulene content of its essential oil (EO). Herein are presented the results of an investigation concerning the seasonal variation in the chamazulene content of.the EOs of three Cretan natural populations of A. arborescens by combined GC-FID and GC-MS analysis. Results highlighted a population containing EO rich in chamazulene at amounts exceeding 50% of its quantitative composition at the full flowering stage, which is the more appropriate vegetative stage for harvesting. Hydro-distillation of the respective plant material in five different pH environments increased, in all cases, the chamazulene yield, with the most efficient pH value being 8.3, when the chamazulene amount increased 1.3 times compared with distillation under neutral conditions, reaching 65.1% of the total content of EO.

This special issue on 'Cytokines in Liver Diseases' was inspired by many talks and presentations on liver cancer during the 2nd Aegean Conference on Cytokine Signaling in Cancer (ACCSC) held at Heraklion, Crete, Greece on May 30-June 04, 2017 (Cytokine 2018, 108: 225-231). The liver is the biggest blood filtration and detoxification unit, and is a vital metabolic organ. Being constantly exposed to potentially harmful dietary chemicals, drugs, alcohol abuse and pathogens, the liver displays an extraordinary capacity to repair tissue damage and to regenerate. Moreover, only a healthy liver can provide the vast majority of plasma proteins, plus serving as a key organ for body homeostasis and metabolic fitness. Occasionally, the liver may have to deal with chronic damage inflicted by hepatotropic infections such as hepatitis viruses and metabolic derangements caused by obesity and the consequent metabolic syndrome. Overwhelming the natural defenses of the liver can compromise its vital functions and this can lead to more severe liver disease such as fibrosis that may progress towards cirrhosis and eventually to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, in obesity, a worldwide crisis that has been developing during the last few decades, HCC can develop in the fatty liver bypassing the fibrosis and cirrhosis stages. With the availability of effective therapies and vaccination strategies for hepatitis viruses, over nutrition has become the biggest new threat for a healthy liver. Cytokines and chemokines play a key role in the initiation and perpetuation of acute and chronic injury to the liver, and thus they contribute to most liver pathologies. The topic of cytokines in liver diseases is so vast that it cannot be adequately covered in this special issue. However, we have attempted to provide a glimpse of hot topics through comprehensive reviews and a few accompanying original articles on key research areas.

"Cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) presence was investigated in the muscle tissue of gilthead seabream and seabass, collected from various aquaculture sites of the Aegean and Cretan Sea as well as from the fish market (fisheries). Risk for the Greek population through consumption of these species was estimated using two approaches: Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) and Hazard Index (HI). All heavy metal levels in the fish tissue were below the established safe limits for consumption. Metal accumulation was found to differ amongst mode of production, species, location and seasonality. Seabass demonstrated higher Hg and lower Cd concentrations than seabream, Hg and Pb seem to be more accumulated in closed seas and Pb values displayed a linear increasing trend from warmer to colder periods. Regression analysis revealed that the main contributing factor to Cd accumulation is species (beta: -0.28, 95%CI: -0.48 to -0.09); lead is predominately affected by seasonality (beta: 0.44, 95%CI: 0.29 to 0.59), Hg accumulation is mainly affected by location (beta: -0.32, 95%CI: -0.61 to -0.03) while wild seabream accumulates greater levels for Hg and Pb than farmed. Risk analysis demonstrated that consumption of the studied species, is safe for all metals (HI &lt; 0.460 and TTHQ &lt; 0.299)."

"This communication reports skeletal pathology in a Pleistocene endemic deer from the Mavromouri caves of Crete. 287 bones and bone fragments from Mavromouri caves are compared to 2986 bones from Liko Cave. Bones were evaluated macroscopically, and measurements were made of morphometric characteristics of limb long bones. Representative bone specimens were examined radiographically and histologically. Macroscopic hallmarks were loss of bone mass and increased porosity. The long bones were brittle, some of them having thin cortices, and others reduction of medullary cavities that contain dense Haversian tissue. The flat bones were spongy and fragile. Erosions of the metaphyses and articular surfaces were noted. Histological findings included: sub-periosteal resorption; loss of lamellar bone; enlargement of vascular canals; and remodeling of cortical bone. Two types of fibrous osteodystrophy were recognized in skeletal remains, subostotic and hyperostotic. The deer of Mavromouri caves were affected by severe metabolic bone disease, likely nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism. We hypothesize a multifactorial cause, including overgrazing, flora senescence, soil mineral deficiencies, and a prolonged period of climate extremes, degrading the Cretan deer habitat. This is the first evidence of a metabolic bone disease causing this level of destructive pathology in an insular fossil deer. The lack of absolute chronometric dates for the site limits potential linking with the prevailing environmental conditions. Investigation of similar skeletal pathologies at other islands or isolated habitats is advised."

Pneumococcal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in patients with comorbidities and advanced age. This study evaluated trends in epidemiology of adult pneumococcal disease in Crete, Greece, by identifying serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance of consecutive <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> strains isolated from adults during an 8-year time period (2009-2016) and the indirect effect of the infant pneumococcal higher-valent conjugate vaccines 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed by E-test and serotyping by Quellung reaction. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-susceptibility to penicillin (PNSP) combined with resistance to ≥2 non-β-lactam antimicrobials. A total of 135 <i>S. pneumoniae</i> strains were isolated from adults during the study period. Twenty-one serotypes were identified with 17F, 15A, 3, 19A, and 11A, being the most common. The coverage rates of PCV10, and PCV13 were 17.8% and 37.8%, respectively. PCV13 serotypes decreased significantly from 68.4% in 2009 to 8.3% in 2016 (<i>P</i> = 0.002). The most important emerging non-PCV13 serotypes were 17F, 15A, and 11A, with 15A being strongly associated with antimicrobial resistance and MDR. Among all study isolates, penicillin-resistant and MDR strains represented 7.4% and 14.1%, respectively. Predominant PNSP serotypes were 19A (21.7%), 11A (17.4%), and 15A (17.4%). Erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and levofloxacin resistant rates were 30.4%, 15.6%, 16.3%, 16.3%, and 1.5%, respectively. Although pneumococcal disease continues to be a health burden in adults in Crete, our study reveals a herd protection effect of the infant pneumococcal higher-valent conjugate vaccination. Surveillance of changes in serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance among pneumococcal isolates are necessary to guide optimal prevention and treatment strategies.

"The effects of the Greek economic crisis on the emergency departments (EDs) of public hospitals have not been evaluated. The study aims to evaluate the burden of the financial crisis on public hospital's EDs. The present study is a retrospective two-center comparative study. ED visits, related admissions per year, and the admissions/visits ratio at two public Greek hospitals, the Sismanogleio of Athens (SHA) and the University Hospital of Crete (UHC), from 2008 to 2016 were retrospectively studied. A linear model was fitted for each variable, and the slope values of the linear equations were calculated and compared between the two institutions. ED visits of the UHC exhibited 8.9% increase during the study period, whereas related admissions and admissions/visits ratio increased by 23.4% and 12.5%, respectively. ED visits at the SHA exhibited 5.4% increase, whereas related admissions showed 6% decrease and the admissions/visits ratio was decreased by 8%. Significant differences between the rates of admissions (P &lt; 0.001) and admissions/visits ratio (P = 0.001) among the two hospitals were observed. Both institutions showed similarly increased ED visits. However, the UHC serving mainly rural, but also suburban and urban population, exhibited different changes regarding admissions and admissions/visits ratio compared with the SHA serving mainly an urban and suburban one, reflecting the way the crisis affected each social group. Depression has amplified the Greek National Health System structural problems and exposed the problematic urban primary health care. Improvement of primary urban health care, autonomy of EDs, and establishment of emergency medicine as independent specialty in Greece could serve better patients seeking care in public hospitals' EDs."

Endometriosis is an enigmatic condition with an unknown etiology and a poorly understood pathogenesis. It is considered to appear from the interplay of many genetic and environmental factors, affecting up to 10% of women and represents a major cause of pain and infertility. The familial association of endometriosis, as demonstrated through monozygotic twin and family studies suggests a genetic contribution to the disease, with further case‑control and genome‑wide association studies (GWAS) detecting various endometriosis risk factors. In a recent study, we described a unique, three‑generation family of Cretan origin (Greece) with 7 females with surgically confirmed endometriosis (grandmother, 3 daughters and 3 granddaughters). All the affected members of this family displayed a variety of clinical manifestations and complications. In the present study, to further analyze the genetic variants conferring the risk of developing endometriosis, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed, using the AmpliSeq technology on the Ion Proton platform. An initial analysis of 64 variants that were detected across the 14 genes previously confirmed to be associated with endometriosis, did not identify any deleterious exonic variants in these genes. However, further analysis revealed 2 hemizygous deletions in the grandmother that segregate in several of her affected offspring. The first deletion was found in the UGT2B28 locus, spanning 7 informative sequence variants across at least 14 kb. The second deletion, located in USP17L2, spans 3 informative variants across at least 2 kb. On the whole, the findings of the presents study implicate 2 additional genes in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, apart from those already identified by GWAS.

"This paper describes the previously unknown larvae of three Beraeidae species restricted to Greece: Beraeamyia aphyrte Malicky 1972, Bm. kutsaftikii Malicky 1975, and Bm. matsakii Malicky 1980 (Trichoptera: Beraeidae). Information on the morphology of the larvae is given, and the most important diagnostic features are illustrated. The trio of species can be easily separated by an angle present in the dorsal outline of the pronotal carina in Bm. kutsaftikii whereas this dorsal outline is straight in the remaining two species. Finally, the dorsal ridge of the pronotal carina touches the dorsal ecdysial line in Bm. matsakii, but fades far away from the ecdysial line in Bm. aphyrte. With respect to distribution, Bm. kutsaftikii is restricted to the mountains of Central Greece, the Peloponnesos, and the island of Euboea; Bm. matsakii is an endemic of the Ochi mountains in the southern part of Euboea and the island of Andros; and Bm. aphyrte is an endemic of the island of Crete. The species are integrated in a synoptic discriminatory matrix including the currently known Greek Beraeidae larvae. In addition, ecological information on the species is provided."

"Group B streptococcus (GBS) remains a leading cause of neonatal disease. However, GBS rates and prevention strategies vary considerably worldwide. Herein, we investigated the burden and epidemiological trends of neonatal GBS infections in our area (Greece) over the last two decades. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study that includes all cases of culture-proven GBS disease in infants &lt;90 days old in the last 22 years. Neonatal GBS incidence was 0.17/1000 live births (95%CI: 0.11-0.21). A significant increase was noted during the second decade (0.23 <i>vs</i> 0.10/1000, P&lt;0.05). Late onset disease (LOD) significantly increased during the second decade (0.08 <i>vs</i> 0.02, P&lt;0.05). Infants in the LOD group had a higher risk of meningitis (RR 1.8, 95%CI: 1.23-2.71). Long-term neurological sequelae were reported in 42.8% of meningitis cases. The mortality rate was 8%. The incidence of neonatal GBS disease in our area is among the lowest reported, but an increase was noted the last decade mainly due a rise in the LOD. The burden of LOD, the mortality and long-term disability are still substantial, thus effective prevention strategies - including maternal vaccination for neonatal GBS - are needed."

"Botrytis cinerea is a pathogen with high genetic variability that has also shown high risk for fungicide resistance development. In total, 1,169 isolates obtained from strawberry (n = 297) and tomato (n = 872) in five geographic regions of Greece were tested for their sensitivity to several botryticides. A high frequency of isolates with multiple resistance to carbendazim, cyprodinil, pyraclostrobin, and boscalid was found in isolates from strawberry. In the isolates from tomato, the predominant phenotype was that of dual resistance to carbendazim and cyprodinil in the Crete island, of single resistance to carbendazim in the region of Preveza, and of sensitive isolates in the region of Kyparissia. None of the tested isolates was found to be fludioxonil resistant. High frequencies of boscalid-resistant phenotypes were observed in the strawberry isolates, while boscalid-resistance frequency in the tomato isolates was lower. H272R was the predominant sdhB mutation, associated with resistance to boscalid, in all the sampled isolates, while other sdhB mutations were found at low frequencies. B. cinerea group S, identified by the presence of a 21-bp insertion in the transcription factor mrr1 gene, was predominant within the tomato isolates obtained from all three sampled regions, with frequencies ranging from 62 to 75% of the isolates; whereas, within strawberry isolates, B. cinerea was predominant, with frequencies of 75 to 95%. Correlations of isolate genotype and fungicide resistance profile showed that B. cinerea sensu stricto isolates were more prone to the development of resistance to boscalid compared with the Botrytis group S isolates, which may explain the observed predominance of B. cinerea sensu stricto in strawberry fields."
PMID:30699602	Ligoxigakis EK, Markakis EA, Papaioannou IA, Typas MA	Plant Dis. 99(2):286	2015	First Report of Powdery Mildew of Platanus × acerifolia and P. occidentalis Caused by Erysiphe platani in Greece. 	"London planetrees (Platanus × acerifolia, syn. P. × hispanica), American sycamores (P. occidentalis), and oriental planes (P. orientalis) are widely planted as urban shade trees throughout Greece and many other countries. In June 2012, typical symptoms of a powdery mildew were detected on all sycamores (10 trees) along a central avenue of Heraklion (Crete, Greece), with the disease affecting approximately 80% of the leaves of all infected trees. In August 2013, similar symptoms were observed on 20% of the leaves of all three London planes in a small grove in the Vrysses area of Lasithi (Crete, Greece). In both cases, the disease was severe, with white superficial colonies developing amphigenously on leaves, twigs, floral peduncles, inflorescences, and fruits. The colonies were initially distinct and circular but gradually enlarged and often coalesced to cover the entire leaf blade. Young leaves appeared curled and chlorotic, occasionally leading to defoliation. For the morphological description of the pathogen, samples from seven infected P. occidentalis and three P. × acerifolia trees were microscopically characterized. In all samples, the pathogen's mycelium was branched, septate, and hyaline, with lobed appressoria; conidiophores were erect, cylindrical, unbranched, and consisted of three to four (to five) cells; and conidia were single or in short chains (two to four), ellipsoid or doliiform, with a truncated base and rounded apex. Their dimensions were 24.3 to 48.6 × 15.8 to 27.9 μm (averaging 39.2 × 21.2 μm; n = 100), and their surfaces appeared reticulate. The teleomorph was never observed. Total fungal DNA was extracted from conidia harvested from affected leaves of one infected plant of each of P. occidentalis and P. × acerifolia planes, and the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was PCR-amplified with universal primers 18S-ITS1 and 28S-ITS2 (2) and sequenced (GenBank Accession Nos. KM068123 and KM068124, respectively). A BLASTn search of GenBank revealed 100% identity of both samples to Erysiphe platani strains described on P. orientalis in Greece (JQ365943) and P. occidentalis in Brazil (KF499270). Based on the morphological and molecular analyses, the pathogen was identified as E. platani (Howe) U. Braun &amp; S. Takam. (formerly known as Microsphaera platani Howe) (1). To prove pathogenicity and fulfill Koch's postulates, 10 1-year-old seedlings of each of P. occidentalis and P. × acerifolia hosts were artificially inoculated with conidia obtained from naturally infected plants of the corresponding species, with two methods: (i) five plants of each host were dusted with conidia from diseased leaves, and (ii) the remaining five seedlings of each plane were sprayed with a conidial suspension of the fungus (10<sup>7</sup> conidia ml<sup>-1</sup>), while five additional control plants of each species were treated only with sterile distilled water. All plants were maintained in the greenhouse at 25 ± 3°C, with 90% humidity. Powdery mildew symptoms, which appeared 9 and 15 days after inoculation on all dusted and sprayed plants, respectively, were similar to those observed on naturally infected trees, whereas no symptoms were observed on control plants. Although E. platani is known to infect plane species in several parts of the world (1), including oriental planes (P. orientalis and P. orientalis var. cretica) in Greece (3), this is the first report of E. platani causing disease of P. occidentalis and P. × acerifolia in Greece, underlining the need for appropriate control measures to prevent significant losses to the local ornamental industry.

PMID:30699797	Markakis EA, Kavroulakis N, Koubouris GC	Plant Dis. 98(11):1584	2014	First Report of Verticillium Wilt Caused by Verticillium dahliae on Avocado Trees in Greece. 	Avocado (Persea americana) is an important crop for Chania, Crete, Greece, and is grown on more than 800 ha. In November 2013, 4-year-old trees in a new avocado grove of cv. Hass grafted onto the rootstock 'Bacon,' previously planted in citrus trees, showed symptoms of yellowing, leaf fall, twig and branch dieback and vascular tissue discoloration. Disease incidence was estimated at 2.3% (12 out of 530 trees affected). A fungus was consistently and readily isolated from symptomatic vascular tissue, previously surface-disinfested with 95% ethanol, on acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA). After 7 days, slow-growing colonies were transferred to PDA and the growth rate of the fungus was 2.9 mm/day at 24°C in the dark. Microscopic observations revealed hyaline hyphae with many irregular, dark microsclerotia measuring 40 to 200 × 30 to 75 μm (average 94.5 × 50.3 μm) developing after 21 days of growth. Hyaline, elliptical, single-celled conidia measuring 2.8 to 7.5 × 2.5 to 4.3 μm (average 4.8 × 3.1 μm) developed on verticillate conidiophores. For molecular characterization, Verticillium dahliae specific primer pair ITS1-F/ITS2-R that amplifies the rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was used (2). Band of expected size was amplified, sequenced, and deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KJ818294). On the basis of morphological characteristics (3) and a BLAST search with 100% identity to the published ITS sequence of a V. dahliae isolate in GenBank (KC834733.1), the fungus was identified as V. dahliae. Five 1-year-old avocado plants of cv. Hass, grafted onto the rootstock 'Bacon,' were used for pathogenicity tests. Artificial inoculation was performed by making a 5.0 × 3.5 mm hole in the rootstock trunk, injecting approximately 40 μl of a 2.8 × 10<sup>7</sup> conidia/ml suspension into the vessels (spores were introduced passively), sealing with Vaseline, and covering with adhesive paper tape. Five control plants were mock inoculated with sterilized distilled water. Disease symptoms that appeared 18 days post artificial inoculation were similar to those observed under natural infection conditions. Thirty-five days post artificial inoculation, disease incidence was 80%, whereas the percentage of positive V. dahliae re-isolations from infected tissues was 95% (96.7 and 93.3% from rootstock and graft, respectively). The extent of vascular tissue discoloration from the point of inoculation ranged from 11 to 62 cm, whereas V. dahliae was successfully re-isolated even from the end of the graft (approximately 60 cm above the initial inoculation point), thus confirming Koch's postulates. Neither symptoms nor positive isolations were observed in control plants. The pathogenicity test was repeated twice with similar results. Verticillium wilt of avocado has been observed in several countries including Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Israel, Mexico, Morocco, Spain, and the United States (1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Verticillium wilt on avocado in Greece. This disease could potentially be an increasing problem in areas where young avocado trees are established on land previously planted in vegetable crops. References: (1) J. C. Goud and J. A.

PMID:30703984	Orfanidou C, Maliogka VI, Katis NI	Plant Dis. 98(10):1446	2014	First Report of Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus in Cucumber, Melon, and Watermelon in Greece. 	"In 2011, an outbreak of a yellowing disease causing chlorosis and Interveinal chlorotic spots on lower leaves was observed in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and melon (C. melo) plants in two greenhouses on the island of Rhodes, Greece. Similar symptoms were observed in 2012 in open field watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) plants in Rhodes and in November 2013 in a cucumber greenhouse in Tympaki, Crete. Disease incidence ranged from 10 to 40%. The observed symptoms were similar to those caused by whitefly transmitted criniviruses (family Closteroviridae) Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV) and Beet pseudo-yellows virus (BPYV), as well as Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV), a recently described crinivirus that infects cucurbits in Japan (4) and by the aphid transmitted polerovirus (family Luteoviridae) Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV). Dense populations of whiteflies were present in all the affected crops. Leaf samples from cucumber (10 from Rhodes and 10 from Crete), melon (10), and watermelon (10) were collected and tested for the presence of the above viruses. Total RNA was extracted from the samples (2) and detection of BPYV, CYSDV, and CABYV was done as previously described (1,3) whereas detection of CCYV was conducted by herein developed two-step RT-PCR assays. Two new pairs of primers, 'CC-HSP-up' (5'-GAAGAGATGGGTTGGTGTAGATAAA-3')/'CC-HSP-do' (5'-CACACCGATTTCATAAACATCCTTT-3') and 'CC-RdRp-up' (5'-CCTAATATTGGAGCTTATGAGTACA-3')/'CC-RdRp-do' (5'-CATACACTTTAAACACAACCCC-3') were designed based on GenBank deposited sequences of CCYV for the amplification of two regions partially covering the heat shock protein 70 homologue (HSP70h) (226 bp) and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes (709 bp). Interestingly, CCYV was detected in all samples tested, while CYSDV was detected in 18 cucumbers (10 from Rhodes and 8 from Crete), 1 melon, and 3 watermelon plants. Neither BPYV nor CABYV were detected. In order to verify the presence of CCYV, the partial HSP70h and RdRp regions of a cucumber isolate from Crete were directly sequenced using the primers 'CC-HSP-up'/'CC-HSP-do' and 'CC-RdRp-up'/'CC-RdRp-do'. BLAST analysis of the obtained sequences (HG939521 and 22) showed 99% and 100% identities with the HSP70h and RdRp of cucumber CCYV isolates from Lebanon, respectively (KC990511 and 22). Also, the partial HSP70h sequence of a watermelon CCYV isolate from Rhodes showed 99% identity with the cucumber isolate from Crete. Whitefly transmission of CCYV was also carried out by using an infected cucumber from Crete as virus source. Four groups of 30 whitefly adults of Bemisia tabaci biotype Q were given an acquisition and inoculation access time of 48 and 72 h, respectively. Each whitefly group was transferred to a healthy cucumber plant (hybrid Galeon). Two weeks post inoculation, the plants, which have already been showing mild interveinal chlorosis, were tested for virus presence by RT-PCR. CCYV was successfully transmitted in three of four inoculated cucumbers, which was further confirmed by sequencing. In Greece, cucurbit yellowing disease has occurred since the 1990s, with CYSDV, BPYV, and CABYV as causal agents. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CCYV infecting cucurbits in Greece; therefore, our finding supports the notion that the virus is spreading in the Mediterranean basin and is an important pathogen in cucurbit crops.

PMID:30708435	Vakalounakis DJ, Doulis AG, Lamprou KK	Plant Dis. 98(3):425	2014	First Report of Powdery Scab, Caused by Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea, on Potatoes in Crete, Greece. 	In February 2013, severe symptoms of the powdery scab canker type were observed during harvesting at the Mallia area of Heraklio, Crete, Greece, on approximately 20% of the tubers of two commercial smooth skinned potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) field crops (cv. Spunta), of which the seeds had been imported from the Netherlands. Initially, small (up to 2 mm diameter), sunken, purple-brown lesions appeared before harvest on the tubers, followed by pimple-like swellings, which increased in size. As lesions matured, they broke through the tuber skin and developed into shallow depressions. Lesions often expanded in depth and width, forming deep pits and open cankers, eventually destroying considerable amounts of tuber tissue. Light microscopic preparations showed the presence of spongy spore balls with a honeycomb-like spore wall structure. Spore balls were golden brown to brown, oval, circular, elongate, pyriform or irregular in shape, and 54.2 ± 0.93 (36.3 to 79.9) × 47.8 ± 0.82 (31.5 to 72.6) μm. These were composed of aggregates of hundreds of spores that were circular to polygonal in shape, and 4.5 ± 0.06 (3.5 to 5.6) μm in diameter. The morphological characteristics closely resembled those reported for the powdery scab pathogen Spongospora subterranea (Wallr.) Lagerheim f. sp. subterranea Tomlinson. Pathogenicity was confirmed by a lab-based bioassay (3), where spore balls scraped from tuber scab lesions were used to inoculate 20 tomato (cv. Earlypak) bait seedlings, while 20 other seedlings were employed as non-inoculated controls. Zoosporangia of S. subterranea were observed microscopically in root hairs and epidermal cells of all inoculated seedlings but not of any control plants 2 weeks after inoculation. The identity of the pathogen was also confirmed in the original potato samples employing Sss AgriStrip (BIOREBA AG, Reinach, Switzerland), an immunological assay specific for S. subterranea resting spores. In addition, DNA was extracted from infected tubers and the region corresponding to the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene regions was amplified (1). PCR products were purified, direct sequenced, and deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KF208654). In a BLASTn search, the 18S (partial)-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (partial) sequence stretch showed 95% similarity to a 509-bp sequence (AF102820.1) of the corresponding S. subterranea gene in GenBank (query coverage 98% and E value 0.0). Based on morphological characteristics, pathogenicity test, immunological assay, and molecular data, it was concluded that the pathogen on potato in Crete is S. subterranea f. sp. subterranea. Powdery scab of potatoes by S. subterranea had been reported earlier in some areas of Greece (Argolida, Attica, Kefallinia, Messenia, and Salonika) (2,4), but without any data confirming the identity of the pathogen. To our knowledge, this is the first record in the island of Crete, and the first confirmed report of this pathogen in Greece. Because S. subterranea f. sp. subterranea is a destructive pathogen of potatoes, its presence in Crete could be of significant concern for commercial growers. Consequently seed import regulations should be strictly enforced. References: (1) K. S. Bell et al. Eur. J. Plant Path. 105:905, 1999. (2) C. D. Holevas et al. Ann. Inst. Phytopath.

"In July 2007, a severe petiole (rachis) blight disease was observed on several California fan palms (Washingtonia filifera) in the vicinity of Heraklion (Crete), Greece. Typical symptoms included discolored (brown to reddish-brown), reversed V-shaped lesions on the petiole bases of the oldest (lowest) leaves, and elongated yellow to dark-brown stripes along the petiole. The lesions progressively expanded and penetrated the petioles, resulting in gradual discoloration (from tan to brown-black) of the internal petiole tissues, including the vascular tissue. The bases of infected petioles occasionally became fragile and burst open, while the corresponding leaf blades were characterized initially by yellowing and one-sided or uneven wilt and, later, desiccation and death with the entire leaves curving downwards. The disease gradually moved upward to younger leaves, severely debilitating but rarely killing the infected trees. A filamentous fungus was consistently isolated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates from sections of diseased petioles, forming dense, dark green colonies with abundant light to dark brown, subglobose pycnidia (diameter ranging between 36.4 to 177.4 μm, and averaging 99.4 μm, n = 50) on the agar surface or immersed in the medium. Chlamydospores and numerous dictyochlamydospores were also observed, with the latter being initially light to dark brown and later becoming black. The numerous conidia were hyaline, ovoid to ellipsoid, and single-celled. Their dimensions were 5.3 to 7.3 × 2.4 to 4.9 μm, averaging 6.5 × 3.2 μm (n = 100). The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region, together with parts of the flanking 18S and 28S rRNA genes (3), were amplified with PCR from total DNA extracted from two representative isolates, and sequenced (GenBank Accession Nos. KC802086 to KC802087). Using BLASTn, both sequences were 100% identical to Phoma glomerata ITS sequences (FJ427018, FJ427011, AF126816). Based on morphological and molecular analyses, the pathogen was identified as Phoma glomerata (Corda) Wollenw. &amp; Hochapfel, also known as Peyronellaea glomerata (Corda) Goid. ex Togliani or Coniothyrium glomeratum Corda (1,2). To prove pathogenicity and fulfill Koch's postulates, petioles of the older leaves of eight W. filifera 2-year-old seedlings were wounded with a sterile scalpel (shallow cuts 0.5 to 1.0 cm wide, made parallel to the surface), inoculated with agar discs from a 2-week-old PDA culture of the fungus, and sealed with Parafilm. For controls, sterile PDA plugs were placed on the artificial wounds of five more seedlings. All plants were maintained in the greenhouse at 15 ± 5°C, with 90% humidity. Petiole blight and leaf necrosis symptoms-identical to those observed in the infected plants-were evident 5 weeks post-inoculation, and P. glomerata was consistently reisolated from all inoculated plants. No symptoms were observed on control plants. This is the first report of petiole blight of a palm species caused by P. glomerata in Greece. Due to the extensive use of palms as ornamentals in Greece, the occurrence of P. glomerata can potentially cause economic loss to the local ornamental industry. References: (1) M. M. Aveskamp et al.

PMID:30708557	Fiallo-Olivé E, Katis NI, Navas-Castillo J	Plant Dis. 98(5):700	2014	First Report of Sweet potato leaf curl virus on Blue Morning Glory in Greece. 	Blue morning glory (Ipomoea indica, Convolvulaceae) plants are widespread along the Greek coast, where they grow as weeds in addition to being cultivated as ornamentals. Yellow vein symptoms are frequently observed on these plants. These symptoms are similar to those reported for isolates of Sweet potato leaf curl virus (SPLCV) infecting I. indica in Italy and Spain (1,3). SPLCV belongs to the sweepoviruses, a unique group within the genus Begomovirus in the family Geniminiviridae that infects sweet potato (I. batatas) crops around the world. In May 2013, three leaf samples of I. indica showing yellow vein symptoms were collected in Kolymbari (Crete Island), where ~50% of the observed plants were symptomatic, and five asymptomatic leaf samples were collected in Kremasti and Mandriko (Rhodes Island). Total DNA, isolated from all samples, was used as a template in rolling-circle amplification (RCA) using ϕ29 DNA polymerase (TempliPhi kit, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and the product was digested with a set of restriction endonucleases. The samples from Kolymbari and one sample from Kremasti yielded amplification products that were shown to contain a single BamHI site. The DNA fragments of ~2.8 kbp obtained from one sample from each island were cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Inserts of two clones from the Kolymbari sample and one clone from the Kremasti sample were completely sequenced (Macrogen, Seoul, South Korea). Sequences were aligned with available sequences of sweepoviruses using MUSCLE and pairwise identity scores were calculated with SDT as described (4). The sequences obtained from Kolymbari (2,830 nt, GenBank Accession Nos. KF697069 and KF697070) were 98.8% similar between them and showed the highest nucleotide identity (97.7%) with a SPLCV isolate obtained from an I. indica plant in Sicily Island (Italy) (AJ586885) (1). The sequence obtained from Kremasti (2,804 nt, KF697071) showed the highest nucleotide identity (92.4%) with a SPLCV isolate (previously named as Ipomoea yellow vein virus, which is currently a synonym of SPLCV [2]) obtained from an I. indica plant from southern Spain (EU839578) (3). Nucleotide sequence identities were above the 91% threshold for begomovirus species demarcation (2), thus confirming that the begomoviruses found infecting I. indica in Greece are isolates of SPLCV. It is worth to note that the infected I. indica plant from Kremasti did not show any conspicuous symptoms, thus highlighting the importance of this species as an alternative host for SPLCV, which could thus affect the sweet potato crop that is grown in Greece in familiar plots. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SPLCV in Greece. References: (1) R. W. Briddon et al. Plant Pathol. 55:286, 2006. (2) ICTV Geminiviridae Study Group.

Orobanche and Phelipanche, commonly known as broomrape, are dicotyledonous holoparasitic flowering plants that cause heavy economic losses in a wide variety of plant species. Egyptian broomrape (Phelipanche aegyptiaca Pomel.) parasitizes more than 30 food and ornamental crops, including tomato, sunflower, tobacco, chickpea and many others in different parts of the world. Crenate broomrape (Orobanche crenata Forsk.) parasitizes important legume crops, such as lentil, faba bean, chickpea, pea, vetches, and grass pea, as well as some apiaceous crops, such as carrot (4). This is the first report of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) as a new host for broomrape. This is also the first report of broomrape parasitism on a Lythraceae family member. Because of their high value for human health, the demand for pomegranate fruits has increased tremendously in the last few years and the extent of pomegranate growth has increased significantly in many regions throughout the world. In March 2013, heavy broomrape infection of a 10-year-old pomegranate orchard near the village Kfar Pines was reported. The infected area of about 2 ha was located in the middle of a big pomegranate orchard (variety 116). Broomrape inflorescence counts in the infected area revealed 14 and 0.6 P. aegyptiaca and O. crenata shoots per m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Both broomrape species were uniformly distributed over all the infected area. No differences of infection rate between the pomegranate trees could be observed. The inflorescences of the two species were normal and healthy and produced germinable seeds. Digging up the inflorescences verified a direct connection between the parasites and the pomegranate roots. The parasite species were identified morphologically according to Flora Europea (2) and Flora Palaestina (3). Detailed description of the two parasites may be found in (4). Identification was confirmed using unique DNA marker based on the photosynthetic gene rbcL of O. crenata. rbcL primers were able to distinguish between the above two species according to differences in PCR products yielding 390 bp for P. aegyptiaca and 300 bp for O. crenata (1). This was the first time that broomrapes had appeared in the orchard since its establishment, on fields that had been intensively used for processing tomato. No legume cropping history in the infected areas is known. It may be hypothesized that the broomrape seeds were dormant in the soil for over 10 years (4).The extremely wet and hot weather conditions of winter 2012/13 induced their germination. A total of 730 mm of rainfall was measured for that year as compared to the annual average of 560 mm for the region. High-level infestations with P. aegyptiaca and O. crenata were also reported from two other pomegranate orchards, Givat Ada and Evron, 11 km west and 81 km north of Kfar Pines, respectively. Neither symptoms nor visible qualitative or quantitative damage could be observed on the infected vs. non-infected pomegranate trees. However, pomegranate appears to be an alternate host for P. aegyptiaca and O. crenata serving as a seed inoculum source for nearby sensitive field crops. References: (1) R. Aly et al.

"In July 2007, a severe rot was observed on Phoenix dactylifera and P. canariensis palms in the vicinity of Heraklion (Crete), Greece. Initial symptoms were pale, elongated spots that gradually turned to dark brown streaks extending along the leaf base and rachis. In early stages, the upper parts of the leaves usually remained unaffected. Eventually decay and premature death of leaves occurred, followed by terminal bud necrosis. Shoot blights and stalk rots were also observed. A filamentous fungus was consistently isolated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) from leaf base necrotic lesions. Immersed pycnidial conidiomata on pine needles in culture were multiloculate and dark brown to black. Pycnidial paraphyses were absent. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, cylindrical, and swollen at base. Conidia were thick-walled, ovoid to ellipsoid, with rounded apex and base; initially hyaline and aseptate, 15.2 ± 0.4 × 11.7 ± 0.3 μm, later becoming dark brown and 1-septate, 21.3 ± 0.4 × 11.8 ± 0.3 μm, with a striate appearance. Total DNA was extracted and used for PCR amplification and sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region, together with parts of the flanking 18S and 28S rRNA genes (1). The sequence (GenBank Accession No. JX456475) was found 99% identical to Neodeightonia phoenicum ITS sequences (GenBank Accession Nos. EU673338 to EU673340), and was clustered together as a single group with the above sequences with good support by phylogenetic analysis that included representatives of other Neodeightonia species and several other Botryosphaeriaceae members. Based on the morphological, molecular, and phylogenetic analyses, the pathogen was identified as N. phoenicum A. J. L. Phillips &amp; Crous (2) (syn. Diplodia phoenicum (Saccardo) H. S. Fawcett &amp; Klotz), formerly also known as Macrophoma phoenicum Saccardo and Strionemadiplodia phoenicum (Saccardo) Zambettakis. To prove pathogenicity, the petioles of the older leaves of seven 2-year-old seedlings of each of three palms, P. canariensis, P. theophrasti, and Washingtonia filifera were wounded with a sterile scalpel (shallow cuts 0.5 to 1.0 cm wide, made parallel to the surface) and inoculated with agar discs from a 1-week-old PDA culture of the fungus. For controls, PDA discs without fungal mycelium were placed on the wounds of four seedlings of each host. Petiole rot, blight, and leaf necrosis were evident on all inoculated plants 6 weeks post inoculation and the pathogen was consistently reisolated from all three inoculated palm species, whereas no symptoms were observed on control plants. N. phoenicum has repeatedly and globally been reported on P. dactylifera (3). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of N. phoenicum infecting Phoenix species in Greece. Palms are extensively used as ornamental trees throughout Greece. A potential spread of palm rot caused by N. phoenicum might have a substantial economic impact and should be urgently addressed through appropriate disease management programs. References: (1) M. P.

PMID:30722326	Vakalounakis DJ, Markakis EA	Plant Dis. 97(2):287	2013	First Report of Stemphylium solani as the Causal Agent of a Leaf Spot on Greenhouse Cucumber. 	During the 2011 to 2012 crop season, a severe leaf spot disease of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) cv. Cadiz was noticed on crops in some greenhouses in the Goudouras area, Lasithi, Crete, Greece. Symptoms appeared in late winter, mainly on the leaves of the middle and upper part of the plants. Initially, small necrotic pinpoint lesions with white centers, surrounded by chlorotic halos, 1 to 3 mm in diameter, appeared on the upper leaf surfaces, and these progressively enlarged to spots that could coalesce to form nearly circular lesions up to 2 cm or more in diameter. Stemphylium-like fructifications appeared on necrotic tissue of older lesions. Severely affected leaves became chlorotic and died. No other part of the plant was affected. Small tissue pieces from the edges of lesions were surface disinfected in 0.5% NaClO for 5 min, rinsed in sterile distilled water, plated on acidified potato dextrose agar and incubated at 22 ± 0.5°C with a 12-h photoperiod. Stemphylium sp. was consistently isolated from diseased samples. Colonies showed a typical septate mycelium with the young hyphae subhyaline and gradually became greyish green to dark brown with age. Conidiophores were subhyaline to light brown, 3- to 10-septate, up to 200 μm in length, and 4 to 7 μm in width, with apical cell slightly to distinctly swollen, bearing a single spore at the apex. Conidia were muriform, mostly oblong to ovoid, but occasionally nearly globose, subhyline to variant shades of brown, mostly constricted at the median septum, 22.6 ± 6.22 (11.9 to 36.9) μm in length, and 15.1 ± 2.85 (8.3 to 22.6) μm in width, with 1 to 8 transverse and 0 to 5 longitudinal septa. DNA from a representative single-spore isolate was extracted and the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was amplified using the universal primers ITS5 and ITS4. The PCR product was sequenced and deposited in GenBank (Accession No. JX481911). On the basis of morphological characteristics (3) and a BLAST search with 100% identity to the published ITS sequence of a S. solani isolate in GenBank (EF0767501), the fungus was identified as S. solani. Pathogenicity tests were performed by spraying a conidial suspension (10<sup>5</sup> conidia ml<sup>-1</sup>) on healthy cucumber (cv. Knossos), melon (C. melo, cv. Galia), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus cv. Crimson sweet), pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo, cv. Rigas), and sponge gourd (Luffa aegyptiaca, local variety) plants, at the 5-true-leaf stage. Disease symptoms appeared on cucumber and melon only, which were similar to those observed under natural infection conditions on cucumber. S. solani was consistently reisolated from artificially infected cucumber and melon tissues, thus confirming Koch's postulates. The pathogenicity test was repeated with similar results. In 1918, a report of a Stemphylium leaf spot of cucumber in Indiana and Ohio was attributed to Stemphylium cucurbitacearum Osner (4), but that pathogen has since been reclassified as Leandria momordicae Rangel (2). That disease was later reported from Florida (1) and net spot was suggested as a common name for that disease. For the disease reported here, we suggest the name Stemphylium leaf spot. This is the first report of a disease of cucumber caused by a species of Stemphylium. References: (1) C. H. Blazquez. Plant Dis. 67:534, 1983. (2) P. Holliday.

PMID:30722335	Ligoxigakis EK, Papaioannou IA, Markakis EA, Typas MA	Plant Dis. 97(2):285	2013	First Report of Pink Rot of Phoenix and Washingtonia Species Caused by Nalanthamala vermoesenii in Greece. 	"A disease resembling pink rot was first observed on Phoenix dactylifera in Heraklion (Crete, Greece) in the summer of 2007, and was later found to be relatively common in the same district on additional species (P. canariensis, P. theophrasti, Washingtonia filifera, W. robusta). Symptoms included chlorotic and necrotic leaves (dead tips), light-brown spots (1 to 2 mm in diameter) on the leaves and rachis, rot of the rachis, sheath, and trunk, and eventual death of infected plants. A pinkish-orange layer formed both on the surface and within the infected tissues. A hyphomycete was isolated from symptomatic petioles and the pinkish-orange layer of the sheath. Sixteen isolates were examined on potato dextrose agar (PDA). All formed salmon to grayish-red colonies with sparse aerial mycelium, hyaline conidiophores with penicillate branches and terminal phialides, and ovoid, single-celled conidia in long chains. Mean conidial dimensions were 3.5 (± 0.1) × 5.5 (± 0.1) μm (n = 60 each), for 1-week-old cultures of two single-spore isolates recovered from W. filifera. A BLASTn search of GenBank with sequences of rDNA ITS (JX456472 to JX456474) revealed 100% identity of three isolates to that of Nalanthamala vermoesenii (Biourge) Schroers, comb. nov. [syn. Penicillium vermoesenii Biourge; Gliocladium vermoesenii (Biourge) Thom] originating from several palm species in Spain, the Czech Republic, Australia, and the United States (GenBank AY554212 to AY554217). Therefore, our examination of morphological and molecular characteristics suggested that the fungus recovered from symptomatic trees was N. vermoesenii (3,4). Pathogenicity tests were performed on wounds (shallow cuts 0.5 to 1.0 cm wide, made parallel to the surface with a sterile scalpel) of petioles of mature leaves of eight 2-year-old seedlings each of P. canariensis, P. theophrasti, and W. filifera. A 6-mm agar plug from a 1-week-old PDA culture was placed on the artificial wound of each inoculated plant. For non-inoculated controls, sterile PDA plugs were placed on the artificial wounds of four seedlings per host. All plants were maintained in the greenhouse at 16 ± 5°C, with 95% humidity and a 12-h photoperiod. Petiole and stem rot, leaf necrosis, and production of pinkish-orange spore masses appeared at 5 weeks post-inoculation. Average lesion length was 2.75 ± 0.15, 3.28 ± 0.21, and 6.14 ± 0.53 cm for P. canariensis, P. theophrasti, and W. filifera, respectively, suggesting that the latter is more susceptible. The fungus was consistently reisolated from all three inoculated palm species, whereas no symptoms appeared on control plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of N. vermoesenii infecting palms in Greece. The invasion of the plants by the fungus is probably favored by wounds, such as those caused by pruning or by feeding of the red palm wheevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier, which is widespread in Greece (1).

PMID:30722418	Ligoxigakis EK, Papaioannou IA, Markakis EA, Typas MA	Plant Dis. 97(9):1250	2013	First Report of Leaf Spot of Phoenix theophrasti Caused by Paraconiothyrium variabile in Greece. 	"In the spring of 2011, a severe leaf spot disease of Phoenix theophrasti was observed in the vicinity of Heraklion (Crete), Greece. Initial symptoms were small, round-ovoid spots of varying shades of brown on the leaves, later being transformed into oblong streaks (average dimensions 7.3 ± 1.0 × 3.3 ± 0.5 mm), surrounded by dark brown rings. As the disease progressed, the expanding streaks often coalesced to form enlarged necrotic lesions. Similar symptoms were also detected on petioles and leaf bases. Extended spotting and blighting occasionally resulted in leaf death. A filamentous fungus was consistently isolated onto potato dextrose agar plates from the periphery of the characteristic lesions, with cultures invariably producing brick to cinnamon colonies with sparse aerial mycelium, subglobose and dark brown superficial pycnidial conidiomata on pine needles, 1- to 3-celled hyaline conidiophores, and hyaline, subcylindrical to ellipsoidal, 1-celled, smooth- and thin-walled conidia, with average dimensions of 3.5 ± 0.6 × 1.7 ± 0.4 μm (n = 100). Total DNA of two isolates was extracted and used for PCR amplification and sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region, together with parts of the flanking 18S and 28S rRNA genes (4). Both sequences (GenBank Accession Nos. JX456476 and JX456477) were 100% identical to deposited Paraconiothyrium variabile ITS sequences (EU295640 to 48, JN983440 and 41, and JF934920), and were clustered together as a single group with these sequences with good support by phylogenetic analysis that included representatives of the relative P. brasiliense and P. africanum species. Based on the morphological, molecular, and phylogenetic analyses, the pathogen was identified as P. variabile Riccioni, Damm, Verkley &amp; Crous (2). To prove pathogenicity, 10 P. theophrasti 2-year-old seedlings were sprayed with a conidial suspension of the fungus (10<sup>7</sup> conidia ml<sup>-1</sup>, 10 ml per plant), while five additional control plants were treated with sterile distilled water. All plants were maintained in the greenhouse at 15 ± 5°C, with 90% humidity. Characteristic leaf spots were evident 4 weeks post inoculation on the older leaves, and P. variabile was consistently reisolated from all inoculated plants. No symptoms were observed on control plants. Paraconiothyrium variabile has been isolated from various woody host plants such as Prunus persica, P. salicina, and Malus sp. in South Africa (1,2), Actinidia chinensis and A. deliciosa in Italy (2), Laurus nobilis in Turkey (2), and Salix matsudana in China (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. variabile naturally infecting and causing a leaf spot disease on a palm species. Palms are extensively used as ornamentals throughout Greece and the occurrence of P. variabile can potentially result in economic loss to the local ornamental industry. References: (1) M.

PMID:30722444	Vakalounakis DJ, Doulis AG	Plant Dis. 97(9):1253	2013	First Record of White Rust, Caused by Albugo occidentalis, on Spinach in Greece. 	In early December 2012 and February 2013, severe symptoms of white rust were observed on several commercial crops of the spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) cvs. Tahiti and Rembrandt in the Aghia Pelaghia and Elia areas, respectively, of Heraklio, Crete, Greece. Initially, small, chlorotic lesions developed on the upper side of the leaves. As disease progressed, small, glassy white pustules developed on the underside of each leaf, frequently in concentric rings. The pustules were blister-like and oval, irregularly oval, or elongated, ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter and up to 3 mm in length. Lesions often coalesced, and the pustules could cover the entire lower leaf surface, rendering them unmarketable. The dome-like epidermis of host tissue covering the white rust pustules ruptured and exposed a white, chalky 'dust' of numerous powdery spores in small, circular to elongate sori. The sporangia were arranged in basipetal chains, were globose to oval, with a smooth wall that was uniformly thick and measured 19.1 ± 1.93 (14.1 to 23.5) μm × 15.3 ± 1.49 (12.9 to 20.0) μm when hydrated. Oospores were absent from the leaves. The morphological characteristics closely resembled those reported for the white rust pathogen, Albugo occidentalis Wilson (4), as well as those of A. occidentalis measured from dried leaves of Chenopodium spp. and Monolepis nuttalliana (Schult.) Greene (Herb. IMI96980, IMI351202, and IMI26345, respectively), kindly loaned by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, United Kingdom. Pathogenicity was confirmed by spraying a suspension of 10<sup>5</sup> sporangia/ml on 10 healthy 20-day-old potted spinach plants of cv. Tahiti. Inoculated plants were covered with polyethylene bags for 3 days and incubated in a growth chamber at 16 to 20°C with a 10-h photoperiod. White rust symptoms were observed on the lower surface of the leaves 10 days after inoculation. Ten control plants sprayed similarly with distilled water and maintained under the same conditions as inoculated plants showed no symptoms. The fungus present on the inoculated plants was morphologically identical to that originally observed on diseased plants, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Genomic DNA from spinach leaf sori was extracted, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), ITS1-5,8S-ITS2, as well as the cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COX2) mitochondrial gene, were amplified. PCR products were sequenced and deposited in GenBank (KC676794 and KC676795, respectively). In a BLAST search, the ITS1-5,8S-ITS2 and COX2 sequences showed 99% similarities to 684 bp (AJ553900.1) and 599 bp (AY286220.1) sequences of the corresponding A. occidentalis genes in GenBank, respectively. Based on morphological characteristics, pathogenicity tests, and molecular sequencing data, it was concluded that the pathogen on spinach in Crete is A. occidentalis. This is an economically important pathogen of spinach in the United States, that has also has been recorded in Iran (2) and India on a Chenopodium sp. (IMI351202), and in Canada on M. nuttalliana (IMI26345). To our knowledge, this is the first report of this pathogen in Greece, and the first record on spinach in Europe.

"In 2006, a disease was observed on two artichoke (Cynara scolymus L. cv. Lardati) fields in Crete, Greece, covering ~2 ha. Symptoms developed after several days of rainy and windy weather and &gt;70% of capitula were affected, resulting in unmarketable produce. Initial symptoms were water-soaked, dark green spots on bracts with many sunken, necrotic, often elongated lesions, each with a brown-black center and surrounded by a water-soaked halo with a dark red-brown margin. Symptoms were more severe on inner bracts. Isolations from symptomatic, surface-disinfected bracts onto King's B agar medium (KB) consistently yielded yellow bacterial colonies that produced a green-blue fluorescent pigment. Ten selected artichoke isolates, all gram-negative, presented the LOPAT profile (- - + - +) and were levan negative, oxidase negative, potato rot positive, arginine dihydrolase negative, and showed tobacco hypersensitive reaction. All isolates used L-arabinose, D(-)-tartrate, and L-lactate, but not sucrose, L(+)-tartrate, or trigonelline. Results were identical to those obtained with the reference strain of Pseudomonas viridiflava NCPPB 1249 (3), and strains PV3005 and PV3006 from eggplant (1). Based on these biochemical tests, 10 isolates were identified as P. viridiflava group II members of the LOPAT determinative scheme of Lelliott (1,2). Two artichoke isolates (PV608 and PV609) were selected for molecular characterization. The identity and phylogenetic analysis were determined by multilocus sequence typing with the gyrB, rpoD, and rpoB genes (PV608 Accession Nos. JN383375, JN383363, and JQ267546; PV609 Accession Nos. JN383376, JN383364, and JQ267547). BLAST searches showed highest nucleotide sequence identity (96%) with GenBank sequences of P. viridiflava reference strains NCPPB 963 and CFBP 2107. Pathogenicity of 10 artichoke isolates and reference strains was tested twice on detached capitulum bracts of artichoke cv. Lardati, as well as 4-week-old tomato plants of cv. ACE, and Chrysanthemum indicum cv. Reagan plants. Each isolate was inoculated onto 10 bracts by placing 15 μl of bacterial suspension (5 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ml) of a 48-h culture in KB broth on the surface of the bract, and pricking the bract through the drop of bacterial suspension with a sterile needle. Each isolate was also inoculated onto five tomato and five chrysanthemum plants by dipping a sterile toothpick in the appropriate bacterial culture and pricking the surface of the stem. Ten control plants were inoculated similarly with sterile, distilled water. Inoculated bracts and plants were kept in boxes lined with moist filter paper at 25 to 30°C and 80 to 100% relative humidity. Lesions developed on detached bracts within 72 h and were similar to those observed on the naturally infected plants. On tomato and chrysanthemum plants, pith necrosis and wilting symptoms were induced within 1 week of inoculation. Symptoms were not observed on control bracts and plants. Bacterial colonies were reisolated from bract lesions and stems with pith necrosis, but not from control plants, and the reisolates had the same LOPAT profile as the original isolates of P. viridiflava, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the world of P. viridiflava causing a disease of artichoke bracts. References: (1) D. E. Goumas et al. Eur. J. Plant Pathol. 104:181, 1998.

Zelkova species, trees of the elm family (Ulmaceae), are part of the Cenozoic relict flora. In western Eurasia, the genus comprises three species that are restricted to disjunct areas (Z. sicula on Sicily, Z. abelicea on Crete and Z. carpinifolia in Transcaucasia). The situation is different in East Asia, where three species (Z. serrata, Z. schneideriana and Z. sinica) have at least partly overlapping distributions. The phylogenetic and phylogeographic status of these East Asian species is still not well understood, mainly since all previous studies used almost exclusively plant material collected in botanical gardens and were based on very small numbers of individuals. Our study is the first based on 33 natural populations covering all important areas with Zelkova species in the Sino-Japanese Floristic Region. Chloroplast and microsatellite markers were used, and Bayesian analyses were run for both types of markers. East Asian Zelkova species cluster into two groups that partially overlap when comparing the two types of markers. For chloroplast markers, the two groups coincide with all Japanese, some Korean and northern Chinese Z. serrata in one group and all other individuals in the other group, regardless of whether they are attributed to Z. serrata, Z. sinica or Z. schneideriana from Korea, mainland China and Taiwan. At the nuclear level, however, the clustering clearly groups all the Z. serrata individuals together, regardless of whether they are from Japan, Korea or China, and the two other species in a second group. This complex genetic pattern in East Asian Zelkova species is most likely due to a combination of ancient diversification and speciation events and more recent hybridization during the last glacial/interglacial retractions and recolonizations. One of the surprising results of our study concerns the populations from Taiwan, which are genetically similar to Z. schneideriana. Thus, their assignation to a separate taxon (Z. tarokoensis) or to a variety of Z. serrata (Z. serrata var. tarokoensis), as currently reported in all local and national floras, might be in need of revision. Furthermore, our results indicate that the East Asian species are more closely related to Z. carpinifolia than to any other Western European species. Haplotypes of Z. sicula and Z. abelicea (Mediterranean region) as well as those of Z. sinica and Z. schneideriana (East Asia) seem to have diversified more recently. The most ancient haplotypes are found among the western Eurasian Z. carpinifolia and the East Asian Z. serrata. This result is in agreement with the carpinifolia and serrata-like morphotypes commonly found in the fossil record.

"There is growing evidence associating inflammatory markers in complex, higher order neurological functions, such as cognition and memory. We examined whether high levels of various inflammatory markers are associated with cognitive outcomes at 4 years of age in a mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece (Rhea study). We included 642 children in this cross-sectional study. Levels of several inflammatory markers (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17α, IL-10, MIP-1α, TNF-α and the ratios of IL-6 to IL-10 and TNF-α to IL-10) were determined in child serum via immunoassay. Neurodevelopment at 4 years was assessed by means of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations between the exposures and outcomes of interest after adjustment for various confounders. Our results indicate that children with high TNF-α concentrations (≥90<sup>th</sup> percentile) in serum demonstrated decreased scores in memory (adjusted β = -4.0; 95% CI: -7.7, -0.2), working memory (adjusted β = -4.0; 95% CI: -8.0, -0.1) as well as in memory span scale (adjusted β = -4.0; 95% CI: -7.9, -0.1). We also found that children with high IFN-γ serum levels showed lower scores in memory span scale (adjusted β = -3.4; 95% CI: -7.3, -0.4). Children with elevated TNF-α/IL-10 ratio demonstrated decreased quantitative (adjusted β = -4.3; 95% CI: -8.2, -0.4), motor (adjusted β = -3.5; 95% CI: -7.5, -0.5), executive function (adjusted β = -4.8; 95% CI: -8.5, -1.1), general cognitive (adjusted β = -3.6; 95% CI: -7.3, -0.1), memory (adjusted β = -3.8; 95% CI: -7.6, -0), working memory (adjusted β = -3.5; 95% CI: -7.5, -0.5) and memory span scores (adjusted β = -5.3; 95% CI: -9.1, -1.4) The findings suggest that high levels of TNF-α may contribute to reduced memory performance at preschool age."

During February 2005, 55 single-spore isolates of Botrytis cinerea were collected at the end of the season from vegetable crops grown in 18 greenhouses on the island of Crete, Greece. They were tested for sensitivity to the anilinopyrimidine fungicides pyrimethanil and cyprodinil, the hydroxyanilide fungicide fenhexamid, the phenylpyrrole fungicide fludioxonil, the dicarboximide fungicide iprodione, and the benzimidazole fungicide carbendazim. Results of the study showed the existence of benzimidazole- and dicarboximide-resistant strains at frequencies of 61.8 and 18%, respectively. Moreover, for first time, the development of resistance to anilinopyrimidine fungicides by B. cinerea was detected in greenhouse vegetable crops on the island of Crete. High resistance frequencies of 49.1 and 57.4% were observed for pyrimethanil and cyprodinil, respectively. In addition, one isolate was found to be resistant to the hydroxyanilide fungicide fenhexamid, while no strains resistant to the phenylpyrrole fungicide were detected. Among the 55 isolates tested, 13 were resistant only to carbendazim, 6 were resistant only to anilinopyrimidines, 3 were resistant to both benzimidazoles and dicarboximides, 17 were resistant to both benzimidazoles and anilinopyrimidines, 6 were resistant to both dicarboximides and anilinopyrimidines, 1 was simultaneously resistant to benzimidazoles, dicarboximides, and anilinopyrimidines, 1 was resistant to both anilinopyrimidines and hydroxyanilides, and 8 were sensitive to all fungicides tested. A strong cross-resistance relationship was found between the two anilinopyrimidine fungicides tested when log transformed EC<sub>50</sub> values of the isolates were subjected to a linear regression analysis (r = 0.71). Despite the detection of several phenotypes with simultaneous resistance to chemically unrelated active ingredients, in none of the remaining possible fungicide pairs was there observed any kind of cross-resistance relationship.

"A fungus was isolated consistently from dead shoot tips and flag leaves of Arundo donax L. (Poaceae) in France, Crete, Cyprus, Italy, Morocco, and Spain from April of 2003 through September of 2005. The fungus was identified as Nigrospora oryzae (Berk. &amp; Br.) Petch (teleomorph Khuskia oryzae) on the basis of morphological characteristics (1). The mean diameter of 80 conidia obtained from sporulating plant specimens collected in France, Crete, and Cyprus were 14, 15, and 15 μm, respectively. The mean diameters of 25 conidiogenous cells and conidiophores were 7 and 4 μm, respectively. Identification was confirmed by comparing the sequence of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 1 and 4 regions from the French isolate (GenBank Accession No. DQ219433) with the sequence of a voucher specimen from the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France. The isolate of N. oryzae from France was deposited at the CBS collection in Utrecht, the Netherlands (CBS 113884). N. oryzae is known to be a weak pathogen on a wide range of plants but has not been reported on A. donax, which is now a well-established weed in the United States and North America, probably originating from the Mediterranean Region. Herein, the possible use of N. oryzae as a biological control agent was investigated. Twenty young A. donax shoots growing in the greenhouse and 20 emerging canes in the field were selected on the basis of uniformity in size. A spore suspension in distilled water adjusted to 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> conidia/ml of the French isolate was prepared and 0.5 ml was injected with a syringe just below the growing point of the flag leaf in onehalf of the greenhouse and field plants. The remaining plants were injected with 0.5 ml of distilled water as controls. Infection and death of the flag leaf occurred in 30% of the shoots in the greenhouse and 50% of the canes in the field 21 days from inoculation. No disease developed on the control plants. Greenhouse inoculation tests were repeated once. N. oryzae was reisolated from dead leaves and the terminal node of inoculated shoots, satisfying Koch's postulate. Attempts made to induce disease symptoms by applying spore suspensions on the whorl of leaves surrounding the apical tip failed. This is an indication that an insect vector may be needed to carry and deposit N. oryzae spores into the tight, whorled flag leaf for infection and disease development to occur. To our knowledge, this is the first report of foliar and cane rot of A. donax caused by N. oryzae. References: (1) K. H. Domsch et al. Page 515 in: Compendium of Soil Fungi.

"The typical hallmark of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) disorders is increased implantation site intermediate trophoblast (ISIT) cell numbers. However, the extent of trophoblast proliferation and apoptosis have not been found to differ from those of normal placentation. MicroRNA-125a (miR-125a) induces apoptosis in colon cancer cell by targeting myeloid cell leukemia-1 gene (<i>MCL1</i>). We aimed to investigate the influence of miR-125a on ISIT cells in PAS disorders in 15 patients (self-paired trials) with placenta previa and PAS disorders. Expression of miR-125a and <i>MCL1</i> were measured in villous trophoblasts and basal plate myometrial fibers from creta site and adjacent noncreta tissues by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and expression of the MCL1 protein was assayed by Western blotting. Flow-cytometry was used to examine the effect of miR-125a overexpression on apoptosis in vitro in HTR-8/SVneo cells, and luciferase activity assays was used to confirm miR-125a targeting of <i>MCL1</i>. In vivo, the expression levels of miR-125a was significantly lower in creta versus noncreta tissues, and the expression of <i>MCL1</i> was upregulated; moreover, immunohistochemistry showed that the increased ISIT cells in the creta were positive for MCL1 protein. <i>MCL1</i> was downregulated in the miR-125a-overexpressing HTR-8/SVneo cells in vitro, and overexpression of miR-125a-induced apoptosis in the HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast line. Finally, luciferase activity assays confirmed that miR-125a directly target the 3' untranslated region of <i>MCL1</i> in the 293T cell line. In conclusion, downregulation of <i>MCL1</i>-targeting miR-125a exerts an antiapoptotic effect on ISIT cells in PAS disorders."

"The distribution of plant species around the Mediterranean basin is a product of the influence of both geographical barriers and of climatic changes experienced during the Tertiary, with the transition from a warm to cool periods. Several species, once largely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, retracted to refugial areas in southern Europe where they are described as Tertiary relicts. <i>Platanus orientalis</i> is a typical representative of Tertiary flora in southwest Eurasia; its distribution spreads from the Caucasus to the Mediterranean, with its western border in Southern Italy and Sicily. We analysed genetic diversity and differentiation in the centre and western part of its distribution range using nuclear microsatellites and compared genetic parameters between core and western populations. We found an overall decrease in genetic diversity estimates (heterozygosity, private allelic richness) from central towards western populations, with those from Southern Italy and Sicily showing the lowest values. The low level of genetic diversity probably results from historic range fragmentation experienced by <i>P. orientalis</i> in its westernmost distribution as confirmed by high level genetic isolation of these populations. Ornamental hybrids were genetically distinguished from <i>P. orientalis</i> as contained private alleles, indicating that gene flow with natural populations is rare. Population assignment and neighbour-joining (NJ) analysis of populations identified four groups belonging to two main phyletic groups (the Southern Italian-Sicilian-Balkan and Cretan-Bulgarian-Turkish lineages) that seem to have different biogeographic origin and also excluded an artificial origin for southern Italian and Sicilian populations as previously suggested. These results show that quantifying the genetic variation of a Tertiary relict in a geographical context, and the potential effect of hybridization with introduced ornamental hybrids, can provide useful insights on factors influencing population genetic structure. Such information is crucial to predict how such taxa will respond to increasing anthropogenic influence on the environment. "

To assess regional differences in the weight status and abdominal obesity among 13-year-old Greek adolescents. Cross-sectional, nationwide study in Greece. A representative sample of 4833 13-year-old adolescents (50.7% boys) was recruited throughout the nine regional districts of Greece from 2010 to 2012. Basic anthropometry measurements (weight, height, and waist circumference) were obtained. Abdominal obesity and weight status were assessed according to the International Obesity Task Force criteria. The majority of the sample had a healthy body weight (60.3%), 4.1% were underweight, 27.2% were overweight, and 8.5% were obese. For boys, the highest prevalence of underweight was recorded in Epirus, normal body weight on the Ionian Islands, overweight in Central Greece and Macedonia, and obesity on the Ionian Islands. Among girls, the highest underweight prevalence was on the Ionian Islands, normal body weight in Macedonia, overweight in Central Greece and Macedonia, and obesity in Crete. Abdominal obesity affected 12.9% of the sample, with the greatest prevalence among Cretan boys and Thracian girls. Additionally, residing on the Greek islands was associated with a higher prevalence of central adiposity. Greek 13-year-old adolescents who are subjected to geographical changes exhibit high obesity and abdominal obesity rates. This study provides evidence to design regionally tailored interventions that aim to tackle and prevent the disease among the nine regional districts in Greece.
PMID:30818625	Dimou D, Drossopoulou J, Moschos E, Varveri C, Bem F	Plant Dis. 86(3):329	2002	First Report of Citrus tristeza virus in Greece. 	Large-scale surveys of Citrus spp. for the presence of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) by the Ministry of Agriculture in Greece began in 1995. Over 26,000 trees have been tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoprinting (2). In summer 2000, the first CTV-infected sweet orange cv. Lane Late tree grafted on CTV-tolerant Carrizo citrange was found in Argolis County, Peloponnese. This tree belonged to a batch of CAC propagation material (20 trees) illegally introduced from Spain in 1994, which was subsequently traced and found to be infected (45%). A follow-up search of trees grafted with the above material was undertaken in the two concerned regions (Argolis and Chania-Crete), and more than 3,500 trees have been removed. Extensive surveys continue to identify and destroy new infections. Few cases (15 of 16,800) of natural transmission to cultivars other than cv. Lane Late have been found. All of these have been close to the initially infected trees in the Argolis area. Surveys in spring 2001 were extended to certified propagation material of Clemenpons mandarin on Carrizo citrange imported from Spain, and 7 of 1,038 plants were infected (0.64%). The virus was successfully graft-transmitted to sweet orange cv. Madame Vinous and sweet lime seedlings, where it was identified by immunoprinting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (1). Mild vein clearing symptoms appeared on both indicators. Vein clearing on sweet lime was also accompanied by leaf cupping. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CTV in Greece. References: (1) A. Sambade et al. J. Virol. Methods 87:25, 2000. (2) C.

Root and stem rot of cucumber (Cucumis sativus), caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-cucumerinum, is a new catastrophic disease of greenhouse crops in Greece and some other countries. No effective disease control methods are available, apart from soil disinfestation by fumigation with methyl bromide and disinfection of internal space of greenhouses with a formaldehyde solution. However, it is anticipated that the use of methyl bromide will be phased out in Greece by 1 January 2005. Therefore, alternative measures for disease management are urgently required. In this study, the efficacy of grafting commercial Dutch type cucumber hybrids onto various cucurbits, used as rootstocks, was examined in growth chamber and greenhouse experiments. Of the nine commercial Cucurbita spp. evaluated, six, A27, Cucurbita Ficifolia, Patron F<sub>1</sub> 42.91 F<sub>1</sub>, TS-1358 F<sub>1</sub>, and TZ-148 F<sub>1</sub>, found resistant to F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-cucumerinum, were selected to serve in subsequent greenhouse experiments as root-stocks for grafting the susceptible cv. Brunex F<sub>1</sub>. Of these, Peto 42.91 F<sub>1</sub>, TS-1358 F<sub>1</sub>, and TZ-148 F<sub>1</sub> were found to be superior to the others due to their horticultural performance under the climatic conditions prevailing in Crete during the cucumber crop season, late October to late May. This study shows that grafting commercial Dutch type cucumber hybrids onto various resistant Cucurbita rootstocks could be used as an alternative control method to methyl bromide for root and stem rot.

In late summer 2000, tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) grown in greenhouses in Ierapetra, Tympaki, and Chania (Crete) showed leaf curling, reduced leaf size, yellowing, shortened internodes, and a bushy appearance. More than 30 ha of tomato greenhouses were affected and the disease incidence ranged from 15 to 60% with estimated crop losses of over $500,000. Similar symptoms were observed in tomato samples from Marathon (Attiki) and Southern Peloponnese. All greenhouses with infected plants were infested with high populations of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), which were also observed outside the greenhouses on several weeds. Tomato symptoms were similar to those caused by Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV). The assumed virus could not be transmitted mechanically but successful transmission was obtained by grafting onto healthy tomato plants. Over 100 samples of symptomatic tomato plants collected from Crete and southern Peloponnese gave positive reactions when tested by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies to TYLCV-European (Adgen Ltd). The serological results were confirmed by PCR using two pairs of primers, universal degenerate (1) and MA 13 and MA 17 (2), amplifying different parts of the virus genome. The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis (AluI, HaeIII, and TaqI) of the 541 bp amplicon obtained with the degenerate primers showed patterns similar to TYLCV-Is (Israeli species). The second pair of primers gave the expected 348 bp product, which was sequenced. Sequence comparisons revealed 99% identity with TYLCV-Is (EMBL no. X15656, X76319). The resulting sequence was at least 97.7% identical to sequences of TYLCV isolates from the Dominician Republic (EMBL no. AF024715), Cuba (EMBL no. AJ223505), Portugal (EMBL no. AF105975), Iran (EMBL no. AJ13271), and Spain (EMBL no. AF071228). The disease appeared for the first time in 1992 in Tymbaki, but was limited to very few plants in one glasshouse. However, the cause was not determined. To our knowledge, this is the first report of TYLCV of the Begomovirus genus in Greece. References: (1) D. Deng et al. Ann. Appl. Biol. 125:327, 1994. (2) J.

A module for Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite stereo-pair imagery processing and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) extraction is presented. A large file size of VHR satellite imagery is handled using the parallel processing of cascading image tiles. The Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm detects potentially tentative feature matches, and the resulting feature pairs are filtered using a variable distance threshold RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Finally, point cloud ground coordinates for DEM generation are extracted from the homologous pairs. The criteria of average point spacing irregularity is introduced to assess the effective resolution of the produced DEMs. The module is tested with a 0.5 m × 0.5 m Geoeye-1 stereo pair over the island of Crete, Greece. Sensitivity analysis determines the optimum module parameterization. The resulting 1.5-m DEM has superior detail over reference DEMs, and results in a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of about 1 m compared to ground truth measurements.

"A leaf spot of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa (A. Chev.) C. F. Liang &amp; A. R. Ferg.) leaves was recently observed on plants of the cultivar Hayward in an orchard near Salerno, in southern Italy. The affected plants showed early severe defoliation. The fungus isolated from the infected leaves was identified as Alternaria alternata (Fr.:Fr.) Keissl., based on conidial morphological characteristics. Pathogenicity tests were made by inoculating detached leaves of male pollinator cultivar Tomuri and the female cultivars Hayward and Bruno with a 7-mm disk taken from actively growing cultures of the fungus on potato dextrose agar (PDA). After 14 days, necrotic leaf spots developed and A. alternata was consistently isolated from the inoculated leaves. A. alternata has been observed as a pathogen on leaves and fruits in New Zealand. In the Mediterranean, it has been reported in Israel (2) and in the island of Crete (1). This is the first report of Alternaria leaf spot on kiwifruit in Italy. References: (1) V. A. Bourbos and M.

Sex estimation methods based on skeletal remains vary on the selection of skeletal element, data acquisition and statistical approach resulting in variable classification accuracies that are highly dependent on the sample population. The only exception of this rule seems to be the os coxa, that appears to differ consistently between males and females across the globe. Currently sex estimation based on the os coxa can be easily estimated by taking ten measurements, inputting these in the DPS2 software and getting a sex estimate and the probability of correct group assessment. The performance of the software is highly reliable as confirmed by a validation study by Brůžek et al. (2017). Yet, there are still many populations not represented in the reference sample used to develop the software. The current study aimed to validate DPS2 using a sample from Crete, Greece. A total of 133 os coxae were measured following instructions on DSP2. Data were used to estimate sex with the software and to create population specific formulae for Greeks. DSP2 classified 117/133 (85.7%) of the sample with over 95% posterior probability (PP) of correct classification. Of the individuals classified with over 95% PP, only 3 were misclassified (2.6%).The best population specific formula only improved this percentage by 2.1% which indicates that DSP2 is a reliable tool for sex estimation in the Greek sample and it is recommended as method of choice in sex estimation of remains of unknown ancestry. If Greek ancestry is confirmed, population-specific formulae can be used in conjunction with DSP2 for a more reliable sex estimation.

Canine pathogens transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods are of significant importance for veterinary and, in some cases, human health. However, they are still underestimated and rarely investigated in many parts of the Mediterranean region, mostly due to financial reasons. Therefore, in the present paper, we investigated the occurrence of blood-associated pathogens affecting dogs in Crete, Greece. For this purpose, blood samples from 103 shelter dogs were screened for the pathogens by PCR and serological tests. Overall, samples from 43 dogs scored positive for at least one pathogen (41.8%). In particular, antibodies to Leishmania infantum were detected in 26 dogs (25.2%), and 15 and 11 animals were positive for Hepatozoon canis (14.6%) and Mycoplasma haemocanis (10.7%) by PCR, respectively. Co-infections were recorded in nine animals. Clinical signs indicative of infection (alterations of skin or coat or reduced body condition) were detected in 10 animals, four of which were infected with one pathogen, three with two pathogens. Based on the results obtained, dogs from Crete appear to be frequently exposed to several blood-borne pathogens, including agents of zoonotic concern. Given that some of the pathogens were reported for the first time in this area, results presented in our study should improve the awareness of the local veterinarians and of dog rescue organisations in order to reduce disease burden on stray and owned dogs and to control the spread of canine vector-borne diseases from Greece to non-endemic areas by travelling or exported infected dogs.
PMID:30884883	Spence JD	Nutrients. 11(3)	2019	Nutrition and Risk of Stroke. 	"Nutrition is far more important in stroke risk than most physcians suppose. Healthy lifestyle choices reduce the risk of stroke by ~80%, and of the factors that increase the risk of stroke, the worst is diet: only ~0.1% of Americans consume a healthy diet, and only 8.3% consume a somewhat healthy diet. The situation is probably not much better in most other countries. A Cretan Mediterranean diet, high in olive oil, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes, and low in cholesterol and saturated fat, can reduce stroke by 40% or more in high-risk patients. The role of the intestinal microbiome in cardiovascular risk is emerging; high levels of toxic metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria from meat (particularly red meat) and egg yolk are renally excreted. Patients with renal impairment, including the elderly, should limit red meat and avoid egg yolk, as should other patients at high risk of stroke. Salt intake should be limited to 2⁻3 grams per day. Metabolic B12 deficiency is common and usually missed. It has serious neurological consequences, including an increase in the risk of stroke. It now clear that B vitamins to lower homocysteine reduce the risk of stroke, but we should probably be using methylcobalamin instead of cyanocobalamin."

High quality observational data with a firm uncertainty assessment are essential for the proper validation of biogeochemical models for trace metals such as iron. Typically, concentrations of these metals are very low in oceanic waters (nM and sub nM) and ICP-MS is therefore a favoured technique for quantitative analysis. Uncertainties in the measurement step are generally well constrained, even at sub-nM concentrations. However, the measurement step is only part of the overall procedure. For the determination of trace metal solubilities from aerosols in the surface ocean, aerosol collection on a filter paper followed by a leaching procedure is likely to make a significant contribution to the overall uncertainty. This paper quantifies the uncertainties for key trace metals (cobalt, iron, lead and vanadium), together with aluminium as a reference element, for a controlled, flow through laboratory leaching procedure using filters collected from three different sampling sites (Tudor Hill (Bermuda), Heraklion (Crete) and Tel-Shikmona (Israel)) and water, glucuronic acid and desferrioxamine B as leachants. Relative expanded uncertainties were in the range of 12-29% for cobalt, 12-62% for iron, 13-45% for lead and 5-11% for vanadium. Fractional solubilities for iron ranged from 0.2 ± 0.1% to 16.9 ± 3.5%.

"An innovative multi-criteria methodology was proposed for the prioritization of the Program of Measures (PoM) in the Water Region of Crete, and applied specifically to the basin of Geropotamos river according to the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. This study relied on the four pillars of sustainability and the EU cross-compliance legislative objective for the minimization of the climate change impact. The multi-criteria evaluation methodology was based on the results of four different types of analyses: a DPSIR analysis, a SWOT analysis, a Cost-Benefit Analysis and a climate change impacts analysis. Public participation on the results of the study with local stakeholders was used at every stage of the multi-criteria evaluation process, from the selection and weighing of the criteria to the final ranking and measures' prioritization. The PoM contains two types of measures: basic measures which deal with the implementation of existing legislation and are the same for all regions of Greece and additional measures which are specified for the Region of Crete. The results of the prioritization process in Geropotamos Basin suggests that improving the water quality and ecological status of available water resources do not always require significant financial resources and can have a high impact in terms of achieving ""good"" quality status.

This paper presents a continuation of the evaluation of utilizing Nano Carbon Tubes (CNTs) in reinforced concrete (CNT-CRETE). The compressive, tensile and bond strengths of the samples with and without CNTs were investigated. Scanning Electron Microscope (SME) was utilized to study the microstructure of the prepared samples. In addition, the corrosion resistance of CNT-CRETE, was measured and compared to traditional concrete. Four mixes were prepared, with 0.01%, 0.02%, and 0.03%, CNTs by weight of cement, along with a control mix without CNTs. The results of the experimental work showed that adding CNTs led to an increase in the compressive, tensile and bond strengths of specimens compared to those of the control specimen. SEM examination for control and CNTs specimens showed that CNTs specimen were well structured compared with the control specimen and this affirms that CNTs act as bridges across micro cracks, which explains the improvement in mechanical properties. The diameter of steel bars played a significant role in failure mechanism for pull-out testing and corrosion resistance. In general, adding CNTs to the concrete mix increased the rate of corrosion for steel bars within the low risk limits. Benefits from using CNTs were limited to moderate. Mineral/chemical admixtures or fibers provide better improvements in the mechanical properties of concrete without the problems associated with dispersing CNTs and the health hazard of handling a Nano material.

"The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increases among elderly people and is associated with a high risk of dementia. Identifying factors that may contribute to the progress of MCI to dementia is critical. The objective of this study was to examine the association of objective sleep with cognitive performance in MCI patients. A subsample of 271 participants with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD; N = 50) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N = 121) and 100 persons who were not cognitively impaired (NI) were recruited from a large population-based cohort in the island of Crete, Greece (3140 older adults aged &gt;60 years). All participants underwent extensive neuropsychiatric/neuropsychological evaluation and a 3-day 24-hr actigraphy. Objective sleep variables and their association with neuropsychological performance were examined across the three groups, controlling for demographics, body mass index, depression, sleep apnea symptoms and psychotropic medications. Patients with AD had significantly longer 24-hr total sleep time (TST) compared to the MCI and NI groups. Long 24-hr TST was associated with reduced performance on tasks that placed significant demands on attention and processing speed in the MCI group and the AD group. Elderly patients with MCI have similar objective sleep duration to normal controls, whereas AD patients sleep longer. Long sleep duration in patients with multidomain subtypes of MCI is associated with critical non-memory cognitive domains. It appears that within the MCI group those that sleep longer have more severe cognitive impairment."

Variability in long-distance migration strategies is still poorly understood due to the fact that individuals are often tracked from a single colony/population. Transoceanic migrations of Scopoli's shearwaters (<i>Calonectris diomedea</i>) across the Strait of Gibraltar (SoG) have been tracked from several breeding colonies isolatedly, and factors related to the variability in phenological schedules among different populations remain, therefore, not well-understood. Using light-level geolocator data, I examined the autumn (postbreeding) and spring (prebreeding) migratory passage dates through SoG of four populations of Scopoli's shearwater spread along the longitudinal breeding range of the species. Additionally, I also estimated the at-sea activity patterns (from immersion data) during both migratory passages, as well as the body size (from morphometric data) of the individuals of these populations. On average, Scopoli's shearwaters leave the Mediterranean (cross SoG) on 31 October ± 1.8 days on their autumn migrations and return on 03 March ± 1.6 days on their spring migrations. At the population level, there was a clear gradient in the timing of crossing SoG: birds from the westernmost populations (Murcia, SE Spain) were the first ones in leaving the Mediterranean while easternmost breeders (Paximada, Crete) were the last ones. In spring, only birds from the largest breeding population (Zembra, Tunisia) seemed to advance their return and crossed SoG significantly earlier than birds tracked at the remaining populations. In both passages, shearwaters from central and eastern populations spent more time flying than their conspecifics from the western Mediterranean. Scopoli's shearwater populations display a differential phenology and behavior in their migratory passages through SoG. The longitudinal gradient in body size already reported for the species could be an evolutionary response to an obvious trade-off between sharing common wintering grounds in the Atlantic Ocean and the temporal constraints of restoring physiological condition in those grounds.

"Early diagnosis of tuberculosis infection can significantly contribute to the control of the disease. The aim of the present study was to describe the tuberculin skin test (TST) trends over a 24-year period (1990-2013) and explore the value of universal tuberculosis screening in a low-burden area. All first graders that underwent TST during the 24-year study period (1990-2013) on the island of Crete, Greece, were retrospectively included in the study. A total of 82 402 children (92.3% of Greek nationality; 51.0% male) underwent TST, of whom 335 (0.41%, 95% CI 0.37-0.46) were found to have positive TST while 0.27% of the study population had a TST between 5 and 9 mm. The tuberculin index declined significantly between 1990-1994 and 2010-2013 (0.67 vs 0.26; RR 2.73, 95% CI 1.82-4.09; p &lt; 0.0001). Positive TST result was significantly higher in the immigrant than the native group (0.66% vs 0.24%; RR 3.76 95%, CI 2.89-4.84; p &lt; 0.0001). In the last study years, 386 children (488 native; 153 immigrant) should be tested for one to be found TST positive. Our findings question the massive tuberculin testing in low-burden areas and point to selective screening of high-risk groups."

"Adherent and invasive placenta, termed Placenta Creta Spectrum (PCS), is associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality. Incidence and risk factors for Placenta Creta are on the rise and call to optimize the obstetric care for this condition. We sought to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes between a ProActive Peripartum Multidisciplinary Approach (PAMA) as compared to the urgent management of the Placenta Creta Spectrum patients. We conducted a single-center prospective observational study between 2005-2016. PCS patients registered with the implementation of a PAMA protocol 2014-2016 epoch(E2) were compared with the pre-PAMA 2005-2013 epoch(E1), managed by urgent team recruitment. The PAMA protocol is grounded on a continuum of care; A. Antenatal: PCS risk assessment based on clinical history and imaging, surgical, anesthesia, urological consults and designation of a dedicated team to be present at planned surgery; B. Delivery: planned at 34-35 weeks, massive transfusion protocol activation, insertion of ureteral catheters, vertical uterine incision, placement of vessel loops on the iliac vessels, avoidance of active placenta delivery, followed by the decision of hysterectomy or uterine repair; C. Post-operative care: intensive care admission. We evaluated maternal and neonatal outcomes. During the study period 158,438 deliveries were registered in our institution; we identified a total of 72 PCS cases (0.05%): 50(69.4%) in E1 and 22 (30.6%) in E2. Patient characteristics were comparable among epochs. Significantly, patients in E2 vs. E1 had fewer events of massive blood transfusion 36.0% vs. 13.6%, p = 0.05; were transfused less RBC units: median 4 vs. 1.5, p = 0.012, had no transfusion-related respiratory complications and hemorrhage control re-laparotomies. Hysterectomy and hollow visceral injury rates were comparable (72% vs. 63.7%, 26% vs. 22%; respectively). The hysterectomy pathology assessment was available for the majority of the cases in both epochs; percreta diagnosis rate significantly increased in E2. The neonatal outcome was similar among the epochs. Institution of a PAMA protocol for PCS resulted in eliminating the urgent deliveries and in reducing the associated significant hemorrhagic related maternal morbidity, with no increase in the rate of hysterectomy or adverse neonatal outcome."

This work provides the ethnobotanical data concerning the traditional use of medicinal plants in Macedonia region (Northern Greece), which has, up to now, been poorly investigated. The aim of the present study was to collect, analyze, and evaluate information on the use of medicinal plants among different population groups living in Central Macedonia. The study was carried out in the area of two small cities, Edessa and Naoussa, and nearby villages. The ethnobotanical data were gathered through extensive and semistructured interviews. The informants belonged to different population groups living in the study areas and were involved, at least partially, in agriculture. Together with detailed reports on each species, data were also summarized by some indices, such as Fidelity Level (FL) and Informant Consensus Factor (F<sub>ic</sub>). A group of 96 informants was interviewed and 87 plant taxa with medicinal uses were cited. Medicinal plants are used to treat a wide range of diseases, in particular ailments of the respiratory tract and skin disorders. The importance of the traditional use of plants to cure and prevent common and some uncommon diseases had been highlighted. About 55% of medicinal plants mentioned by the informants had been previously reported to be sold in Thessaloniki herbal market as traditional remedies. Medicinal uses of some endemic taxa had been reported, e.g., <i>Satureja montana</i> subsp. <i>macedonica,</i> a member of the <i>S. montana</i> group restricted to Northern Central Greece, <i>Origanum dictamnus</i>, an endemic species of Crete, and six Balkan endemics, i.e., <i>Achillea holosericea, Digitalis lanata, Helleborus odorus</i> subsp<i>. cyclophyllus, Sideritis scardica, Thymus sibthorpii,</i> and <i>Verbascum longifolium.</i> Several differences in Traditional Ethnobotanical Knowledge (TEK) were observed in relation to social and cultural components of the population. Only 7 species (<i>Crataegus monogyna</i>, <i>Hypericum perforatum</i>, <i>Matricaria chamomilla</i>, <i>Rosa canina</i>, <i>Sambucus nigra</i>, <i>Sideritis scardica,</i> and <i>Tilia platyphyllos</i>) were commonly reported by all population groups, whereas 30 out of 87 taxa (34%) were exclusively mentioned by a single group. All groups are incorporated in the local society and do not identify themselves as members of different ethnic groups, although they try to preserve their distinctiveness by keeping their traditions and dialects. Nevertheless, our data show that the knowledge regarding the medicinal plant use was rarely accompanied by preservation of linguistic diversity concerning the plant names. This work contributes to improve the knowledge on the traditional use of plants in the folk medicine of a region like Central Macedonia where different population groups live together, partially maintaining their traditions. A part of data of this paper has been presented as posted at 112° Congress of Italian Botanical Society (IPSC), Parma 20-23 September 2017.

Based on the predictions of General Circulation Models, significant reduction of precipitation in Mediterranean areas is a possible scenario. Hence, better understanding of the spatial and temporal precipitation patterns is necessary in order to quantify desertification risks and design suitable mitigation measures. This study uses monthly precipitation measurements from a sparse network of 54 monitoring stations on the Mediterranean island of Crete (Greece). The study period extends from 1948 to 2012. The data reveal strong correlations between the western and eastern parts of the island. However, the average annual precipitation in the West is about 450 mm higher than that in the East. We construct a spatial model of average annual precipitation in Crete. The model involves a topographic trend and residuals with anisotropic spatial correlations which are fitted with a recently developed variogram function. We use regression kriging to generate annual precipitation maps and to identify locations of high estimation uncertainty. To our knowledge, this is the most detailed spatial analysis of precipitation in Crete to date. We present the analysis in detail for the year 1971. The trend accounts for ≈ 74% of the total variance. The highest precipitation estimate is 2331 mm in the West and 1781 mm in the East. The highest relative estimation uncertainty (≈ 20%) is observed along the southeastern coastline of the island, where the lowest values of annual precipitation are observed. This region includes one of the major agricultural areas of the island. The same overall patterns are found for other years in the study. Finally, we find no statistical evidence for a decrease in the global (over the entire island) annual precipitation during the study period.

This review updates the information upon the chemical composition of propolis from all Mediterranean countries as well as their biological properties and applications. The non-volatile fraction of propolis was characterized by the presence of phenolic acids and their esters and flavonoids. Nevertheless, in some countries, diterpenes were also present: Sicily (Italy), Croatia, Malta, Creta (Greece), Turkey, Cyprus, Egypt, Libya, Algeria and Morocco. The volatile fraction of propolis was characterized by the presence of benzoic acid and its esters, mono- and sesquiterpenes, being the oxygenated sesquiterpene β-eudesmol characteristic of poplar propolis, whereas the hydrocarbon monoterpene α-pinene has been related with the presence of conifers. Regardless the chemical composition, there are common biological properties attributed to propolis. Owing to these attributes, propolis has been target of study for applications in diverse areas, such as food, medicine and livestock.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common infection of the genital tract affecting millions of women worldwide. Data on epidemiological trends of VVC in Greece are scarce. This study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of VVC among symptomatic women in Crete, Greece, identify the Candida species involved and determine their susceptibility to antifungals. Over a 6-year period (2012-2017), 10 256 symptomatic women with vaginitis were evaluated. Isolation of yeasts was performed on Sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol, and the isolates were identified using the API 20 C AUX and/or the Vitek 2 YST card. Susceptibility of the isolates to amphotericin, fluconazole, voriconazole and flucytosine was determined by the Vitek 2 automated system. The results were interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards criteria. Vaginal swab cultures of 1217 (11.9%) women yielded Candida species. Recurrent VVC was documented in 62 (5.1%) of them. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species (75.6%), followed by Candida glabrata (13.6%). Overall, resistance rates to amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole and flucytosine were 0.2%, 6.6%, 1.4% and 2.1%, respectively. Fluconazole resistance of C. albicans significantly increased in the second period of the study (2015-2017) (P = 0.031). This study demonstrated that VVC is a common infection among women in our region, with C. albicans being the predominant species involved. Although resistance to antifungals was infrequent, resistance to fluconazole among C. albicans isolates was found to significantly increase with time. Continued surveillance of changes in species distribution and susceptibility to antifungals are necessary to guide treatment.

The current study observes the input/output energy quantities and its associated financial value, in vegetable greenhouses on Crete, Greece, for the 2015-2016 cropping seasons. The utilized data was taken in regular direct basis for the implementation of energy input-output analysis and data envelopment analysis. For input data analysis, four crop practices were used tomato, pepper, cucumber, and eggplant. The outcomes of the expended majority of energy input-output analysis showed that fertilizers count for 53%, fossil fuel counts for 16%, and electricity counts for 12%. The mean crop and energy consumption for each crop practice were estimated as 94,036 MJ/ha and 171,950 kg/ha, 115,473 MJ/ha and 173,000 kg/ha, 81,196 MJ/ha and 128,893 kg/ha, and 146,067 MJ/ha and 209,501 kg/ha, respectively. Inputs with the biggest shares in total inputs were manpower counts for 30%, fertilizers count for 22%, and crop protection counts for 16%. DEA method showed that the mean values of technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency, and scale efficiency were 0.90193, 0.97272, and 0.80322, respectively. The mean scale efficiencies were set as 0.80. The findings of this research would be valuable to the inefficient producers undertaking into consideration the recommendations made by this method, where the overall input in Euro could be meaningfully condensed without any reduction on the current overall output.

The medieval history of several populations often suffers from scarcity of contemporary records resulting in contradictory and sometimes biased interpretations by historians. This is the situation with the population of the island of Crete, which remained relatively undisturbed until the Middle Ages when multiple wars, invasions, and occupations by foreigners took place. Historians have considered the effects of the occupation of Crete by the Arabs (in the 9th and 10th centuries C.E.) and the Venetians (in the 13th to the 17th centuries C.E.) to the local population. To obtain insights on such effects from a genetic perspective, we studied representative samples from 17 Cretan districts using the Illumina 1 million or 2.5 million arrays and compared the Cretans to the populations of origin of the medieval conquerors and settlers. Highlights of our findings include (1) small genetic contributions from the Arab occupation to the extant Cretan population, (2) low genetic contribution of the Venetians to the extant Cretan population, and (3) evidence of a genetic relationship among the Cretans and Central, Northern, and Eastern Europeans, which could be explained by the settlement in the island of northern origin tribes during the medieval period. Our results show how the interaction between genetics and the historical record can help shed light on the historical record.

"	The recycling of waste tires is of paramount importance for environmental protection and for economic reasons. The number of scrapped tires in the United States has reached 550 million per year and is still rising. Even higher numbers are estimated in the European Union, reaching 1 billion tires per year. Disused tires create waste with a highly negative environmental impact. Tire disposal mainly involves highly polluting treatments (e.g. combustion processes to produce fuel oil), with only a small percentage of waste (3% to 15%) destined for less-invasive treatments such as powdering. In this article we will look at previous studies in which different amounts of waste tire powder are combined with cement concrete mixtures to provide a final product with mechanical properties suitable for engineering applications. Previous work has shown that a good compressive strength can be achieved through replacing 30% of powdered tire with crushed sand. First, as the percentage of aggregation between crumb rubber and crushed sand increases, compressive strength decreases. Second, aggregation replacement of crumb rubber and crushed sand shows a reduction in density at around 10%. Third, the modulus of elasticity depends on the percentages added: the more rubber added to concrete, the less elastic the product will be. In addition, a less tough concrete means higher strength. However, adding rubber to concrete increases the toughness.<sup>1</sup>.

Several important habitats have become threatened in the last few centuries in the Mediterranean Basin due to major changes adopted in land-use practices. The consequent loss of natural and seminatural orchid habitats leads to the appreciation of small anthropogenic habitats, such as cemeteries and roadside verges. Colonization of cemeteries and roadside verges by orchids has long been known, but no study to date compared the suitability of these two anthropogenic habitats for orchids. Therefore, in this paper our aim was to survey cemeteries and roadside verges and to compare these two habitats regarding their role in conserving Mediterranean terrestrial orchids. We conducted field surveys in three Mediterranean islands, Cyprus, Crete, and Lesbos, where both cemeteries and roadside verges were sampled on a geographically representative scale. We found a total of almost 7,000 orchid individuals, belonging to 77 species in the two anthropogenic habitat types. Roadside verges hosted significantly more individuals than cemeteries in Crete and Lesbos, and significantly more species across all three islands. Our results suggest that although cemeteries have a great potential conservation value in other parts of the world, intensive maintenance practices that characterized cemeteries in these three islands renders them unable to sustain valuable plant communities. On the other hand, roadside verges play a prominent role in the conservation of Mediterranean orchids in Cyprus and Greece. The pioneer status of roadside verges facilitates their fast colonization, while roads serve as ecological corridors in fragmented landscapes.

The origin of the tin used for the production of bronze in the Eurasian Bronze Age is still one of the mysteries in prehistoric archaeology. In the past, numerous studies were carried out on archaeological bronze and tin objects with the aim of determining the sources of tin, but all failed to find suitable fingerprints. In this paper we investigate a set of 27 tin ingots from well-known sites in the eastern Mediterranean Sea (Mochlos, Uluburun, Hishuley Carmel, Kfar Samir south, Haifa) that had been the subject of previous archaeological and archaeometallurgical research. By using a combined approach of tin and lead isotopes together with trace elements it is possible to narrow down the potential sources of tin for the first time. The strongly radiogenic composition of lead in the tin ingots from Israel allows the calculation of a geological model age of the parental tin ores of 291 ± 17 Ma. This theoretical formation age excludes Anatolian, central Asian and Egyptian tin deposits as tin sources since they formed either much earlier or later. On the other hand, European tin deposits of the Variscan orogeny agree well with this time span so that an origin from European deposits is suggested. With the help of the tin isotope composition and the trace elements of the objects it is further possible to exclude many tin resources from the European continent and, considering the current state of knowledge and the available data, to conclude that Cornish tin mines are the most likely suppliers for the 13th-12th centuries tin ingots from Israel. Even though a different provenance seems to be suggested for the tin from Mochlos and Uluburun by the actual data, these findings are of great importance for the archaeological interpretation of the trade routes and the circulation of tin during the Late Bronze Age. They demonstrate that the trade networks between the eastern Mediterranean and some place in the east that are assumed for the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE (as indicated by textual evidence from Kültepe/Kaneš and Mari) did not exist in the same way towards the last quarter of the millennium.

This study used CT scans from 64 Cretan adults (32 male and 32 female) to produce three-dimensional models of each individual's cranium and skin surface. Using the models, the soft tissue depths were measured at 36 craniofacial landmarks; the means and standard deviations were calculated for the general Cretan population, and for male and female Cretans separately. Cretan facial soft tissue depths were then compared to those of French, Slovak, and Korean adults. 16 of the 36 landmarks exhibited sex differences among Cretans, with males having consistently thicker depths than females. The facial soft tissue depths of Cretan adults also presented significant differences when compared to other populations. Overall, the average soft tissue depths obtained represent the first database for the craniofacial approximation of Cretan (Greek) adults."

"It is commonly accepted that frailty and dementia-related cognitive decline are strongly associated. However, degree of this association is often debated, especially in homebound elders with disabilities. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association of frailty on cognitive function in older adults receiving homecare. A screening for frailty and cognitive function was conducted at 12 primary healthcare settings of the nationally funded program ""Help at Home"" in Heraklion Crete, Greece. Cognitive function and frailty were assessed using the <i>Montreal Cognitive Assessment</i> questionnaire and the <i>SHARE-f index</i>, respectively. <i>Barthel</i>-Activities of Daily Living and the <i>Charlson Comorbidity Index</i> were also used for the identification of disability and comorbidity, respectively. The mean age of the 192 participants (66% female) was 78.04 ± 8.01 years old. In depth-analysis using multiple linear regression, revealed that frailty was not significantly associated with cognitive decline (frail vs. non-frail (B'=-2.39, p=0.246) even after adjusting for depression and multi-comorbidity. Importantly, as protective factors for cognitive decline progression and thus dementia development, was scientifically correlated with annual individual income &gt;4500 (B'=2.31, p=0.005) -poverty threshold-compared to those with &lt;4500 and, higher education level as compared to Uneducated (B'=2.94, p=0.019). However, depression was associated with cognitive decline regardless of socioeconomic variables. In conclusion, our results suggest that health professionals caring for frail people with cognitive impairment, must focus on early recognition and management of depression."

Cases of meningitis C dropped significantly after the conjugate meningitis C vaccine was licensed for routine vaccination in Greece in 2000 (IR of 1.5 vs 0.3, P &lt; 0.028) while the Streptococcus pneumoniae cases showed a threefold decrease after the PCV13 vaccine was licensed in Greece in 2009 (IR 2.7 vs 1.0, P &lt; 0.03). Vaccination had already eliminated Hib in Greece in the 1990s. Bacterial meningitis cases decreased in children following the introduction of the meningitis C and PCV13 vaccines in Greece. Hib had already disappeared and significant reductions in meningitis C and Streptococcus pneumoniae were observed."

A male patient in his mid-60s presented with a severe pneumonia following return to the UK after travel to Crete. He was diagnosed with Legionnaire's disease (caused by an uncommon serogroup of <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>). He was pancytopenic on admission, and during a long stay on critical care he was diagnosed with a disseminated <i>Aspergillus</i> infection. Bone marrow aspiration revealed an underlying hairy cell leukaemia that undoubtedly contributed to his acute presentation and subsequent invasive fungal infection.

We present in this paper a structural health monitoring study of the Egyptian lighthouse of Rethymnon in Crete, Greece. Using structural vibration data collected on a limited number of sensors during a 3-month period, we illustrate the potential of the stretching method for monitoring variations in the natural frequencies of the structure. The stretching method compares two signals, the current that refers to the actual state of the structure, with the reference one that characterizes the structure at a reference healthy condition. For the structure under study, an 8-day time interval is used for the reference quantity while the current quantity is computed using a time window of 24 h. Our results indicate that frequency shifts of 1% can be detected with high accuracy allowing for early damage assessment. We also provide a simple numerical model that is calibrated to match the natural frequencies estimated using the stretching method. The model is used to produce possible damage scenarios that correspond to 1% shift in the first natural frequencies. Although simple in nature, this model seems to deliver a realistic response of the structure. This is shown by comparing the response at the top of the structure to the actual measurement during a small earthquake. This is a preliminary study indicating the potential of the stretching method for structural health monitoring of historical monuments. The results are very promising. Further analysis is necessary requiring the deployment of the instrumentation (possibly with additional instruments) for a longer period of time.

"The aim of this study is to know the relevance of initial imaging, Karnofsky performance status,age,location and cord edema for future score development for radiologists. The present study was carried out on total of 32 patients who visited SRN Hospital and Kriti scanning centre between August 2009 to February 2019. General and systemic examination was done. Finally KPS score was given to each patient in accordance with their clinical status. Magnetic resonance imaging was contemplated using scanner - Magnetom SP Vision; Siemens -Supercon 1.0 Tesla system. The morphologic characterization and specific assessment of various tumors and tumor like masses of spine in view of MR imaging features and their relationship with clinical features have been analyzed with Chi square test which reveal: Age versus location - <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> = 4.32; df = 4; <i>P</i> &gt; 0.36 (NS), age versus cord edema - <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> = 4.27; df = 3; <i>P</i> &gt; 0.23 (NS), and location versus cord edema - <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> = 2.67; df = 2; <i>P</i> &gt; 0.26 (NS). Chi Square test shows there is no any statistically significant association between age and location; age and spinal cord edema, and location and spinal cord edema. Correlation between clinical aggressiveness (change in follow-up KPS) and MR imaging features could not be assessed in our study because majority of patients could not be evaluated after one month because of loss of follow-up. Poor KPS itself lead to movement during MRI and movement related artifacts affecting initial imaging,which was managed by cotton padded neck strap. KPS depends only on general condition one of the factor for outcome so for future score development age,location and cord edema together may be useful."

Intrigued by testimonies of Saxon borreliosis self-help groups concerning considerabl improvements of their symptoms by ingestion of Cistus creticus L. (Cistaceae) leaf preparations, we recently reported on the growth inhibiting activity of extracts with different polarities and its volatile oil against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss) in vitro, determined by a bioassay guided procedure. The most active volatile oil (only about 0.10% in leaves) was found to be dominated by labdane-type manoyloxides as well as carvacrol, determined via GC-MS. These terpenes are major active constituents of the old pharmaceutical oleoresin labdanum, which is secreted from the leaf surface of C. creticus and traditionally harvested, e.g., on Crete by brushing the shrubs. In order to elucidate the definite anti-Borrelia active principles of C. creticus, preparative scale separation of the diethyl‑ether soluble fraction of Cretan labdanum was achieved by combined silica gel 60-and RP-18 CC and analysed by novel TLC-Extractor/ES-MS as well as by 1d/2d-1H/13C-NMR data. For the antispirochaetal activity tests against Bbss in vitro, all samples were solubilised in water with addition of polysorbate 80, the effect of which on bacterial growth was examined and found to be negligible. This led to isolation and identification of the monoterpene carvacrol as well as of the four major manoyloxides manoyloxide (A), 3-acetoxy-manoyloxide (B), 3‑hydroxy-manoyloxide (C), and epi‑manoyloxide (D). Additionally, 2-keto-manoyloxide (E) and sclareol (F) were identified via GC/EI-MS. In subsequent microbiological tests of the isolated compounds, epi‑manoyloxide (D) exhibited by far the strongest individual antispirochaetal effect, equal to the positive control amoxicilline. Furthermore, manoyloxide (A), carvacrol, and the diethyl‑ether soluble fraction of labdanum as a whole contribute to the strong antispirochaetal activity, while the other labdanes were less active. Isolated manoyloxides were further used as external standards for a GC-MS screening of labdanum samples from different origins, revealing exceptionally high contents of all analysed manoyloxides in the samples of Cretan labdanum from C. creticus, while their contents in other commercial available labdanum samples were lower by several orders of magnitude. Especially in Spanish labdanum samples, declared as Cistus ladanifer L., mainly simple alkanes and at most traces of epi‑manoyloxide (D) and of manoyloxide (A) could be detected. The application of C. creticus preparations by Lyme disease self-help groups may be considered as a reasonable therapy approach. For the first time, isolated epi‑manoyloxide and carvacrol could be evaluated as most promising candidates for drug development and labdanum based phytomedicine development, respectively. They should serve as vital active markers for quality assessments of C. creticus preparations.

"Melissa officinalis L., commonly known as lemon balm, is one of the most well known edible and medicinal plants of the Lamiaceae family. It is quoted in almost all known medical treatises, from Antiquity up to modern era, such as Corpus Hippocraticum, Dioscorides' De Materia Medica and later on in medieval medical manuscripts and Pharmacopoeias. Actually, it is widely used as herbal medicine for the relief of mild symptoms of mental stress, to aid sleep and for symptomatic treatment of mild gastrointestinal complaints including bloating and flatulence. In Greece, the empirical physicians ""vikoyiatroi"" recommended the decoction of dry flowers and leaves to treat tracheobronchitis, hysteria, epilepsy, heart arrhythmias, as hypnotic and against skin disorders. The present study was conducted to investigate the potential beneficial effects in psoriasis in mice of M. officinalis ssp. altissima and to carry out the chemical analysis in order to reveal its main bioactive secondary metabolites. Non polar and polar extracts of M. officinalis ssp. altissima aerial parts were prepared by using dichloromethane and methanol, successively; in addition a decoction was made upon oral information by local users in Crete, where the plant was collected. All three preparations were chemically analyzed in order to isolate their main constituents. Chemical structures of all isolated compounds were determined by 1D, 2D-NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Furthermore, the antioxidant potential of extracts and decoction was evaluated through DPPH radical scavenging capability. The in vivo in mice anti-psoriatic efficacy of all preparations was estimated through clinical and histopathological assessment and measurements of TEWL and hydration. The dichloromethane extract yielded ursolic acid, 2α-hydroxy-ursolic acid, pomolic acid, 3β-stearyloxy-urs-12-ene, oleanolic acid, noropacursane and campesterol; the methanol extract afforded rosmarinic acid and methyl rosmarinate, while from the decoction caffeic acid, 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)lactic acid and rosmarinic acid were isolated. The psoriasis evaluation, based on PASI score, photodocumentation and histopathological estimation showed that the decoction primarily and the dichloromethane extract secondly could significantly contribute to psoriasis treatment. The decoction seems able to reestablish skin physiology by decreasing dryness and enhancing skin barrier function. Moreover, the decoction showed the best antioxidant activity, while the dichloromethane extract the weakest. The triterpene derivatives of the dichloromethane extract are likely to be responsible for its anti-psoriatic activity. The abundant polyphenolic load of the decoction contributes to its high antioxidant activity and the most effective results against psoriasis. The anti-psoriatic activity of the decoction confirmed the traditional use of this plant as antioxidant, wound healing and skin barrier repair agent."

"Leptin is critical for central nervous system development and maturation. This study aimed to evaluate the potential regulatory role of cord leptin in the neuropsychomotor development of children ages 18 months to 6 years. This study included 424 children from a prospective mother-child cohort (Rhea Study; Crete, Greece) with available cord leptin levels and data on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition), 4 years (McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities), and 6 years (Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices and Trail Making Test). Multivariable linear regression models were used to explore the associations. Each 10-ng/mL increase in the cord leptin level was associated with increased scores on the gross motor scale at 18 months (β coefficient: 3.8; 95% CI: 0.0-7.5), with decreased scores in the general cognitive performance (β coefficient: -3.0; 95% CI: -5.5 to -0.4), perceptual performance (β coefficient: -3.4; 95% CI: -6.0 to -9.9), working memory (β coefficient: -3.1; 95% CI: -5.7 to -0.4), executive function (β coefficient -3.1; 95% CI: -5.7 to -0.5), and functions of the posterior cortex (β coefficient: -2.7; 95% CI: -5.2 to -0.1) scales at 4 years, and with a 3.7-unit decrease in the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices score at 6 years (β coefficient: -3.7; 95% CI: -6.9 to -0.5). Increased cord leptin levels are associated with enhanced gross motor development at 18 months but decreased cognitive performance in early and middle childhood."

Short-term extreme increases in desert-derived particulate-matter with aerodynamic diameter below 10 μm (PM<sub>10</sub>) may affect emergency department (ED) visits due to COPD exacerbations. Our aim was to identify the effect of extreme increases in desert-derived PM<sub>10</sub> on ED visits for dyspnea and COPD exacerbations and on the related hospital admissions. We performed a retrospective analysis of dyspnea-related ED visits and hospital admissions in Heraklion, Crete, during four consecutive storms of desert-derived PM<sub>10</sub> that happened during March 2018. We collected data from over 17,000 ED visits and recorded patients with atopic symptoms, COPD exacerbations, and dyspnea, as well as admissions to the departments of pulmonary medicine, internal medicine, and cardiology. PM<sub>10</sub> data were collected from a monitoring station in the same geographic area. Four desert dust storms were recorded during the study period with 238, 203, 1138, and 310 μg/m<sup>3</sup> average-daily PM<sub>10</sub> and 652, 308, 4262, and 778 μg/m<sup>3</sup> hourly mean day-peak PM<sub>10,</sub> respectively. There was no clinically important increase in total ED visits, total admissions or admissions to the departments of cardiology, pulmonary medicine, or internal medicine, during PM<sub>10</sub> peaks. However, during the desert dust storm with daily-average PM<sub>10</sub> above 500 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, there was a striking increase in dyspnea-related ED visits (including COPD exacerbations, 3.6-fold increase), while there was no clinically important increase in non-asthma allergy-related ED visits. Extreme desert dust storm episodes may cause meaningful increases in ED visits for dyspnea and COPD exacerbations/admissions.

"Nursing homes are considered as reservoirs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The present study investigated the point prevalence and molecular epidemiology of S. aureus colonization among nursing home residents. The study population comprised of 227 residents, living in four nursing homes of the Heraklion, Crete, Greece area, between January and December 2015. From each nursing home, swabs from the anterior nares of all eligible participants were obtained within a 2-week period. The isolated S. aureus strains were identified and screened by standard microbiological and molecular epidemiological methods. S. aureus carriage was found in 62 out of 227 participants (38.4%) with 33 out of 62 (53.2%) being MRSA. The median age was 83 years (range 52-103). Females were more frequently colonized [47 (75.8%)]. All 33 methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates were mecA-positive carrying SCCmec type IV, 30 (91%) the fnbA, and 17 (51.5%) the PVL genes. Thirty-two (97%) belonged to a single pulsotype C; among them, the PVL-positives belonged to ST80 clone, whereas, the PVL-negatives to ST225. Among the 33 MRSA isolates, 32 (97%) were clindamycin-resistant, carrying the ermA gene. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains showed polyclonality and 76% were PVL-positive. In conclusion the present study has shown that nursing homes in our area can be regarded as important reservoirs for community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA)."

Post-partum depression (PPD) is a severe psychiatric disorder affecting ∼15% of young mothers. Early life stressful conditions in periconceptual, fetal and early infant periods or exposure to maternal psychiatric disorders, have been linked to adverse childhood outcomes interfering with physiological, cognitive and emotional development. The molecular mechanisms of PPD are not yet fully understood. Unraveling the molecular underpinnings of PPD will allow timely detection and establishment of effective therapeutic approaches. To investigate the underlying molecular correlates of PPD in peripheral material, we compared the serum metabolomes of an in detail characterized group of mothers suffering from PPD and a control group of mothers, all from Heraklion, Crete in Greece. Serum samples were analyzed by a mass spectrometry platform for targeted metabolomics, based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM), which measures the levels of up to 300 metabolites. In the PPD group, we observed increased levels of glutathione-disulfide, adenylosuccinate, and ATP, which associate with oxidative stress, nucleotide biosynthesis and energy production pathways. We also followed up the metabolomic findings in a validation cohort of PPD mothers and controls. To the very best of our knowledge, this is the first metabolomic serum analysis in PPD. Our data show that molecular changes related to PPD are detectable in peripheral material, thus paving the way for additional studies in order to shed light on the molecular correlates of PPD.

"This study investigates the clinic-, provider- and patient-level factors associated with delivery of 4 (Ask, Advise, Assist, Arrange) elements of the 5As approach to smoking cessation in general practice in Greece. We conducted a secondary analysis of data derived from a quasi-experimental study (The TiTAN Crete study) among general practitioners (GPs) in Crete, Greece in 2015-2016. Twenty-four GPs and a cross-sectional sample of 1301 smokers from their practices were surveyed. This paper reports on the results of the multi-level modelling conducted to examine predictors of 4As delivery. Our analysis found clinic characteristics, including the presence of an electronic medical record, being located in a rural setting, and being in private practice were significantly associated with increased rates of tobacco treatment delivery. Female GPs were more likely than males to arrange follow-up (AOR 3.38, 95%CI 1.11, 10.35). Our analysis found a variety of patient-level factors were positively associated with tobacco treatment delivery, including: longer smoking history; presence of a smoking related illness; readiness to quit smoking; and symptoms or a diagnosis of anxiety, depression or other mental health illness. Other patient-level factors were negatively associated with tobacco treatment delivery, including level of education and reason for visit. Patients seen in clinic for episodic care were less likely to be 'asked' (AOR 0.22, 95%CI 0.12, 0.39), 'advised' (AOR 0.22, 95%CI 0.13, 0.38), and receive 'assistance' (AOR 0.36, 95%CI 0.19, 0.66) compared to patients seen in clinic for a medical examination. Providers are significantly more frequently delivering tobacco treatment to a sub-group of high-risk patients compared to other tobacco users in their clinical practice. This results in missed opportunities for early intervention and disease prevention."

Observational epidemiological studies provide valuable information regarding naturally occurring protective factors observed in populations with very low prevalences of vascular disease. Between 1935 and 1965, the Italian-American inhabitants of Roseto (Pennsylvania, USA) observed a traditional Italian diet and maintained half the mortality rates from myocardial infarction compared with neighboring cities. In the Seven Countries Study, during 40years (1960-2000) Crete maintained the lowest overall mortality rates and coronary heart disease fatalities, which was attributed to strict adherence to the Mediterranean diet. In the French Three-City Study, a ten-year follow-up (2000-2010) showed that higher consumption of olive oil was associated with lower risk of death, as well as protection from cognitive decline and stroke. A large number of population-based studies and intervention trials have demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower prevalence of vascular disease, obesity, arthritis, cancer, and age-associated cognitive decline. Many of these effects are the result of consumption of fruits, seeds, legumes and vegetables but olive oil is the chief dietary fat in Mediterranean countries and the main source of monounsaturated fatty acids, as well as an important source of beneficial polyphenols and other antioxidants. Considering the critical role of vascular factors in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer disease it seems appropriate to focus on disease modification through proven dietary therapy. The authors base their hypothesis on meta-analyses of epidemiological data, numerous experimental studies, and a comprehensive review of the mechanisms of action of extra-virgin olive oil and its components in the prevention of vascular disease. In addition, extra-virgin olive oil has had positive effects on experimental animal models of Alzheimer disease. We therefore propose that extra-virgin olive oil is a promising tool for mitigating the effects of adverse vascular factors and may be utilized for potential prevention of late-onset Alzheimer disease.

Existing literature regarding social communication outcomes of interventions in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) depends upon human raters, with limited generalizability to real world settings. Technological innovation, particularly virtual reality (VR) and collaborative virtual environments (CVE), could offer a replicable, low cost measurement platform when endowed with intelligent agent technology and peer-based interactions. We developed and piloted a novel collaborative virtual environment and intelligent agent (CRETA) for the assessment of social communication and collaboration within system and peer interactions. The system classified user statements with moderate to high accuracies. We found moderate to high agreement in displayed communication and collaboration skills between human-human and human-agent interactions. CRETA offers a promising avenue for future development of autonomous measurement systems for ASD research.

Spandidos, Professor Emeritus of Clinical Virology at the University of Crete School of Medicine in Crete, Greece, is a pioneer in world research in Virology, Oncology and medical education. He has been the first Professor of Clinical Virology at the University of Crete School of Medicine, the only School of Medicine with a separate Department of Clinical Virology in Greece. According to Professor Spandidos, the understanding of the interactions of viruses with human host cells is what enables the development of new vaccines and new therapies against a wide range of diseases in humans, including cancer. Over the past two decades, the expansion of new knowledge, treatments, prevention and management options and the emerging needs on neonatal and paediatric viral infections have made the role of future paediatric virologists more than necessary. For this reason, he strongly believes that Paediatric Virology should be recognized as a new paediatric subspecialty. Professor Spandidos declares that medical education is a continuous sequence from undergraduate to postgraduate/specialty/subspecialty medical training and continuing learning. He also supports the concept that the future of medical education represents the future of Medicine.

On October 10th, 2015, he presented the Paediatric Virology subspecialty's proposal, which up-to-date has attracted the critical interest of several international experts in the scientific fields of Neonatology, Paediatrics, PID and Virology and has been evaluated as a unique project of innovation in medical education. According to Dr Mammas, Paediatrics is the specialty, which daily provides the opportunity to support with responsibility the children's smile, the hope of life and future. He highlights the significant role of the Paediatric Virology Study Group (PVSG), a paediatric think tank, which was established by a group of paediatric trainees and young paediatricians in 2007 and since then has been involved with enthusiasm in the perspectives of Paediatric Virology in medical education. Dr Mammas strongly believes that in the future, Paediatric Virology subspecialists will have a strategically principal role, both clinical and academic, at the fight against viral infections in childhood. This aim will be supported by the newly founded Institute of Paediatric Virology (IPV), the first scientific initiative in the world committed to medical education on neonatal and paediatric viral infections.

"To compare the long-term outcomes of corneal cross-linking (CXL) for the treatment of keratoconus using two different techniques for epithelial removal: transepithelial phototherapeutic keratectomy (t-PTK) and mechanical epithelial debridement. In this prospective, comparative, interventional case series, 26 patients (30 eyes) with progressive keratoconus underwent CXL treatment. Fifteen eyes (13 patients) underwent epithelial removal with t-PTK (Cretan protocol) and 15 eyes (13 patients) underwent mechanical epithelial debridement (Dresden protocol) during CXL. Visual, refractive, and keratometric outcomes were evaluated preoperatively and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years postoperatively. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed in any of the patients. In the Cretan protocol group, mean uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) visual acuity improved from 0.99 ± 0.42 and 0.33 ± 0.28 logMAR preoperatively to 0.75 ± 0.32 (P = .018) and 0.21 ± 0.16 (P = .024) logMAR at 4 years postoperatively, respectively. In the Dresden protocol group, mean UDVA improved from 0.83 ± 0.47 logMAR preoperatively to 0.63 ± 0.40 logMAR (P = .033) at 4 years postoperatively, whereas mean CDVA did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement postoperatively (P &gt; .05). In the Cretan protocol group, mean corneal astigmatism improved from -6.19 ± 4.54 diopters (D) preoperatively to -4.68 ± 3.10 D (P = .041) at last follow-up, whereas in the Dresden protocol group there was no statistically significant difference postoperatively (P &gt; .05). Epithelial removal with t-PTK during CXL (Cretan protocol) resulted in better visual, refractive, and keratometric outcomes compared with mechanical epithelial debridement over a long-term follow-up.

Electromagnetic radiation influences in many ways humans and animals, while earthquakes are known to be related with electromagnetic phenomena. We recently showed that large earthquakes reduced admissions of psychiatric patients, whereas small earthquakes were associated with increased number of admissions. Our aim was to examine the effect of seismic-related electromagnetic activity on two chronic and severe psychiatric disorders varying in terms of etiology and treatment, i.e. bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Retrospective data concerning monthly admission rates of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in the Psychiatric Unit of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece between 2008 and 2010 were analyzed in relation to the number of earthquakes with small (≥2) or larger magnitude in the Crete region in Greece. Results showed a marked reduction of acute admissions during a storm of large earthquakes, which was greater in patients with bipolar disorder (91.2%) than schizophrenia patients (52.4%). In addition there was a significant increase of admissions during a period of frequent small earthquakes, primarily among patients with bipolar disorder. The results suggest that electrostatic fields that accompany large earthquakes may have a protective effect on psychiatric disorders, particularly on bipolar disorder. These findings are consistent with the ameliorating effect of electromagnetic fields used in Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in patients with bipolar disorder. Future studies focusing on the underlying mechanisms may lead to more specific treatments of psychiatric disorders.

Among the traded plants, 16 face extinction risk and/or are under protection status. Prices vary largely for the same taxon and form of sale. Lamiaceae is the family with the highest number of e-traded taxa, <i>Tulipa bakeri</i> is the most traded species, and the living plant is the commonest form of sale. Thirty-seven endemic taxa are advertised in the websites of travel agencies involved in wildlife tourism. <i>Tulipa doerfleri</i> is the most frequently encountered taxon in these websites, whereas Lamiaceae, Liliaceae and Orchidaceae are similarly represented. The additional search showed a very rapid increase in the e-trade of the Cretan endemis. The two examined markets are similar in that geophytes play a prominent role and Lamiaceae rank first among the represented plant families, but differ in several aspects: only 22.6% of the taxa detected are common in both, obedience to rules exhibited by travel agencies is not usually the case with nurseries, and potential threats to wild populations are estimated as considerably higher for the traded plants. Sixteen endemic taxa of Crete were identified as requiring special attention."

"The existence of reliable prognostic indices is of paramount importance in the management of cirrhosis. Both the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and the older Child-Pugh (CP) scores are widely used. The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, initially used in hepatocellular carcinoma, has not been thoroughly investigated in cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic accuracy of ALBI, MELD, MELD with sodium (MELD-Na), CP, and the corrected for creatinine CP scores in a genetically homogeneous Cretan cirrhotic population. One hundred ninety-five outpatients or hospitalized cirrhotics (127 male, median age 66 years) were studied over a period of 2 years and ALBI, platelet-albumin-bilirubin, MELD, MELD-Na, CP score, and 2 types of modified CP score (CP-I and CP-II) with serum creatinine were calculated and correlated with survival. ALBI had an optimum balance between sensitivity and specificity (area under the curve 0.704, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.630-0.778) compared to the other scores. In the multivariate analysis, the only factors independently associated with death were the ALBI score (hazard ratio [HR] 2.51, 95%CI 1.69-3.73; P&lt;0.001), the MELD-Na score (HR 1.04, 95%CI 1.00-1.09; P=0.045), and age (HR 1.05, 95%CI 1.03-1.07; P&lt;0.001). When only decompensated cirrhosis was evaluated, the multivariate analysis showed that the ALBI score (HR 3.03; 95%CI 1.92-4.78; P&lt;0.001), and age (HR 1.05, 95%CI 1.03-1.07; P&lt;0.001) were independently associated with death. ALBI score might be a better prognostic indicator of mortality in cirrhosis and given its simplicity could substitute for the CP, MELD, and MELD-Na scores."

"Following the description of Cacochroa rosetella Corley, 2018 it soon became clear that there was considerable confusion regarding the identity of Cacochroa permixtella (Herrich-Schäffer, 1854). In this paper the genus Cacochroa is revised and this confusion is resolved, a neotype is chosen for C. permixtella and nearly all records verified. Male and female genitalia of C. permixtella are remarkably different from those of the remaining species, which are here placed in Rosetea Corley Ferreira, gen. nov. The distributions of the three species previously described in Cacochroa are clarified. Cacochroa permixtella has a distribution limited to Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. Rosetea corfuella (Lvovsky, 2000), comb. nov., is recorded for the first time from Crete, Croatia, Macedonia, Turkey and Israel; the male of R. rosetella (Corley, 2018), comb. nov., is described for the first time and the species is recorded for the first time from Spain, France (mainland and Corsica), Italy (mainland and Sardinia), Greece (mainland and Crete), Croatia and Algeria. Rosetea sara sp. nov. is described from North Africa (Morocco and Tunisia). Male and female genitalia and DNA barcode data are presented for all four species."

"Limnephilus minos Malicky 1970 is a micro-endemic caddisfly restricted to the Greek island of Crete. Mesophylax impunctatus aduncus (Navás 1923) is known from Turkey and the southern Balkan peninsula; Greek records range from islands close to the mainland and Skiros to the northern mainland, and Attica. This paper describes the previously unknown larvae of both taxa. Information on the morphology of the 5th larval instar of each taxon is given, and the most important diagnostic characters are illustrated. A discriminatory matrix for the Greek limnephilid larvae with multifilament gills is also provided. In the context of existing identification keys, the larva of L. minos belongs to the group of Limnephilini larvae where face setae are lacking on the mid- and/or hind femora; the species keys together with L. auricula Curtis 1834 and can be separated from the latter species by setae present between the primary setae on the distal section of mid- and hind trochanters. In contrast, face setae are present on the mid- and/or hind femora in M. impunctatus aduncus. Its larva can be easily identified by the fact that 3 or more ventral-edge setae are present on the midfemur, by setae present on both sides of the anal slit, and by its grazer-type mandible lacking terminal teeth."

Exploring species richness and turnover patterns and their drivers can provide new insights into underlying mechanisms shaping community assembly, with significant implications for biodiversity conservation. Here, we explored diversity patterns of non-endemic, neo-endemic and palaeo-endemic vascular plants in Crete, Greece, a Mediterranean hotspot of plant richness and endemism. We evaluated the relationship between α-diversity and environmental (bioclimatic variables, topography), and anthropogenic variables by Generalized Additive Models, after accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Then, we quantified turnover using the novel concept of zeta diversity (the number of shared species by multiple sites), a framework which allows to explore the full spectrum of compositional turnover, the contribution of rare and widespread species to observed patterns and the underlying processes shaping them. Finally, we explored the abiotic and biotic effects, i.e. how well one category of species (non-endemics, palaeo-endemics, neo-endemics) predicts the patterns of the other categories, on zeta diversity by multi-site Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling. We found a strong correlation between neo-endemic and palaeo-endemic α-diversity, with climate, topography, and human impact driving species richness. Zeta diversity analysis revealed a sharper decrease of shared palaeo-endemic species, followed by neo-endemics, and then by non-endemics with the number of sites considered to estimate compositional turnover. Perhaps, the narrow distributions of palaeo-endemics as relict species and often habitat specialists, thus persisting locally, and of neo-endemics that may have not reached yet their potential geographical range, resulted in the observed zeta diversity decline pattern. Deterministic processes controlled species turnover of rare non-endemic and neo-endemic species, while deterministic and stochastic processes contributed similarly to palaeo-endemic turnover. However, stochasticity dominates in the case of widespread species in all occasions. The environmental and anthropogenic variables were poor predictors of compositional turnover, especially of widespread species. However, the non-endemic species composition was correlated to rare palaeo-endemics and neo-endemics, highlighting the importance of biotic effects in driving turnover patterns. It seems that centers of neo-endemism of vascular plants coincide with centers of palaeo-endemism in Crete, but species richness and species turnover are shaped by different drivers.

The Kastellorizo island group (in the Dodecanese, Greece) is situated in the southeast corner of the Aegean Archipelago. It consists of twenty islets, of which the three largest (Kastellorizo, Ro and Strongyli) and seven smaller ones belong to Greece. Knowledge of the malacofauna on the islands is relatively poor. Only eight species were known prior to the present study, all from the islet of Kastellorizo. Here, using the scientific collections at the Natural History Museum of Crete collected mainly by the authors and also by several researchers since 1976, we reappraise the malacofauna of the island group. Thirty-one species were found in total (23 from Kastellorizo, 19 from Ro, 15 from Strongyli, 10 from Agios Georgios, 14 from Agrielia, 6 from Psomi and 10 from Psoradia). The fact that there are no endemic snail species in the islands can be accounted for by their proximity to the Turkish coast, their common paleogeography with Turkey until the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, and the influence of humans. All but two species, <i>Mastus etuberculatus</i> and <i>Vitrea riedeliana</i>, are known from the adjacent Turkish coasts. Together with the subfossil species found on the smaller islets, the predominance of different species on each islet suggests a continuous substitution from the source areas of Turkey and the Aegean.

Understanding antimicrobial prescribing attitudes and perceptions, especially in the early stages of medical training, is an important driver for appropriate interventions. This study examined junior doctors' knowledge, attitudes and perceptions regarding antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in Greece. A self-administered, internet-based questionnaire survey was completed by trainees and residents of all primary care centres and hospitals in Crete, Greece. From the 313 invited junior doctors, 214 (68.4%) fully completed the questionnaire. The mean correct knowledge score (four items) was 60%. The highest confidence rates with prescribing were recorded in accurately diagnosing an infection that needs antimicrobial treatment, selecting an appropriate administration route, and selecting the appropriate dosage. The lowest confidence rates were recorded in modifying antimicrobial treatment based on clinical and/or microbiological evidence, prescribing antimicrobial combinations and not prescribing an antimicrobial in a febrile patient without severity criteria and uncertain diagnosis of infection. Use of guidelines and expert consultation were perceived as the most important factors influencing antimicrobial prescribing practices. Most participants were aware of the antimicrobial resistance problem in Greece, and considered excessive prescribing of antimicrobials and broad-spectrum antimicrobials to be the most important causes. Availability of local and national guidelines and antimicrobial resistance data, senior consultation and infectious diseases specialist consultation were the preferred interventions to improve antimicrobial prescribing. The findings of this study will contribute to the design of appropriate interventions, based on local evidence, for the establishment of antimicrobial stewardship programs in a country characterised by excessive use of antimicrobials and high resistance rates.

"The 1st International Conference on Oral Mucosal Immunity and the Microbiome (OMIM) took place at the Avra Imperial Hotel, Chania, Crete, Greece, between 26th and 30th September 2018, under the auspices of the Aegean Conferences. This was the first Aegean Conference of its kind in thematic oral research, and a unique blend of immunological and microbiological perspectives, which attracted leading scientists from around the world to discuss the latest advances in the field. The Conference was divided into eight sessions that spanned across 4 days and included the following topics: (a) mucosal barrier immunity; (b) host response and inflammation; (c) microbiome in homeostasis and dysbiosis; (d) fungal and viral pathogenesis; (e) oral microbiome and proteome; (f) microbial virulence and biofilms; (g) microbiome, cancer, and systemic disease; and (h) microbiota and inflammation. There was substantial thematic overlap among all sessions, which promoted constant involvement of the participating scientists. An important hallmark was the active debate between oral microbiologists and oral immunologists, who explored new ideas and potential research collaborations, a crucial aspect for bridging our understanding of oral diseases in the context of the whole body. Key findings are highlighted and thematically presented in the following sections."

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an evidence-based, low-cost, non-medical treatment approach for patients with chronic respiratory diseases. This study aimed to start and assess the feasibility, acceptability and impact of a PR programme on health and quality of life of respiratory patients, for the first time in primary care in Crete, Greece and, particularly, in a low-resource rural setting. This was an implementation study with before-after outcome evaluation and qualitative interviews with patients and stakeholders. In a rural primary healthcare centre, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or asthma were recruited. The implementation strategy included adaptation of a PR programme previously developed in United Kingdom and Uganda and training of clinical staff in programme delivery. The intervention comprised of 6 weeks of exercise and education sessions, supervised by physiotherapists, nurse and general practitioner. Patient outcomes (Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Incremental Shuttle Walking Test (ISWT)) were analysed descriptively. Qualitative outcomes (feasibility, acceptability) were analysed using thematic content analysis. With minor adaptations to the original programme, 40 patients initiated (24 with COPD and 16 with asthma) and 31 completed PR (19 with COPD and 12 with asthma). Clinically important improvements in all outcomes were documented (mean differences (95% CIs) for CCQ: -0.53 (-0.81, -0.24), CAT: -5.93 (-8.27, -3.60), SGRQ: -23.00 (-29.42, -16.58), PHQ-9: -1.10 (-2.32, 0.12), ISWT: 87.39 (59.37, 115.40)). The direct PR benefits and the necessity of implementing similar initiatives in remote areas were highlighted. This study provided evidence about the multiple impacts of a PR programme, indicating that it could be both feasible and acceptable in low-resource, primary care settings.

"Understanding the distribution of wild medicinal plants and areas that are suitable for cultivation of these plants is important for both conservation and agriculture. Here, we study ten taxa with known ethnopharmacological uses, which have been used extensively in traditional medicine and as culinary supplements. We aim to (1) predict and map the potential habitat suitability for these taxa across the study area, (2) investigate spatial patterns that could have management implications, such as niche similarities among the taxa and suitability ""hotspots"" with the use of novel indices, and (3) develop a platform where parts of this information can be accessed and utilized by all interested groups, from the policy-maker level to the individual practitioner level. Ecological Niche Models developed for each study taxon, based on topographic, bioclimatic, soil, and land use variables had high predictive power and were used as the basis for suitability visualization. A series of informative indices were also calculated and mapped, revealing spatial patterns not readily observable from the single-taxon predictions, and providing valuable information to managers. Finally, a web-based, easy-to-use application was also created, where the predicted suitability scores for the study area can be made accessible to anyone interested. The application can provide information both in a visual form (i.e. maps of predicted suitability) and in a numerical form (i.e. estimated suitability scores for all taxa in a given geographical location). This study provides the scientific tools to make a step towards cultivating a group of economically important wild medicinal plants in Crete, as well as the tools to disseminate this information to decision makers and practitioners, and eventually integrate the research findings in local agricultural practices."

The European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry (EAPD) proposes this best clinical practice guidance to help practitioners decide when and how to prescribe dental radiographs in children and adolescents. Four expert working groups conducted each a systematic review of the literature. The main subjects were radiation protection, intraoral dental radiography (bitewing and periapical radiographs), panoramic radiography (PR) and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). In addition, three workshops were held during the corresponding EAPD Interim Seminar in Chania (Crete, Greece) in 2019. On the basis of the identified evidence, all invited experts presented their findings and during the workshops aspects of clinical relevance were discussed. Several clinical-based recommendations and statements were agreed upon. There is no or low-grade evidence about the efficacy of dental radiographic examinations in young populations. The given recommendations and rationales should be understood as best clinical practice guidance. It is essential to respect the radiological principles of an individualized and patient-specific justification. When a dental radiograph is required, its application needs to be optimized, aiming at limiting the patient's exposure to ionising radiation according to the ALADAIP principle (As Low As Diagnostically Achievable being Indication-oriented and Patient-specific).

"This study explores the level of support for gay and lesbian rights among social work and psychology undergraduate students (N = 870). While students were generally supportive of gay and lesbian rights, 43% believed that social workers and psychologists should support gay and lesbian rights only 'when lesbians and gay men do not offend or upset others', while 31.3% agreed that these rights should be supported 'as long as they don't contradict the prevalent religion and values of the society they live in'. Social work students were more supportive of all items compared to psychology students; they were also more supportive regarding professionals' obligation to challenge negative discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Religiosity, gender and having gay and lesbian friends or acquaintances were important correlates of students' level of support for gay and lesbian rights. Findings are discussed in relation to social work and psychology education."

"The grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars in the island of Crete, Greece represent one of the oldest populations of the species; nevertheless, very scarce information is available about its genetic structure. In this study, Vitis cultivars collected from the island of Crete were characterized using microsatellite markers. A broad germplasm collection representing 44 inferred Vitis cultivars, a total of 163 accessions, from the area of Crete including 37 wine and 7 table cultivars were fingerprinted employing thirteen (13) standardized simple sequence repeat (SSR, microsatellite) loci. SSR allelic analysis and a similarity dendrogram construction (cluster analysis) was followed by a hierarchical STRUCTURE analysis. The mean observed (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) were 0.7372 and 0.7686, respectively. The cumulative probability of identity was very low with a value of 3.18 × 10e<sup>-15</sup>. According to the cluster analysis, twenty-nine of the 44 Vitis cultivars were presented in single clusters and five cultivars were presented as distinct single accessions. In addition, ten (10) cases of synonyms and ten (10) groups of homonyms were also identified. STRUCTURE analysis provided evidence for three genetic groups (putative ancestry groups). Hierarchical STRUCTURE analysis revealed further stratification within each of the three ancestry groups. This work provides the molecular fingerprinting of 44 Vitis cultivars and an initial proposal in their ancestry. In the future, molecular genetic information along with morphological (ampelographic) data will provide an intergraded characterization of existing diversity and will allow for its use in breeding efforts and in commercial viticulture."

Bronze Age Aegean (ca. 3500-1100 B.C.) wall paintings from the islands of Crete and Thera depict monkeys in a variety of roles such as running wild in nature, possibly following (trained) commands, and participating in sacred activities. These images, while stylistically Aegean, are traditionally considered closely related to-and descendant from-Egyptian, Near Eastern, and Mesopotamian monkey imagery. While monkey depictions in the latter regions may provide species-specific characteristics, Aegean wall paintings typically lack this level of detail. In an attempt to better understand the relationships between the monkeys depicted in Aegean wall paintings and the species that were encountered by the Aegean, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian peoples, a collaborative team of primatologists, a taxonomic illustrator, and an art historian/archaeologist identified species-indicative visual characteristics. This collaborative approach led us to identify a new region that serves as a source for monkey iconography: the Indus River Valley. With an emphasis on the primatological aspect and the growing corpus of possible Indus goods and possible species found in the Aegean, a broader iconographic and socioreligious sphere of interaction emerges. In this expanded system, Mesopotamia functions as an intermediary that enables the movement of goods, raw materials, people, and iconography between the east and west. Mesopotamia may have even afforded an opportunity for Aegean peoples to encounter the creatures themselves, first-hand. Of primary importance to the methodology employed for this project is the cooperation of scholars from disparate disciplines-the stitching together of various projects and experiences in attempt to answer both new and previously unanswerable questions. This type of interdisciplinary approach can be applied to other species, sites, paintings, and objects to hone our understanding of period, place, animal, movement, and trade.

Phthalates, bisphenols A and S (BPA, BPS) are used as plasticizers and many of them are documented or suspected of being endocrine disruptors. Several studies indicate that exposure during pregnancy may affect the newborn's health and development. The aim of this cross-sectional study is the biomonitoring of seven phthalate metabolites, BPA and BPS in hair from 100 pregnant women in Crete. The most frequently detected compounds were monoethylhexyl phthalate (mEHP) (68%), mono isobutyl phthalate (miBP) (40%), BPA (37%), BPS (34%) and mono-n-butyl phthalate (mnBP) (28%). Phthalate metabolites were detected at medians from 19.5 to 44.4 pg/mg, BPA at 69.9 pg/mg and BPS at 3.5 pg/mg. Significant positive correlations between phthalate metabolites were found which indicated their common sources of exposure. The frequent use of plastics for food storage was strongly associated with mEHP (p = .013) and a weaker association was found for miBP (p = .063). The frequent use of cosmetics during or before pregnancy was associated with levels of phthalate metabolites in hair. More specifically, the use of hair spray before pregnancy was significantly correlated with monobenzyl phthalate (mBzP) (p = .041) and a trend was found for miBP (p = .066). The use of makeup products during pregnancy was strongly associated with miBP (p = .015) and the use of deodorant during pregnancy was inversely associated with mEHP (p = .021). Strong associations came up between mEHP and lower birth weight (Spearman correlation coefficient, r = -0.302, p = .021) and exposure to BPS was associated with increased body mass index of the participants (p = .036). Although data in literature on biomonitoring of the compounds in hair are limited, the findings of this study are promising and in agreement with existing data in hair or urine.

"The olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae is a major pest of olives worldwide and houses a specialized gut microbiota dominated by the obligate symbiont ""Candidatus Erwinia dacicola."" Candidatus Erwinia dacicola is thought to supplement dietary nitrogen to the host, with only indirect evidence for this hypothesis so far. Here, we sought to investigate the contribution of the symbiosis to insect fitness and explore the ecology of the insect gut. For this purpose, we examined the composition of bacterial communities associated with Cretan olive fruit fly populations, and inspected several genomes and one transcriptome assembly. We identified, and reconstructed the genome of, a novel component of the gut microbiota, Tatumella sp. TA1, which is stably associated with Mediterranean olive fruit fly populations. We also reconstructed a number of pathways related to nitrogen assimilation and interactions with the host. The results show that, despite variation in taxa composition of the gut microbial community, core functions related to the symbiosis are maintained. Functional redundancy between different microbial taxa was observed for genes involved in urea hydrolysis. The latter is encoded in the obligate symbiont genome by a conserved urease operon, likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer, based on phylogenetic evidence. A potential underlying mechanism is the action of mobile elements, especially abundant in the Ca. E. dacicola genome. This finding, along with the identification, in the studied genomes, of extracellular surface structure components that may mediate interactions within the gut community, suggest that ongoing and past genetic exchanges between microbes may have shaped the symbiosis."

This study presents an estimation of the urine volume in the wastewater from a real, private clinic in Crete, Greece, during a seven-month period (01/06/2018 to 31/12/2018). Separate estimates were obtained for the volume of urine belonging to patients receiving antibiotics. It was found that the clinic disposed into the local municipal sewage network on the average 3,263 L/month of urine, from which 1,331 L/month (40.8%) belonged to patients receiving antibiotics. According to the pharmacy department of the private clinic, during the period of the study, the most frequently administered groups of antibiotics were on the average 779 g/month cephalosporins (68.1%), 108 g/month fluoroquinolones (9.5%) and others (11.2%), with various active substances including cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and doxycycline. These active substances act like pollutants when disposed via the municipal sewer network into the environment.

Therefore, a study of D-loop region sequence was carried out to estimate the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship within and among these three populations. Among 84 griffon specimens (44 Sardinian, 33 Cretan, and 7 Cypriot), we detected four haplotypes including a novel haplotype (HPT-D) that was exclusively found in the Cretan population with a frequency of 6.1%. When considered as a unique population, haplotype diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (<i>π</i>) were high at 0.474 and 0.00176, respectively. A similar level of Hd and <i>π</i> was found in Sardinian and Cretan populations, both showing three haplotypes. The different haplotype frequencies and exclusivity detected were in accordance with the limited matrilineal gene flow (<i>F<sub>ST</sub></i>  = 0.07097), probably related to the species reluctance to fly over sea masses. The genetic variability we observe today would therefore be the result of an evolutionary process strongly influenced by isolation leading to the appearance of island variants which deserve to be protected. Furthermore, since nesting sites and food availability are essential elements for colony settlement, we may infer that the island's colonization began when the first domestic animals were transferred by humans during the Neolithic. In conclusion, our research presents a first contribution to the genetic characterization of the griffon vulture populations in the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia, Crete and Cyprus and lays the foundation for conservation and restocking programs."

Alcohol hangover is a potentially debilitating state. Several studies have demonstrated that it does not seem to impair strength or short-term endurance, but its effects on continuous exercise performance/long-term endurance have never been investigated. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess hiking performance of participants who walked the 15.8 km Samaria Gorge in Crete, Greece. Participants completed a survey in the morning before walking the Gorge, and in the afternoon after completion of the walk. Demographics, data on previous evening alcohol consumption, sleep, hangover symptoms, and walking performance were assessed. Data from N=299 participants with a mean (SD) age of 38.9 (11.0) years were analyzed. N=223 participants (74.6%) consumed alcohol the evening before walking the Samaria Gorge, and N= 176 (78.9%) of those reported a hangover. They consumed a mean (SD) of 3.0 (1.8) alcoholic drinks (10 g alcohol each) with a corresponding next-morning hangover severity of 4.6 (2.4) on a 0-10 scale. Participants with a hangover reported feeling significantly more exhausted after the walk compared to participants with no hangover. The groups did not significantly differ in duration of the walk, and the number and duration of breaks. Overall hangover severity, assessed either before, during, or after walking the Samaria Gorge was not significantly correlated with any walking outcome. In conclusion, hungover participants experienced significantly more exhaustion when performing physical activity at the same level as non-hungover participants.

"The present study investigated the clinical course, treatment pattern, prognostic factors, and outcome of patients with pun-drug resistant (PDR) infections. This was a retrospective single-center cohort study including consecutive eligible patients with a PDR infection hospitalized at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, between January 2010 and June 2018. In total, 65 patients with infections due to PDR gram-negative pathogens were identified. The median age was 64 years (interquartile range, IQR: 45.5-74.5) and the median Charlson comorbidity index 3.0 (IQR: 1.0-5.75). Of the 65 PDR isolates, 31 (48%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 28 (43%) Acinetobacter baumannii, and 6 (9%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most common empirical therapy was colistin-based combination (n = 32; 49%), followed by non-colistin, non-tigecycline combination (n = 25; 39%), and carbapenemes + tigecycline (n = 8; 12%). The empirical therapy was effective in 50%, 37.5%, and 8% of patients receiving colistin combination, carbapenemes - tigecycline, and non-colistin, non-tigecycline combination, respectively (p value = 0.003). The infection-related in-hospital mortality was 32% (95% confidence interval, CI: 21-45%). Three factors were significantly associated with infection-related in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis: Charlson comorbidity index (odds ratio, OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-2.3, p value = 0.030), prior steroid use (OR: 4.1, 95% CI: 1.0-17.0, p value = 0.049), and empirical treatment with non-colistin, non-tigecycline combination (OR: 7.5; 95% CI: 1.7-32.8, p value = 0.008). Infections due to PDR pathogens are associated with considerable mortality. Our results support the use of colistin and/or tigecycline-based combinations as empirical therapy when infection due to PDR pathogens is suspected."

A herbicide and antibiotic-resistant microalgal strain, isolated from a eutrophic site at Giofyros river (Heraklion, Crete, Greece) was extensively characterized. In the presence of relatively high concentrations of common photosynthesis inhibitors (DCMU and atrazine), as well as various antibiotics (spectinomycin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol), the green microalga was able to increase its biomass in approximately equal levels compared to the control. Despite the high concentrations of the inhibitors, photosynthetic efficiency and chlorophyll a amount per dry cell biomass were comparable to those of control cultures in almost all cases. 18S rDNA analysis showed that this microalga belongs to the Chlorella genus. Optical and electron microscopy studies revealed the presence of an extensive extracellular matrix (EM) that surrounds the cells and plays an important role in colony formation and cell-cell interactions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy provided evidence that the EM consists of a polysaccharide. This matrix could be separated from the cells with a simple centrifugation. Depending on growth conditions, the dry cell biomass of this Chlorella strain was found to contain 35-39% proteins and 27-42% carbohydrates. The results of this study have demonstrated that the EM plays a protective role for cell homeostasis maintenance against the various chemical agents. This green microalga is a suitable candidate for further studies regarding sustainable biomass production in waste waters for a series of applications.

"The characteristics of desert dust storms (DDS) have been shown to change in response to climate change and land use. There is limited information on the frequency and intensity of DDS over the last decade at a regional scale in the Eastern Mediterranean. An algorithm based on daily ground measurements (PM<sub>10</sub>, particulate matter ≤10 μm), satellite products (dust aerosol optical depth) and meteorological parameters, was used to identify dust intrusions for three Eastern Mediterranean locations (Crete-Greece, Cyprus, and Israel) between 2006 and 2017. Days with 24-hr average PM<sub>10</sub> concentration above ~30 μg/m<sup>3</sup> were found to be a significant indicator of DDS for the background sites of Cyprus and Crete. Higher thresholds were found for Israel depending on the season (fall and spring: PM<sub>10</sub> &gt; 70 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, winter and summer: PM<sub>10</sub> &gt; 90 μg/m<sup>3</sup>). We observed a high variability in the frequency and intensity of DDS during the last decade, characterized by a steady trend with sporadic peaks. The years with the highest DDS frequency were not necessarily the years with the most intense episodes. Specifically, the highest dust frequency was observed in 2010 at all three locations, but the highest annual median dust-PM<sub>10</sub> level was observed in 2012 in Crete (55.8 μg/m<sup>3</sup>) and Israel (137.4 μg/m<sup>3</sup>), and in 2010 in Cyprus (45.3 μg/m<sup>3</sup>). Crete and Cyprus experienced the same most intense event in 2006, with 24 h-PM<sub>10</sub> average of 705.7 μg/m<sup>3</sup> and 1254.6 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, which originated from Sahara desert. The highest 24 h-PM10 average concentration for Israel was observed in 2010 (3210.9 μg/m<sup>3</sup>) during a three-day Saharan dust episode. However, a sub-analysis for Cyprus (years 2000-2017) suggests a change in DDS seasonality pattern, intensity, and desert of origin. For more robust conclusions on DDS trends in relation to climate change, future work needs to study data over several decades from different locations."

"Vaccination coverage of general practitioners (GPs) is important for their own and for their colleagues' and patients' protection and has been associated with the coverage of the general population. Our study aims to evaluate the vaccination practices of GPs in Crete, Greece. Cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey. All practicing GPs in Crete (n = 294) were surveyed either by questionnaires or by phone call. We assessed the vaccination coverage and practices for influenza, measles, hepatitis B, and pertussis (booster Tdap dose) and the reasons for nonvaccination for influenza. A total of 260 (88% response rate) GPs participated. Vaccination rates were 56% for influenza (current season), 26% for measles (two doses), 68% for hepatitis B (three doses), and 18% for the booster dose with Tdap. Negligence (47%) and perceived low risk (29.6%) were the most common reasons for nonvaccination for influenza. History of natural measles infection was reported by 169 (65%) GPs, but none of the interviewed 31 provided laboratory confirmation. GPs with self-reported natural measles infection were less vaccinated than their peers (10% vs 55%, P &lt; 0.001). Finally, 23 of 130 (18%) GPs contacted by phone falsely reported vaccination with Tdap in their childhood, when Tdap was not yet available. This study revealed insufficient vaccination rates and misconceptions among GPs that should be the focus of future evidence-based interventions with potential to significantly improve vaccination coverage of GPs and indirectly of their patients."

"Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 loss-of-function variants have been linked to increased breast and ovarian cancer risk, with more than 5,000 distinct pathogenic variants being reported worldwide. Among individuals of Greek descent, the BRCA1/2 variant spectrum is heterogeneous, but characterized by strong founder effects. As patients from certain geographical regions of Greece (like Crete) were underrepresented in previous studies, we hypothesized that isolated Cretans, a southern Greece islanders' population with distinct demographic, cultural and genetic features, could harbor founder BRCA1/2 mutations. A total of 304 breast or/and ovarian cancer patients of Cretan descent, fulfilling NCCN criteria for genetic testing, were tested by NGS or Sanger sequencing, followed by MLPA. Haplotype analysis was subsequently performed to investigate potential founder effects of recurrent alleles. Overall, 16.5% (50/304) of the tested patients carried 22 different pathogenic variants; 48% in BRCA1, 52% in BRCA2. Three variants, namely two in BRCA2 (Δexons 12 and 13 and c.7806-2A&gt;T) and one in BRCA1 (c.5492del), constituting approximately half (48%) of all detected pathogenic variants, were shown to have a founder effect, with all carriers sharing common haplotypes. Remarkably, these variants were confined to Cretans and have not been identified in other regions of Greece. The high prevalence of specific BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants among Cretans, provides the possibility of cost- and time-efficient screening of the Cretan population. Integrating this knowledge in local public health services may have a significant impact on cancer prevention, and may serve as a starting point for the implementation of testing on a population level."

Mediterranean islands have complex reptile assemblages, but little is known about the factors that determine their organization. In this study, the structure of assemblages of Squamata was evaluated based on their species richness and two measures of phylogenetic diversity (variability and clustering). I evaluated the composition of the assemblages comparing distinct biogeographic subregions within the Mediterranean: Adriatic, Aegean, Balearic, Corsica-Sardinia, Crete, Gulf of Gabés, Ionian Sea, Ligurian Sea, Malta, Sicily, and Tyrrhenian Sea. The effect of island environments and geographical isolation on the diversity metrics was assessed using generalized linear models. The analyses indicated that species richness was mostly influenced by island area and geographical isolation. Assemblages on smaller islands were poorer in species and phylogenetically dispersed, possibly as an effect of interspecific competition. The species composition of the assemblages was determined by similar environmental drivers within the biogeographic subregions, including island area, island elevation, geographical isolation, and aridity. In several subregions, significant patterns of phylogenetic attraction were found in species co-occurrences, caused by the limits imposed by the island size on large predatory species.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis is often associated with stress, depression, and major lifestyle changes. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore patients' experiences of living with CKD. A non-random purposeful sampling strategy was used to recruit 10 patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis, from a tertiary care hospital in Crete, Greece. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with open-ended questions aiming to assess different aspects of their life after CKD diagnosis. Four main themes were revealed portraying participants' experience, including facing a new reality, 2) confronting changes, 3) finding ways to cope, and 4) continuing life.

Patients with dementia report excessive daytime sleep/sleepiness, which is associated with worse cognitive performance. Inflammatory markers may be elevated in patients with dementia and have been proposed as mediators of sleep/sleepiness. To examine the association of objective daytime napping with cognitive performance and peripheral markers of inflammation in patients with dementia as compared to not cognitively impaired (NCI) controls. A sub-sample of 46 patients with mild-to-moderate dementia and 85 NCI controls, were recruited from a large, population-based cohort of 3,140 elders (≥60 years) in Crete, Greece. All participants underwent medical history/physical examination, extensive neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological evaluation, 3-day 24 h actigraphy and a single morning measure of IL-6 and TNFα plasma levels. Comparisons of sleep parameters and inflammation markers between diagnostic groups, and between nappers and non-nappers within each diagnostic group, were conducted using ANCOVA controlling for demographics/related clinical factors. Associations between inflammatory markers, sleep variables, and neuropsychological performance were assessed within each group using partial correlation analysis controlling for confounders. Patients with dementia slept 15 minutes longer during the day than NCI. Within dementia patients, nappers had significantly worse performance on autobiographic memory (p = 0.002), working memory (p = 0.007), episodic memory (p = 0.010), and assessment of daily function (p = 0.012) than non-nappers. Finally, IL-6 levels were significantly associated with nap duration within dementia patients who napped (r = 0.500, p = 0.01). Daytime napping in patients with dementia is associated with worse cognitive performance and increased IL-6 levels. In dementia, objective daytime napping, may be a marker of the severity of the disease.

"In Greece, both Primary Health Care (PHC) system and National Health System (NHS) in general, were plagued by several inefficiencies even prior to the financial crisis; the imposed austerity measures dramatically worsened the level of health provision and access, especially for vulnerable social groups, resulting in an exacerbation of existing disparities and access gaps. The current branch study was conducted in two regions of Greece, namely Crete and Epirus, with the main aim of eliciting responses to gather baseline information regarding crucial PHC-related aspects, using questionnaires with dichotomous questions. Directors or managers (physicians who have been assigned administrative/governance duties), of the Primary Health Care Centres (PHCCs) in two Greek geographic and administrative regions of Crete and Epirus, were invited to participate and to contribute to the investigation of issues on the provision of prevention and health promotion services, e-health topics and primary care research. Thirty directors/managers were approached and twenty-eight agreed to participate. Data processing and analysis of the responses was performed for the completed questionnaires. Data analysis did not demonstrate a surprisingly substantial deviation in the average score of positive responses of directors/managers in the PHCCs of Crete in comparison to those of directors/managers in the PHCCs of Epirus. The findings show that several gaps exist in terms of prevention and health promotion resources and activities in both regions, while e-health, electronic health record (EHR) and telemedicine services are poorly developed. The study confirms that the Greek PHC is characterized by several inefficiencies, which may affect the quality of the services provided. An overall deficit has been emerged for PHCCs in both regions, a fact that indicates crucial points lacking in terms of overall PHC provision, thus adversely impacting upon living conditions, health quality and prevention.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity with early diagnosis being a major challenge, complicated by the absence of formal diagnostic criteria. Instead, classification criteria have been developed to enable the homogenous inclusion of patients in clinical trials, with the most commonly used those of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR 1997) and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Classification Criteria (SLICC 2012). These criteria are widely used in clinical practice as diagnostic tools, although they fail to diagnose up to 20% of patients with SLE or may delay diagnosis. These restrictions have led to the recent (2018) introduction of new classification criteria jointly by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and ACR. We will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the earlier and new classification criteria after a systematic analysis (retrospective study) of a group of SLE patients. In addition, we will examine which set of criteria permits the earliest classification of the disease in a prospective cohort of patients with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD). The prognostic impact (permanent organ damage) of the classification of SLE patients with the three sets of criteria will also be examined. Data from the existing Cretan lupus registry will be used to retrospectively include consecutively registered patients aged ≥15 years diagnosed with SLE during 01/2005-12/2016 by an expert physician and followed-up for at least 6 months. All sets of criteria (ACR 1997, SLICC 2012, EULAR/ACR 2018) will be tested at the time of physician-based diagnosis and also at last follow-up. A prospective study arm will include cases with a diagnosis of UCTD and will be followed-up in the outpatient clinic for 3-5 years. This is the first study to include the application of the new criteria (EULAR/ACR 2018) to a group of SLE patients. Determining their diagnostic value in comparison to existing criteria or diagnosis by a specialist will provide important information both for the value of their application at the level of clinical studies and for their use in clinical practice as diagnostic criteria.
PMID:32212145	Tsiamis C, Vrioni G, Tsakris A	Int Marit Health. 71(1):28-33	2020	Lessons from a historic example of diving safety rules violation: the case of Greek sponge divers. 	This study presents a historical example of systematic safety rules violations by professional sponge divers in Greece during the early 20th century. In light of absolute unaccountability in favour of economic competition and in the absence of state oversight, the profession of sponge diving had developed into a deadly undertaking. The study is based on a report compiled by Professor of Hygiene and Microbiology Konstantinos Savvas, which was addressed to the Ministry of Marine Affairs. Savvas' report rested on data concerning hospitalised divers derived from the medical records of warship 'Kriti' (Crete), which escorted groups of Greek fishing vessels to four of their expedition in the Mediterranean over the period 1900-1903. Although the events explored herein took place at a time much different from the modern era with its numerous advancements in hyperbaric medicine, enhanced divers' professionalism and the establishment of labour rights and strict safety regulations, we should not overlook the human factor of professional exploitation that leads to the violation of safety rules. On the other hand, supervisory authorities entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing professional activities ought to be vigilant on a constant basis, especially in times of economic crisis that may lead to lax state functioning.

"Hoplopholcus Kulczyński, 1908 is a genus of relatively large pholcid spiders, ranging from eastern Central Europe to Crete, the Levant, and Georgia. Species in this genus are often difficult to distinguish from each other, and the reexamination of previously published material revealed many misidentifications. The present study provides redescriptions of the ten previously described species and descriptions of six new species, all based on males and females: Hoplopholcus suluin sp. n., H. konya sp. n., H. atik sp. n., and H. bursa sp. n. from Turkey, H. gazipasa sp. n. from Turkey and Greece, and H. dim sp. n. from Turkey and Cyprus. The main conclusion is that several species need further investigation, based on focused sampling and ideally including molecular data. Some species seem to include morphologically distinct epigean and hypogean populations; others may eventually need to be split into two or more species. Further undescribed species are most likely to occur in Turkey."

Research has shown that socio-demographic profile and psychopathology symptoms are related to levels of happiness in old age. The aims of this cross-sectional study were: 1) to investigate the effect of recent stressful life events and socio-demographic factors on psychopathological symptoms in elderly residents in mountain regions of Crete, Greece and 2) to explore the mechanism which underlies the relationship between socio-demographic factors and psychopathological symptoms, with levels of happiness in old age. To this end, we used the nine psychopathology dimensions of symptoms as defined in the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90), while the Holmes and Rahe stress inventory was administered to quantify the stressful life events. A sample of 205 elderly men and women (age=77.1±6.7 years) living in 10 remote rural and isolated villages participated in this study. Data was collected through questionnaires completed upon individual meetings with each participant, with the interviewer's assistance. Each questionnaire included the two aforesaid scales alongside questions on individual socio-demographic characteristics. Analysis of variance was applied to detect socio-demographic factors that have a significant effect on specific psychopathological symptoms. Then, path analysis was applied to quantify the direct and indirect effect of the selected socio-demographic factors on happiness levels. Stressful life events were found to have no statistically significant effect on the presence of specific symptoms (somatization, psychoticism, anxiety) in elderly adults. Furthermore, certain socio-demographic factors (marital status, smoking, family income and social activity) were found to influence happiness, which varied according to the level of psycho-emotional tension. The results suggest that somatization, psychoticism, and phobic anxiety symptoms are psychic reactions independent of recent stressful life events. Our study,despite its regional character, may contribute in the development of appropriate clinical assessment tools and interventions, helping primary care practitioners to approach elderly people living in remote villages in a more appropriate and holistic manner, improving thereby the effectiveness of their interventions.

In the present study, we examined factors that may impact immigrants' anxiety and depressive symptoms, focusing on the role of acculturation attitudes and social support. The participants of the present study were first generation Indian immigrants residing in Crete, Greece (N=114). Our first hypothesis was that Indian immigrants will choose two acculturation attitudes, namely integration and separation, as these may enable them maintain certain aspects of their culture of origin given their distinct differences from Greeks in religion, cultural values, and physical appearance. It was also hypothesized that integration and separation will be positively related to social support. Social support was also expected to mediate the negative relationship of separation and integration to anxiety and depression. Furthermore, social support was expected to act protectively for Indian immigrants who chose integration and separation, minimizing the levels of anxiety and depression (i.e., a moderation effect). Using specific measures for anxiety, depression, social support, and acculturation attitudes, the results showed that Indian immigrants report a greater preference for integration and separation. Separation was the only acculturation attitude positively related to social support and negatively to depression through social support from friends and family. Moreover, higher levels of social support seemed to protected immigrants who choose integration from depression and medium and high levels of social support protected immigrants who choose assimilation from anxiety. These findings indicate that both integration and separation are preferred by Indian immigrants in Greece. Moreover, it seems that in the case of Indian immigrants in Greece, separation could be related to more immigrants' social support than other acculturation attitudes, ending in turn to less depression symptoms. These findings demonstrate that different acculturation attitudes (i.e. assimilation, integration, separation) may have different effects on distinct psychological indices. Moreover, immigrants' social support is a protecting factor in the relationship between acculturation attitudes to anxiety and depression. The present study suggests that the increase of the immigrants' social networks could prove helpful for their adaptation to the Greek society.

"Very few data are available regarding the use of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) near the end-of-life, i.e., the final month. The aim of this study was to provide a descriptive analysis of its use in two different European geographic areas (Sweden and Greece). We retrospectively collected data regarding clinicopathologic characteristics, survival, and use of chemotherapy during the final 30 days of life using two sources: for the Swedish cohort, patients who were diagnosed with MBC in 2010-2015 were identified from the Stockholm-Gotland population-based Breast Cancer Registry and treatment data were collected using hospital charts. For the Greek cohort, patients with MBC were identified from hospital charts at two hospitals in Athens and Crete. In the Swedish cohort, 1571 patients were identified; median overall survival was 16.96 months (95% CI 15.4-18.4). 23.2% of patients were treated with chemotherapy during the final month of life, with higher rates among patients ≤ 60 years (p &lt; 0.001). Per OS monotherapy such as capecitabine or vinorelbine was most commonly used. In contrast, median OS in the Greek cohort (n = 966) was 49.8 months (95% CI 45.6-54.1) and 46.5% of patients received chemotherapy at the end-of-life, most commonly intravenous drug combinations. In multivariable analysis, age and albumin levels were statistically significantly associated with chemotherapy use in the Swedish cohort. Chemotherapy use near the end-of-life was common, which might negatively impact patient quality of life."

Here, we examined the grazing potential of heterotrophic (HF) and pigmented (PF) nanoflagellates as a response mechanism to phosphate amendment. Flagellate grazing effect on bacteria was quantified in P-amended nutrient-depleted water from the Cretan Sea over the course of 4 days using microcosm experiments. P-addition positively affected HF abundance, while PF abundance remained unchanged. At the community level, P-addition had a negative effect on PF bacterial removal rates. In the control, PF-grazing rate was significantly higher than that of HF throughout the experiment. Pigment analysis showed no changes in phytoplankton community composition as a result of P-addition, indicating that PF grazing rate declined as a physiological response of the cells. The present study emphasizes the dominant grazing role of PF under P-depleted conditions and reveals that during the late stratified season PF respond to P-addition by lowering their grazing rates, enhancing the relative importance of bacterial removal by HF."

Over the last decade, knowledge has significantly increased on the taxonomic identity and distribution of dinoflagellates of the genera <i>Gambierdiscus</i> and <i>Fukuyoa</i>. Additionally, a number of hitherto unknown bioactive metabolites have been described, while the role of these compounds in ciguatera poisoning (CP) remains to be clarified. Ciguatoxins and maitotoxins are very toxic compounds produced by these dinoflagellates and have been described since the 1980s. Ciguatoxins are generally described as the main contributors to this food intoxication. Recent reports of CP in temperate waters of the Canary Islands (Spain) and the Madeira archipelago (Portugal) triggered the need for isolation and cultivation of dinoflagellates from these areas, and their taxonomic and toxicological characterization. Maitotoxins, and specifically maitotoxin-4, has been described as one of the most toxic compounds produced by these dinoflagellates (e.g., <i>G. excentricus</i>) in the Canary Islands. Thus, characterization of toxin profiles of <i>Gambierdiscus</i> species from adjacent regions appears critical. The combination of liquid chromatography coupled to either low- or high-resolution mass spectrometry allowed for characterization of several strains of <i>Gambierdiscus</i> and <i>Fukuyoa</i> from the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands. Maitotoxin-3, two analogues tentatively identified as gambieric acid C and D, a putative gambierone analogue and a putative gambieroxide were detected in all <i>G. australes</i> strains from Menorca and Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain) while only maitotoxin-3 was present in an <i>F. paulensis</i> strain of the same region. An unidentified <i>Gambierdiscus</i> species (<i>Gambierdiscus</i> sp.2) from Crete (Greece) showed a different toxin profile, detecting both maitotoxin-3 and gambierone, while the availability of a <i>G. excentricus</i> strain from the Canary Islands (Spain) confirmed the presence of maitotoxin-4 in this species. Overall, this study shows that toxin profiles not only appear to be species-specific but probably also specific to larger geographic regions.

"Vaccination is recommended for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to protect them against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs); however, uptake rates are low. This study aimed to evaluate HCPs' influenza, hepatitis B, and measles vaccine uptake in all healthcare levels in Crete, Greece. We conducted a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional multicenter study in 2018, including HCPs employed at 18 primary care centers and 3 hospitals. Overall, 2,246 HCPs responded (57.2% of the target population). The influenza vaccine uptake rate was 36.1% (810/2,246), with the annual vaccination rate at 14.8% (332/2,246) over the previous 5 years. Concurrently, the hepatitis B 3-dose vaccine uptake rate was 60.3% (1,316/2,181). Among the participating HCPs, 70.7% (1,457/2,061) had measles immunity due to previous illness (959/2,061, 46.5%), a 2-dose vaccination scheme (461/2,061, 22.4%), or serological confirmation (37/2,061, 1.8%). Vaccine uptake rates differed between groups depending on age, profession, and workplace setting. Logistic regression analysis revealed that risk factors for no influenza vaccine uptake during the previous season were younger age (≤45 years; odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.66), profession other than physician (OR 2.94, 95%CI: 2.09-4.12), and working in hospitals (OR 1.39, 95%CI 1.02-1.89). Older age (&gt;45 years) was an independent risk factor for not receiving a measles (OR 26.74, 95%CI: 17.41-41.06) or hepatitis B vaccine (OR 1.36, 95%CI 1.09-1.7). Working in primary care was an independent risk factor for not getting a hepatitis B vaccine (OR 1.52, 95%CI: 1.15-2.1). Our findings indicate that individualized and targeted interventions should be implemented to increase vaccine uptake among HCPs."

(Primates, 61:159-168,  https://doi.org/10.1007/s10329-019-00778-1 2020) published a report suggesting that the monkeys represented by Minoans in Room 6 of Building Complex Beta at Akrotiri, Thera (present-day Greece) allegedly represented Hanuman or gray langurs (Semnopithecus spp.). This conjecture was based only on the posture of the tail, as it might be reminiscent of those observed in these Asian monkeys. In order to examine this hypothesis, we performed a thorough analysis of tail postures in both langurs and vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus spp.), a detailed description of body and facial characteristics of the Minoan painted monkeys, and an exhaustive review of the current evidence regarding Minoan archeoprimatological frescos and portable objects as well as proposed cultural and trading contacts between the Bronze Age Aegean, Egypt, the Levant, Near East, and the Indus River Valley. Our findings show that their assumption is unfounded and that the monkeys depicted on the walls of the referred fresco, as well as others related frescoes from Thera and Crete, are of African origin and more specifically belong to Chlorocebus spp. and Papio spp. In all cases, hopefully Pareja et al. (2020) and this reply will serve to stimulate further archeoprimatological studies.

"Accurate estimation of exposure to Secondhand Smoke (SHS) is important in both research and clinical practice. We aimed to develop, an easy to implement, biomarker validated scale to provide an estimation of adult exposure to SHS for use within primary health care or epidemiological research. A pool of 26 baseline questions evaluating exposure to SHS was administered to 178 non-smoking adults (mean age 68.1 years), recruited from both urban and rural primary health care practices in Crete, Greece in November 2011, while concurrent hair samples were collected and nicotine concentrations were measured. To generate scores for each question item, we fitted a backward linear regression using the main predictors of SHS exposure selected from the initial pool of questions, weighted against each individuals biomarker evaluated exposure. Among the pool of participants and weighted according to hair nicotine levels, in descending order, the most important sources of SHS exposure were the home (5 points, β=0.37), the family car (3 points, β=0.20), public places (2 points, β=0.15) and the workplace (1 point, β=0.013), the relative weighting of which led to the development of an 11-point scale to assess exposure to SHS. For every unit increase in the score, there was an associated increase in mean hair nicotine concentrations by 1.35 ng/mg (95%CI: 1.25-1.45, p&lt;0.0001). The SHS exposure score (SHSES) may be a useful tool in an estimating the level of the exposure to SHS among elderly adults and investigating the relationship between SHS exposure and potential health outcomes."

During grape cultivation and wine production, the most effective way to prevent ochratoxin A (OTA) contamination of grapes and wine is to control ochratoxigenic fungal species, especially Aspergillus carbonarius, using appropriate cultivation techniques. In this study, the influence of an organic farming system (OFS) and an integrated farming system (IFS) on the incidence of A. carbonarius on grapes, and OTA contamination of wine, were examined. Mycological analysis of grapes collected from Kotsifali cultivar (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyards and grown under two farming systems (OFS and IFS) was performed over two growing seasons. For the same two growing seasons, OTA levels of representative wine samples from wineries located in the same area, made from the same cultivar (single varietal or covinificated with Mandilari), and grown under the two farming systems were determined. The results showed that the farming system had a significant influence on the incidence of A. carbonarius, with IFS being the most effective in the control of the fungus and the prevention of OTA occurrence in wine. This knowledge could offer viticulturists a useful tool to produce safer grapes, giving winemakers an incentive to make low-OTA wine.

Familial dilated cardiomyopathy predominantly affects younger adults and may cause advanced heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Therefore, detailed family history, family members screening, appropriate genetic testing and counselling may allow correct identification of cardiac remodeling etiology, as well as earlier disease detection. Accordingly, we present a case with an early diagnosis of an X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy guided by clinical features, cardiac MRI and genetic testing. The diagnostic workup was guided by the positive family history of cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac deaths. Clinical implications including early management, better arrythmia risk stratification and the revealing of a potential endemic entity clustering in several male subjects of a community on Crete island are further discussed.

The Northern Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe, including the nominate and the two subspecies O. o. leucorhoa and O. o. libanotica) and the Seebohm's Wheatear (Oenanthe seebohmi) are today regarded as two distinct species. Before, all four taxa were regarded as four subspecies of the Northern Wheatear. Their classification has exclusively been based on ecological and morphological traits, while their molecular characterization is still missing. With this study, we used next-generation sequencing to assemble 117 complete mitochondrial genomes covering O. o. oenanthe, O. o. leucorhoa and O. seebohmi. We compared the resolution power of each individual mitochondrial marker and concatenated marker sets to reconstruct the phylogeny and estimate speciation times of three taxa. Moreover, we tried to identify the origin of migratory wheatears caught on Helgoland (Germany) and on Crete (Greece). Mitogenome analysis revealed two different ancient lineages that separated around 400,000 years ago. Both lineages consisted of a mix of subspecies and species. The phylogenetic trees, as well as haplotype networks are incongruent with the present morphology-based classification. Mitogenome could not distinguish these presumed species. The genetic panmixia among present populations and taxa might be the consequence of mitochondrial introgression between ancient wheatear populations.

Very Brief Advice on smoking (VBA) is an evidence-based intervention designed to increase quit attempts among patients who smoke. VBA has been widely disseminated in general practice settings in the United Kingdom, however its transferability to Southern European settings is not well established. This study sought to document the perspectives of Greek general practice patients in terms of the acceptability and satisfaction with receiving VBA from their general practitioner (GP) and its influence on patients' motivation to make a quit attempt. We also examine patient identified barriers and facilitators to acting on VBA. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 50 patients who reported current tobacco use recruited from five general practices in Crete, Greece. All patients received VBA from their GP and interviews were conducted immediately after the GP appointment. Thematic analysis was used to analyze data. The majority of patients were satisfied with the VBA intervention. Approximately one quarter of patients reported they were motivated to make an attempt to quit smoking after receiving VBA from their GP. Patients identified a clear preference for VBA to be delivered in a supportive manner, which communicated genuine concern versus fear-based approaches. Patients with an existing smoking-related illness were more likely to report plans to act on their GP's VBA. Patients not ready to quit smoking indicated they would be likely to seek the support of their GP for future quit attempts as a result of VBA. Many patients reported low self-efficacy with quitting and apprehension about available quit smoking supports. VBA was positively received by the majority of smokers interviewed. Participating patients confirmed the motivational role of advice when delivered in a supportive and caring manner. Personal health status, beliefs about quit smoking supports, and low self-efficacy appear to influence patient's motivation to make an aided quit attempt.

Ready to Eat (RTE) cooked meat products are among the most consumed RTE food subcategories in the EU. They are also associated with the highest number of listeriosis cases per year. Contamination with <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> may arise from post-processing and its growth is often supported by the pH and water activity of the product. <i>L. monocytogenes</i> may grow during refrigeration and reach unacceptable levels at the time of consumption, posing a public health risk. The aim of this study was to conduct a Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) of <i>L. monocytogenes</i> in a traditional Italian RTE cooked meat product. Data for the risk assessment included prevalence and concentration of the microorganism, temperature-time conditions during transport and storage, information on the growth of the microorganism and its potential for disease (dose-response). These data were obtained from laboratory analysis of product samples (n = 50), a consumer survey (n = 160), recordings of temperatures of domestic refrigerators (n = 60) and were complemented with information from the literature. The data were described with appropriate probability distributions and introduced into a previously described growth model of <i>L. monocytogenes</i>. Based on the above components, a probabilistic model was created to evaluate the growth of <i>L. monocytogenes</i> at each stage of the product pathway (retail storage, transportation and domestic storage) using Monte Carlo simulations. The model design for this pathogen/food product combination, alongside with the findings of the study are included in a separate publication (manuscript under preparation). The results may help risk managers to apply appropriate control measures to minimise the public health risk. The project contributed to further education of the fellow, especially in the use of QMRA risk analysis tools and laid the foundations for future collaborations between the fellow's home institution, the University of Crete, Greece and the University of Perugia, Italy.

Purpose This study investigated component skills in oral language development utilizing and validating a new assessment battery in a large (<i>N</i> = 800) and representative sample of Greek students 4-7 years of age. Method All participants enrolled in public schools from four geographical regions (Attica, Thessaly, Macedonia, and Crete) that varied demographically (urban, semiurban, and rural). For the individualized language assessments, we utilized mobile devices (tablet PC) to ensure children's interest and joyful participation as well as reliable administration procedures across sites. Results by confirmatory factor analyses specified and validated five different models in each grade to identify the best conceptualization of language dimensionality in the respective age groups. Results Four-dimensional model provided a slightly better discriminant validity in language data of the preschool group. However, in kindergarten and first grades, the five-dimensional model had the best fit to the data to the four-dimensional. Conclusion These findings support the multidimensionality of oral language ability at this phase of development and increase of factor distinctiveness as children grow.

Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (Nematoda, Metastrongyloidea) causes verminous pneumonia in cats worldwide. This study evaluated the seroprevalence of A. abstrusus antibodies in 220 stray and free-roaming cats from insular (Mykonos, Crete, Skopelos) and continental (Thessaloniki, Attica) Greece. The results were compared with morphological and biomolecular identification of first-stage larvae (L1) in faeces. Positive cats were observed in all 5 areas: 13/97 (13.4%), 1/32 (3.1%), 7/26 (26.9%), 3/18 (16.7%) and 5/47 (10.6%) cats tested positive for A. abstrusus L1 by Baermann examination, and 33/97 (34.0%), 7/32 (21.9%), 6/26 (23.1%), 3/18 (16.7%) and 11/47 (23.4%) were seropositive, in Mykonos, Crete, Skopelos, Thessaloniki and Attica, respectively. Troglostrongylus brevior L1 were found in 12/97 (12.4%), 3/26 (11.5%) and 2/47 (4.3%) cats from Mykonos, Skopelos and Attica respectively. Six of the 220 cats (2.7%), i.e. 4/97 (4.1%) from Mykonos and 2/26 (7.7%) from Skopelos, shed L1 of both A. abstrusus and T. brevior. Sixty samples were ELISA-positive (27.3%, 95% CI: 21.5-33.7%), of which 21 (35%) tested copromicroscopically positive (19 monospecific infections and 2 mixed with Troglostrongylus brevior), and 5 were positive for T. brevior L1 only. Among seronegative cats (n = 140), L1 of A. abstrusus were additionally detected in 8 (5.7% out of 140) cats (i.e. 4 monospecific infections and 4 mixed with T. brevior), and in 6 (4.3% out of 140) cats, L1 of T. brevior as monospecific infection were detected. This study confirms the presence of lungworms in Greece and suggests that the number of cats infected with/exposed to metastrongylids is higher than detected by faecal examinations.

Human-induced biodiversity loss has been accelerating since the industrial revolution. The climate change impacts will severely alter the biodiversity and biogeographical patterns at all scales, leading to biotic homogenization. Due to underfunding, a climate smart, conservation-prioritization scheme is needed to optimize species protection. Spatial phylogenetics enable the identification of endemism centers and provide valuable insights regarding the eco-evolutionary and conservation value, as well as the biogeographical origin of a given area. Many studies exist regarding the conservation prioritization of mainland areas, yet none has assessed how climate change might alter the biodiversity and biogeographical patterns of an island biodiversity hotspot. Thus, we conducted a phylogenetically informed, conservation prioritization study dealing with the effects of climate change on Crete's plant diversity and biogeographical patterns. Using several macroecological analyses, we identified the current and future endemism centers and assessed the impact of climate change on the biogeographical patterns in Crete. The highlands of Cretan mountains have served as both diversity cradles and museums, due to their stable climate and high topographical heterogeneity, providing important ecosystem services. Historical processes seem to have driven diversification and endemic species distribution in Crete. Due to the changing climate and the subsequent biotic homogenization, Crete's unique bioregionalization, which strongly reminiscent the spatial configuration of the Pliocene/Pleistocene Cretan paleo-islands, will drastically change. The emergence of the 'Anthropocene' era calls for the prioritization of biodiversity-rich areas, serving as mixed-endemism centers, with high overlaps among protected areas and climatic refugia.

To evaluate the bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibilities of pathogens isolated from contact lens-related bacterial keratitis cases in a large academic Greek hospital. All adult patients with positive corneal scrapings or contact lens culture between 2007 and 2016 at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece, were retrospectively identified through a local microbiology database and their medical records were reviewed. A total of 240 isolates were recovered from 131 patients with culture-proven contact lens-associated bacterial keratitis. The most common microorganism identified was Serratia marcescens (17.1% of total isolates), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Rates of aztreonam-resistant P. aeruginosa and erythromycin-resistant CoNS decreased in recent years, while the decrease in oxacillin-resistant CoNS was statistically significant (p=0.009). More than 90% of the isolated organisms (S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and CoNS) were susceptible to ciprofloxacin or gentamicin. Gram-negative microorganisms are the most common causative pathogens of contact lens-related keratitis in the region of Crete. Topical antibacterials containing quinolones or gentamicin represent an effective empirical treatment for the majority of the cases. This is quite encouraging, considering that the present study was conducted in a country characterised by high antimicrobial resistance rates. However, culture-driven antimicrobial treatment is mandatory for this sight-threatening infection.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is an important component of the Mediterranean diet and a highly priced product. Despite the strict legislation to protect it from fraudulent practices, there is an increasing demand to characterize EVOOs and evaluate their authenticity. For this purpose, 68 monovarietal EVOOs, originating from three regions of Greece (Peloponnese, Crete, and Lesvos) and two local cultivars (Koroneiki and Kolovi), were obtained during the harvesting period of 2018-2019. Fatty acids, squalene, and tocopherols were determined chromatographically according to official methods in order to study the effect of cultivar and geographical origin. Squalene and γ-tocopherol differed significantly amongst the cultivars tested. Koroneiki samples exhibited higher squalene content than Kolovi samples, whereas the opposite was observed for γ-tocopherol. The tocopherol level was highly geographical dependent, with EVOOs from Peloponnese displaying the highest concentration of α-tocopherol, whereas the content of γ-tocopherol was significantly higher in samples from Lesvos. Unsupervised and supervised multivariate analysis resulted in a satisfactory grouping of EVOOs according to cultivar. γ-Tocopherol, squalene, and the majority of fatty acids were the most discriminant variables, with γ-tocopherol, linoleic, linolenic, and gadoleic acid being present at higher levels in samples from the Kolovi cultivar. Koroneiki samples were characterized with higher levels of squalene, palmitic, palmitoleic, and arachidic acid.

Land Cover monitoring is an essential task for a better understanding of the ecosystem's dynamicity and complexity. The availability of Remote Sensing data improved the Land Use Land Cover mapping as it is routine work in ecosystem management. The complexity of the Mediterranean ecosystems involves a complexity of the surrounding environmental factors. An attempt to quantitatively investigate the interdependencies between land covers and affected environmental factors was conducted in Nisos Elafonisos to represent diverse and fragile coastal Mediterranean ecosystems. Sentinel-2 (MSI) sensor and ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were used to classify the LULC as well as to draw different vegetation conditions over the designated study area. DEM derivatives were conducted and incorporated. The developed methodology is intended to assess the land use land cover for different practices under the present environmental condition of Nisos Elafonisos. Supervised classification resulted in six different land cover clusters and was tested against three different environmental clusters. The findings of the current research pointed out that the environmental variables are independent and there is a vertical distribution of the vegetation according to altitude.

Neuropsychological assessment was based on Bayley Scales of Infant Development (18 months of age), McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (4 years of age), Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices, Trail Making Test and Finger Tapping Test (6 years of age). In multivariate adjusted linear regression analyses, maternal hypothyroxinemia was associated with decreased verbal scores at 4 years and reduced motor speed at 6 years of age. Maternal thyroid autoimmunity was associated with decreased child perceptual and motor ability at 4 years of age. Four trajectories of longitudinal non-verbal cognitive development were identified and children exposed to maternal thyroid autoimmunity had increased risk for belonging to an adverse trajectory ('low': adjusted relative risk ratio (RRR) = 2.7 95% CI: (1.4, 5.2), 'high-decreasing': adjusted RRR = 2.2 95% CI: (1.2, 4.0), 'low-increasing': adjusted RRR = 1.8 95% CI: (1.0, 3.2)). Maternal hypothyroxinemia is associated with reduced offspring verbal and motor ability. Maternal thyroid autoimmunity is associated with decreased offspring perceptual performance and motor ability and increased risk for adverse non-verbal cognitive development from infancy to childhood."

Olive oil samples from three different Greek regions (Crete, Peloponnese and Lesvos) were examined by optical spectroscopy in a wide spectral region from ultraviolet to near infrared using absorption, fluorescence and Raman spectroscopies. With the aid of machine learning methods, such as multivariate partial least squares discriminant analysis, a clear classification of samples originating from the different Greek geographical regions was revealed. Moreover, samples produced in different subareas of Crete and Peloponnese were also well discriminated. Furthermore, mixtures of olive oils from different geographical origins were studied employing partial least squares as a tool to establish a model between the actual and predicted compositions of the mixtures. The results demonstrated that optical spectroscopy combined with multivariate statistical analysis can be used as an emerging innovative alternative to the classical analytical methods for the identification of the origin and authenticity of olive oils.

The concept of metamorphosis (change of form, structure, or substance) is very frequently encountered in Ancient Greek and Roman literature. One of the most striking types of metamorphosis described in many myths is gender transformation, where a man becomes a woman or vice versa. Herein, we present a case of pubertal gender inversion, the marvelous story of the Cretan Leucippus, which not only inspired many ancient writers but also led to the development of a distinct, local, religious cult. A medical interpretation of the myth, whereby we attempt to establish a diagnosis for this case of heterosexual puberty, is also provided.

"<b>Objectives:</b> To investigate the differences in distribution of intracapsular and extracapsular hip fractures among genders and age groups treated surgically. <b>Materials and methods:</b> This is a nine-year retrospective cohort study. The type of hip fractures, age, and sex-related as well as overall incidence among 2 430 patients aged over 65, surgically treated at the ""Venizeleio"" General Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, were explored and evaluated. <b>Outcomes:</b> Women suffered hip fractures 2.9 times more often than men. The majority of patients hospitalized with hip fracture were above 75 years of age (62.3% in females and 59.3% in males). The proportion of extracapsular and intracapsular fractures were 59.6% and 40.4% in men and 62.7% and 37.2% in women, respectively. Extracapsular-intertrochanteric fractures were found to increase dramatically with age in women (from 52.3% in patients younger than 75 to 58.8% in those older than 75; p-value=0.007), while in men they slightly increased with age (57.7% in patients older than 75, compared to 55.7% in those less than 75; p-value=0.62). <b>Conclusion:</b> The pattern of hip fractures was found to differ between genders and age groups in the present patients' population. Most likely, these findings reflect differences in the nature and rate of bone loss, and frequency of falling events between males and females. It has become evident that the two main hip fracture types (extracapsular and intracapsular) are distinct clinical entities. Hence, they should be addressed independently in terms of underlying causes and prevention strategies."

Telomere length (TL) represents an important marker of cellular aging. Its shortening affects human health and longevity by inducing senescence, apoptosis, and oncogenesis. Advanced ageing and negative behavioral and lifestyle factors decrease TL. The relationship between positive psycho-social factors and longer telomeres has given rise to a growing number of research efforts. Among these, religiosity poses a particular interest since it is associated with a wide range of favorable health outcomes. In this direction, recent literature reports, suggest a positive link between religiosity and TL. Underlying mechanisms for this association are not yet clarified. In this review, we would like to summarize the current knowledge on the link between religiosity and TL. Taking this opportunity, we recall findings from a cohort study in rural Crete, Greece that adds evidence on the discussion of potential psycho-social mediators which some may prevent shortening of TL.

"Cognitive impairment is known to have a significant impact on the quality of life of individuals and their caregivers, yet it is often underdiagnosed. The objective of this study is to assess the extent of cognitive impairment among elders visiting primary healthcare (PHC) practice settings, to explore associated risk factors and discuss current care challenges for PHC providers. A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2013 and May 2014. Fourteen PHC units located in rural and urban areas of the Heraklion district in Crete, Greece. Consecutive visitors aged at least 60 years attending selected PHC practices. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to indicate cognitive status. Associations of low MMSE scores (≤23/24, adjusted for education level) with 12 socio-demographic factors, comorbidities and lifestyle factors were assessed. A total of 3140 PHC patients met inclusion criteria (43.2% male; mean age 73.7±7.8 years). The average MMSE score was 26.0±3.8; 26.7±3.5 in male and 25.4±3.9 in female participants (p&lt;0.0001). Low MMSE scores were detected in 20.2% of participants; 25.9% for females vs 12.8% for males; p&lt;0.0001. Female gender (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.72; 95% CI 2.31 to 3.47), age (AOR=1.11; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.13), having received only primary or no formal education (AOR=2.87; 95% CI 2.26 to 3.65), alcohol intake (AOR=1.19; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37), reporting one or more sleep complaints (AOR 1.63; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.32), dyslipidaemia (AOR=0.80; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.98) and history of depression (AOR=1.90; 95% CI 1.43 to 2.52) were associated with low MMSE scores. This study identified a relatively high prevalence of low MMSE scores among persons attending PHC practices in a southern European community setting and associations with several known risk factors."

Despite Greece being a global hotspot of subterranean biodiversity, its hypogean fauna is largely neglected from both an ecological and conservational point of view. An overview of the Niphargidae occurring in Greece is presented as an annotated list of all available published records. These records have resulted in an updated species list reflecting taxonomic corrections and species distribution range in the Greek peninsula. A total of 23 species, attributed to 3 genera, is up to date known from Greece with a high rate of endemicity found particularly in Crete. The endemic species of Greece amount to 21 (91% of total species richness), with the remaining species distributing also in the Republic of North Macedonia. Currently, none of them is listed in the national, European or global IUCN Red Lists of Threatened Species. Considering the increasing habitat degradation due to anthropic pressure, groundwater harvesting and climate change we could lose rare and endemic species without even acknowledging their existence.

"The microbiological quality of pre-packed sandwiches, prepared by a company which had implemented the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points system, was assessed at retail level, in Crete, Greece. Totally, we analyzed 225 sandwiches (S1: ham, cheese; S2: ham, cheese, tomato; S3: tuna salad), for specific pathogens (<i>Listeria monogytenes</i>, <i>Salmonella</i> spp, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>) and hygiene indicators (<i>Escherichia coli</i>, Enterobacteriaceae, Aerobic Colony Count-ACC). Pathogens were not detected. The <i>E. coli</i> numbers enumerated in day 0 (factory level) were found within acceptable levels &lt; 100 cfu/g; limited samples had unsatisfactory values at the 3rd day of retailing storage (7%, 7%, and 27% &gt; 100 cfu/g for S1, S2, and S3, respectively), which were further increased at the 7th day (20%, 33% and 53% &gt; 100 cfu/g for S1, S2, and S3, respectively). The Enterobacteriaceae numbers mean log CFU/g were in the satisfactory or acceptable category with an increase in the range of 19.5-49.5% at the 7th day, nevertheless never exceeded the borderline of 4 log CFU/g. All ACC values were satisfactory or acceptable as no value higher than 7 log CFU/g was recorded. Overall there was a difference between the three sandwiches types, with S2 and S3, exhibiting higher levels than S1, possibly due to the extra ingredients. A number of corrective actions can be applied, as i.e. revision of cooking-chilling times, sanitizing procedures, staff hygiene practices and training etc."

"Childhood obesity is among the leading public health challenges, worldwide. To examine the association between children's adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and weight status taking into account family structure and related behaviors. 1728 primary-school Greek students (46% males), from Athens metropolitan area, island of Crete, and the Peloponnese region, were enroled during school years 2014-2016. Children and their parents completed questionnaires which, among others, recorded family structure (i.e., married/cohabited, divorced, single parent, and widowed), dietary and lifestyle habits. Adherence to the MD was assessed through the KIDMED score (range - 4 to 12). Children's body mass index was calculated and classified as normal, overweight/obese, according to the International Obesity Task Force classification. The working sample was 1142 children (44% males) with a recorded family structure. The prevalence of overweight was 21.7% and obesity was 5.0%; overweight/obesity prevalence was higher among males than females (32.4% vs. 23.3%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Overweight/obese children had a lower KIDMED score compared to normal weight (median (range): 4 (-2, 11) vs. 5 (-1, 10), <i>p</i> = 0.05). An inverse association between KIDMED score and children's weight status (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 0.95 (0.89-0.99)) was observed. Interaction between family structure and KIDMED was observed (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); stratified analysis revealed that in children from nuclear families the KIDMED score was inversely associated with the likelihood of overweight/obesity (OR (95% CI): 0.95 (0.88-1.00)), whereas in children from single-parent families it was not (OR (95% CI): 0.94 (0.79-1.12)). Adherence to the MD plays a protective role against childhood overweight/obesity, particularly among children living in nuclear families."

Feline hepatozoonosis is an emerging disease of domestic and wild felids though there is limited knowledge of this infection, e.g. regarding geographical distribution and parasite species involved. The present study evaluated microscopically and molecularly the occurrence of Hepatozoon spp. in domestic cats from insular (Crete, Mykonos and Skopelos) and continental (prefectures of Attica and Thessaloniki) Greece. Out of 282 cats examined, 72 (25.5 %) scored positive by PCR for Hepatozoon spp. and of them, 9 (12.5 %) showed gamonts on the blood smear microscopic examination. Sequences obtained from 35 of the amplicons proved the presence of two haplotypes of Hepatozoon felis. One, herein called H1 (34/35 amplicons) resulted 100 % identical with H. felis from Italy and isolates from other continents, and ∼98 % similar with a H. felis isolate causing severe clinical signs in Austria. The haplotype H2, found in a cat in Skopelos, had ∼94 % identity with H1, with H. felis isolates from Italy, Israel, Spain, a ∼92 % identity with the isolate from Austria, and ∼94-98 % with isolates from South Africa. These are the first records of H. felis in cat populations from Greece and indicate that the infection may be present at high prevalences in different regions of the country. Furthermore, the results of the molecular and phylogenetic analysis support a recent hypothesis indicating the existence of a species-complex classification for H. felis. Further studies aiming at elucidating the genetic make-up of Hepatozoon populations and possible variations in terms of geographic distribution and clinical relevance are necessary. The importance of a continuous epizootiological monitoring is crucial for the establishment of preventative and control measures protecting the health of cats living in or travelling to enzootic areas.

Meusel and A. Kástner (Asteraceae): Serving Ex Situ Conservation Needs and Its Future Sustainable Utilization as an Ornamental. 	Conservation and sustainable exploitation of threatened endemic plants with medicinal and/or horticultural/ornamental value can be achieved through the development of effective propagation protocols. After unveiling the bioclimatic preferences of <i>Carlina diae</i> (Asteraceae) with geographic information systems (GIS), four propagation trials were conducted using seeds of this endangered local Cretan endemic for in vivo and in vitro germination, as well as seasonal vegetative propagation trials (softwood cuttings) and micropropagation (nodal explants). Seed germination was accomplished at a level of 77-90% in vivo (30 days) and 96% in vitro (10 days) using an MS medium with 2.9 μM gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>). The optimum treatments for cuttings' rooting were 1000 and 2000 ppm indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) (11-16 roots, 2-3 cm long, 100% rooting) within 40 days in mist. In vitro shoot propagation exhibited a 2.8 proliferation rate after six successive subcultures on an MS medium with 2.9 μM GA<sub>3</sub>. Both <i>ex vitro</i> rooting and acclimatization were successful in 40 days, with 96% microshoot rooting and an equal survival rate. The GIS-facilitated effective species-specific propagation protocols developed in this study can consolidate the perspective of successful re-introduction of ex situ-raised material of <i>C. diae</i> into wild habitats and may serve its sustainable exploitation for high-added value ornamental products.

Dichelobacter nodosus (D. nodosus) is the etiological agent of ovine footrot affecting mainly sheep worldwide, but also free-ranging wild ungulates such as Alpine ibex (Capra ibex ibex) and mufflon (Ovis orientalis orientalis). A nationwide ovine footrot eradication program is planned for the years to come, based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-testing of interdigital swab samples and regular footbathing. In this cross-sectional study, we clinically evaluated the foot health and analysed presence of D. nodosus in 11 different even-toed ungulate species (mainly European species) during a 13 months (2018-2019) period in Berne Animal Park. The foot lesions were scored for any clinical signs of pathologies as described in cattle and simultaneously for clinical signs of footrot as described for sheep, using a scale from 0 to 5 (while 0 describes clinically healthy feet and 5 loss of the horn capsule). From a total of 53 animals, 4-feet swab samples were taken from the interdigital cleft and subjected to real-time PCR assays to detect D. nodosus at animal level. Foot lesions were detected in five different species. In 3/5 muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus wardi), 7/12 Cretan wild goats (Capra hircus cretica) and 2/3 dwarf goats (Capra hircus aegagrus), they mainly consisted of white line disease, whereas in 9/10 European bison, dermatitis of the interdigital cleft was diagnosed. 1/3 alpaca was diagnosed with chorioptic mange of the heel area. None of the examined animals showed clinical signs of footrot (score 0), and neither benign (aprB2-positive) nor virulent (aprV2-positive) D. nodosus were detected in any of the samples. This study provides additional information to facilitate an efficient ovine footrot control program in Switzerland and suggests that captive wild even-toed ungulates do not pose a risk to the planned footrot control program.

"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are commonly encountered. They are more commonly caused by Enterobacteriaceae, while antimicrobial resistance is an emerging problem in their management, with extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram-negative bacteria and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa being increasingly common. The purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and outcomes of UTIs in patients admitted in a tertiary hospital, which mostly admits geriatric patients, and compare the effects of antimicrobial resistance on patient outcomes. A retrospective observational study was conducted at a University Hospital in Crete, Greece. Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of patients with a UTI were recorded. During the 3-year period of the study, 204 UTIs were recorded. Mean age was 83.3 years and 38.7% were male. The most common isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis. Among all patients with UTI, 15.7% had an infection from ESBL, MDR, extensively drug-resistant or vancomycin-resistant enterococci pathogens. Recent antimicrobial use or hospitalization, dementia, bedridden state and sex were independently associated with mortality, while being a nursing home resident was independently associated with a higher possibility of infection from ESBL, MDR, extensively drug-resistant or vancomycin-resistant enterococci pathogens. Infection by such a resistant pathogen led to increased duration of hospitalization but not to increased mortality. Alarming antimicrobial resistance rates were noted in patients with UTIs, and this led to longer duration of hospitalization even though it did not have an impact on mortality, which was otherwise higher than in other studies.

This study summarizes published data on the sand fly fauna of Crete, the results of new sand fly samplings and the description of a new sand fly species. All published and recent samplings were carried out using CDC light traps, sticky traps or mouth aspirators. The specific status of Phlebotomus (Adlerius) creticus n. sp., was assessed by morphological analysis, cytochrome b (cytb) sequencing and MALDI-TOF protein profiling. Published data revealed the presence of 10 Phlebotomus spp. and 2 Sergentomyia spp. During presented field work, 608 specimens of 8 species of Phlebotomus and one species of Sergentomyia were collected. Both published data and present samplings revealed that the two most common and abundant species were Phlebotomus neglectus, a proven vector of Leishmania infantum causing VL, and Ph. similis, a suspected vector of L. tropica causing CL. In addition, the field surveys revealed the presence of a new species, Ph. (Adlerius) creticus n. sp. The identification of the newly described species is based on both molecular and morphological criteria, showing distinct characters of the male genitalia that differentiate it from related species of the subgenus Adlerius as well as species-specific sequence of cytb and protein spectra generated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

Various studies have investigated the effect of diet on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a complimentary treatment along with standard drug therapy. Various types of diet have been investigated. Fasting, the Mediterranean diet, the Cretan Mediterranean diet, vegetarian diet, an anti-inflammatory diet and the use of various specific food substances have been in the focus of research interest. The relationship of obesity with disease activity in RA has also been investigated. A period of fasting followed by Mediterranean diet, the Cretan Mediterranean diet and an anti-inflammatory diet have been found to have a beneficial effect on disease activity in RA. Obesity has been found to be associated with increased disease activity in RA. However, weight loss appears to be related to increased mortality in RA. The use of flavonoids, resveratrol and curcumin may have a beneficial effect in RA. It appears that diet may aid in RA management as a complimentary factor to standard drug treatment.

Landfill Gas (LFG) is a renewable energy resource. LFG quality and production rate are determined factors for the selection of the optimal technology for electric energy production. Environmental legislation, flue gas emissions, carbon footprint and maturity of technology should also be considered. The most common process for electric energy production from LFG is by Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs), which require approximately 40% minimum methane concentration. Microturbines have been also employed for electric energy production from LFG, requiring minimum methane concentration of approximately 35%. On the other hand, a relatively novel process, Gradual Oxidation (GO), can produce electric energy from LFG at methane concentrations as low as 1.5%. The present study examines the applicability of the above technologies for electric energy production from LFG, from various cells, at the landfill of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, from an economic point of view. The LandGEM (EPA) simulation model has been modified to account for the long them reduction of methane concentration in LFG, and has been adjusted, based on field measurements. The Net Present Values (NPVs) (for 15-years and 25-years from installation) for three distinct scenarios, with total electric energy production capacity of 800 kW, per scenario (using just ICEs, combination of ICE and GO or just microturbines), were calculated. The results indicated that the most profitable scenario (among the ones studied) was the one with the use of two microturbines with capacity 400 kW, each, yielding 15-years and 25-yeasr NPVs of 2.68 and 3.69 M€, respectively, for initial capital investment of 2.24 M€.

"The inherited thrombophilic mutations of the factor V gene (FVG1691A Leiden-FVL), prothrombin gene (PTG20210A), and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene C677T (MTHFR C677T) are risk factors for thromboembolic events and are related to the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of these factors in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and survival of patients with CKD-5 receiving haemodialysis. A cohort of 395 patients with CKD-5 on haemodialysis, from 6 dialysis units in Crete, Greece were recruited based on their medical records and were followed for 5 years. We collected data on CKD-5 aetiology, thrombophilic gene expression, vascular access thrombosis, time of death, and causes of death. The mutated genes just as prevalent in patients with CKD-5 as they were in a control group with no renal disease (p &gt; 0.05). FVL heterozygosity was significantly more prevalent (11.4 vs. 5.7%; p = 0.036) in patients presented with CKD of unknown aetiology, compared to CKD secondary to known aetiologies. The survival of patients with CKD-5 receiving haemodialysis was not affected by the presence of any thrombophilic mutation. This held true for the whole cohort and for the cohort that included only lethal vascular events. Most patients with MTHFR C677T heterozygosity, and all patients with MTHFR C677T homozygosity, died from vascular events during the follow-up period. The FVL mutation may act as a risk factor for CKD. This study increases our understanding of molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CKD of unknown aetiology. Τhe presence of thrombophilic mutations did not affect the overall survival of patients with CKD-5. This finding probably reflects the effect of medical care on patient outcomes."

In 2017 and 2018, a field survey was initiated on Greek olive orchards to investigate the attractiveness of bait spray applications and the impact of cover and bait sprays applied against the olive fruit fly <i>Bactrocera oleae</i> (Diptera: Tephritidae), on the honeybee, <i>Apis mellifera</i> L. and bumblebees <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, by investigating the pesticides' residual prevalence. Bee colonies were evenly distributed in three sites located on coastal areas of Western Crete and visited almost weekly between July and October. Samples collected, were analyzed using existing or developed-optimized liquid and gas chromatographic methods. In bee samples, concentrations varied from 0.0013 to 2.3 mg/kg for dimethoate, from 0.0013-0.059 mg/kg for its metabolite omethoate, and from 0.0035 to 0.63 mg/kg regarding the pyrethroids, β-cyfluthrin and λ-cyhalothrin. In one bee sample dimethoate concentration exceeded both acute oral and contact median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>). Residue findings in bees, along with verified olive oil residues corroborated that those insecticides had been applied in the olive orchards and transferred to bees. The possibility of non-target effects of the bait sprays to the bees, as well as the impact of the contaminated olive to the bees are discussed.

The importance of herbal extracts on health, which was initially based on ethnopharmacological and traditional knowledge, becomes increasingly well documented by numerous experimental and intervention studies. The daily use of beverages from different aromatic plants which becomes more popular nowadays, has been a tradition in Crete, and a habit that has been linked to the longevity seen in the island. Additionally, a certain combination of aromatic plants has been used against common cold and influenza. Interestingly, when such a mixture of essential oils from Cretan herbs (Cretan Aromatic Plants essential oil, CAPeo, from thyme, Greek sage, and Cretan dittany) was formulated, significant antiviral properties were observed in vitro and a significant reduction in the duration and severity of symptoms of patients with upper respiratory tract infections was found in a clinical study. However, since many plants extracts can exert toxic effects, toxicity issues should be properly addressed. In the present work we present an acute and sub-chronic toxicity evaluation for this mixture of aromatic plants' essential oils in rats. In fact, it is the only toxicity study for Cretan dittany. We report absence of toxicity, rendering the use of the mixture of essential oils from Cretan dittany, Greek sage and thyme as safe.

"On placental histology, placenta creta (PC) ranges from clinical placenta percreta through placenta increta and accreta (clinical and occult) to myometrial fibers with intervening decidua. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the clinicopathologic correlations of these lesions. A total of 169 recent consecutive cases with PC (group 1) were compared with 1661 cases without PC examined during the same period (group 2). The frequencies of 25 independent clinical and 40 placental phenotypes were statistically compared between the groups using chi-square test or analysis of variance where appropriate. Group 1 placentas, as compared with group 2 placentas, were statistically significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) associated with caesarean sections (11.2% vs. 7.5%), antepartum hemorrhage (17.7% vs 11.6.%), gestational hypertension (11.2% vs 4.3%), preeclampsia (11.8% vs 2.6%), complicated third stage of labor (18.9% vs 6.4%), villous infarction (14.2% vs 8.9%), chronic hypoxic patterns of placental injury, particularly the uterine pattern (14.8%, vs 9.6%), massive perivillous fibrin deposition (9.5% vs 5.3%), chorionic disc chorionic microcysts (21.9% vs 15.9%), clusters of maternal floor multinucleate trophoblasts (27.8% vs 21.2%), excessive trophoblasts of chorionic disc (24.3% vs 17.3%), segmental fetal vascular malperfusion (27.8% vs 19.9%), and fetal vascular ectasia (26.2% vs 15.2%). Because of the association of PC with gestational hypertensive diseases, acute and chronic placental hypoxic lesions, increased extravillous trophoblasts in the chorionic disc, chorionic microcysts, and maternal floor trophoblastic giant cells, PC should be regarded as a lesion of abnormal placental implantation and abnormal trophoblast invasion rather than decidual deficiency only."

"The eyeWatch™ is a novel device in glaucoma surgery aiming at the control of aqueous flow through the use of an external magnetic control unit. We propose the modification of this approach through the use of an injectable perforated tube rather than a plated valve. Procedures were performed at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University of Crete. Three blind painful eyes of three patients were included. All patients were operated under topical anesthesia. A purpose designed blunt-ended injector was used to insert intraorbitally a perforated 4 cm-long silicone tube. The tube was then connected to an eyeWatch™ device which was placed in a standard fashion along the superior-temporal quadrant of the eyeball. The procedure was uneventful in cases I and II, whereas in case III the tube had to be trimmed by 1.5 cm because of cicatricial changes in the orbit. The eyeWatch™ was left closed (position VI) at the conclusion of surgeries. Patients were examined on the 1-day, 1-week, 2-week, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month intervals and in one case on the 12-month interval. No major complications were observed. The intraocular pressure (IOP) remained under 15 mm Hg without anti-glaucomatous medications in all postoperative intervals in cases I and 2 with readjustment of eyeWatch™ at position IV. In case III, despite the change of the eyeWatch™ to the open position, the IOP remained high (40 mm Hg). The combination of the eyeWatch™ with an insertable perforated tube instead of a standard non-valved plate may prove a valid minimally invasive option. Modifications of the technique, such as an increased number and diameter of tube perforations, increased inserted tube length, perhaps aided by a sharp-ended injector, and selection of the insertion quadrant, may increase the effectiveness of the method. eyeWatch™ combined with a single tube instead of a plated valve is a feasible, quick, and minimally invasive technique that can be used in glaucoma surgery.

"<b>Objectives:</b> Many countries have implemented quarantines to control the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spread. The quarantine effects on surgically-treated fractures, operated during this period (March 9th - May 4th) in two public Greek institutions, the ""Venizeleion"" General Hospital of Crete (VGH) and the ""251"" Hellenic Air Force General Hospital of Athens (""251"" HAFGH) were evaluated and compared with those of the same period of 2019. <b>Materials and methods:</b> This is a retrospective study of a prospectively collected database. Evaluated data included gender, age, and trauma mechanism. <b>Outcomes:</b> A total of 103 patients who had suffered fractures were surgically treated in both institutions during the quarantine period of 2020 compared to 179 during the same period of 2019, showing a reduction of 43% in surgical cases. The mean age of patients treated in 2020 was 72.2 (SD=19.9), as compared to 65.3 (SD=21.5; p-value=0.008) in 2019. There were 70 (68%) elderly patients (&gt;65 years) in 2020 and 103 (57.6%) in 2019. Of all treated fractures, 31% were caused by high energy mechanisms during the explored period of 2020, as compared to 45% in 2019 (p-value=0.019). <b>Conclusions:</b> This is the first study in Europe evaluating the effect of COVID-19 quarantine on surgically treated fractures. The findings showed a significant decline in surgically treated fractures, particularly high-energy fractures, along with a significantly higher mean age of patients in 2020 compared to 2019. Low-energy fractures in elderly during quarantine emphasizes the need of prevention measures to minimize their incidence, especially in a time when the health personnel and resources are engaged in the battle against COVID-19."

Traffic incidents are one of the most frequent causes of death in young adults worldwide. Depending on the location of the incident, the velocity of the vehicle(s), the weather condition, traffic incidents are often complicated making the investigation of the circumstances difficult. Here we report a case of an incinerated body involved in a vehicle incident. Differential diagnosis included natural cause of death during driving, fatal traumatic injuries, death due to fire and positional asphyxia. The body was submitted to PMCT prior to autopsy as part of a research protocol (N. 1388/2016) at the Department of Medical Imaging of the University Hospital of Heraklion in Crete, Greece. Unenhanced PMCT revealed craniofacial fractures, a thin film of subdural haemorrhage and an epidural fluid collection. The findings were interpreted as consistent with an impact to the face, causing craniofacial fractures mainly on the right side, and an acute subdural hematoma. Autopsy findings corroborated the diagnosis. The epidural hematoma was deemed to be post-mortem heat-induced. This case is an excellent example of the diagnostic value of PMCT in the medicolegal investigation of death.

"Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridaemia, low HDL cholesterol, hyperglycaemia and hypertension. Early identification of MetS is important for preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD). MetS has not been systematically explored in Greek primary care. To examine MetS frequency among primary care patients 40 years of age or older in Crete. A descriptive study was conducted (July-December 2015). General practitioners, randomly selected from regional physician listings, recruited consecutive patients, 40 years of age or older, visiting their practice. Chart audits were completed for eligible patients using medical records, including demographics and cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus). MetS was defined using the revised NCEP ATP III criteria. Frequencies with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Gender differences were explored using Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests. Our sample consisted of 815 patients (55.7% female; mean age 65.2 years; range 40-98 years) from 44 GP practices. Overall, 73.6% (95% CI 70.4, 76.6) were identified with MetS, with a higher proportion of males (75.6%; 95% CI 71.0, 79.8) than females (72.0%; 95% CI 67.8, 76.0). Among the total sample, relatively high rates of hypertension (males: 64.5%; 95% CI 59.9, 70.0 and females: 61.1%; 95% CI 56.8, 65.8), dyslipidaemia (males: 69.3%; 95% CI 64.3, 74.1 and females: 63.5%; 95% CI 59.3, 68.0), diabetes mellitus (males: 46.9%; 95% CI 42.2, 52.4 and females: 36.5%; 95% CI 32.5, 41.6) and coronary heart disease (males: 21.2%; 95% CI 17.0, 25.2 and females: 6.2%; 95% CI 4.2, 8.6) were documented. MetS and CVD risk factors were encountered at high frequencies in the studied population of primary care patients in Crete."

"<b>Introduction:</b> Dementia severely affects the quality of life of patients and their caregivers; however, it is often not adequately addressed in the context of a primary care consultation, especially in patients with multi-morbidity. <b>Study Population and Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted between March-2013 and December-2014 among 3,140 consecutive patients aged &gt;60 years visiting 14 primary health care practices in Crete, Greece. The Mini-Mental-State-Examination [MMSE] was used to measure cognitive status using the conventional 24-point cut-off. Participants who scored low on MMSE were matched with a group of elders scoring &gt;24 points, according to age and education; both groups underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. For the diagnosis of dementia and Mild-Cognitive-Impairment (MCI), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-of-Mental-Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria and the International-Working-Group (IWG) criteria were used. Chronic conditions were categorized according to ICD-10 categories. Logistic regression was used to provide associations between chronic illnesses and cognitive impairment according to MMSE scores. Generalized Linear Model Lasso Regularization was used for feature selection in MMSE items. A two-layer artificial neural network model was used to classify participants as impaired (dementia/MCI) vs. non-impaired. <b>Results:</b> In the total sample of 3,140 participants (42.1% men; mean age 73.7 SD = 7.8 years), low MMSE scores were identified in 645 (20.5%) participants. Among participants with low MMSE scores 344 (54.1%) underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation and 185 (53.8%) were diagnosed with Mild-Cognitive-Impairment (MCI) and 118 (34.3%) with dementia. Mental and behavioral disorders (F00-F99) and diseases of the nervous system (G00-G99) increased the odds of low MMSE scores in both genders. Generalized linear model lasso regularization indicated that 7/30 MMSE questions contributed the most to the classification of patients as impaired (dementia/MCI) vs. non-impaired with a combined accuracy of 82.0%. These MMSE items were questions 5, 13, 19, 20, 22, 23, and 26 of the Greek version of MMSE assessing orientation in time, repetition, calculation, registration, and visuo-constructive ability. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study identified certain chronic illness-complexes that were associated with low MMSE scores within the context of primary care consultation. Also, our analysis indicated that seven MMSE items provide strong evidence for the presence of dementia or MCI."

"Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) ɛ4 allele increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, among patients with cognitive impairment, longer sleep duration is associated with worse cognitive performance. To date, literature examining the associations between APOE ɛ4 allele and objective sleep duration is limited. Our aim was to assess the association between APOE ɛ4 and objective sleep duration, among patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. A sub-sample of 89 patients with AD (n = 49) and MCI (n = 40) were recruited from a large, population-based cohort of 3,140 elders (&gt;60 years) residing on Crete, Greece. All participants underwent medical history/physical examination, extensive neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological evaluation, 3-day 24 h actigraphy and APOE ɛ4 allele genotyping. Comparisons of sleep duration variables between APOE ɛ4 allele carriers and non-carriers were assessed using ANCOVA, controlling for confounders. The sample included 18 APOE ɛ4 carriers and 71 non-carriers, aged 78.6±6.6 and 78.2±6.5 years, respectively. Comparisons between the APOE ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers revealed no significant differences in terms of demographic and clinical variables. In terms of objective sleep duration across the two groups, APOE ɛ4 carriers compared to non-carriers had significantly longer nighttime Total Sleep Time (nTST) (7.7±1.4 versus 7.2±1.3  h, respectively, p = 0.011), as well as 24 h TST (8.5±1.6 versus 7.8±1.5  h, respectively, p = 0.012). Among patients with MCI and AD, APOE ɛ4 carriers have longer objective nighttime and 24 h sleep duration compared to non-carriers. These findings further support that objective long sleep duration is a genetically-driven pre-clinical marker associated with worse prognosis in elderly with cognitive impairment."

"Inflammation provides a substrate for mechanisms that underlie the association of maternal diet during pregnancy with Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms in childhood. However, no previous study has quantified the proinflammatory potential of maternal diet as a risk factor for ADHD. Thus, we evaluated the association of maternal dietary inflammatory index (DII<sup>®</sup>) scores during pregnancy with ADHD symptoms in 4-year-old children born in two Mediterranean regions. We analyzed data from two population-based birth cohort studies-INMA (Environment and Childhood) four subcohorts in Spain (N = 2097), and RHEA study in Crete (Greece) (N = 444). The DII score of maternal diet was calculated based on validated food frequency questionnaires completed during pregnancy (12th and/or 32nd week of gestation). ADHD symptoms were assessed by ADHD-DSM-IV in INMA cohort and by ADHDT test in RHEA cohort, with questionnaires filled-out by teachers and parents, respectively. The associations between maternal DII and ADHD symptoms were analysed using multivariable-adjusted zero-inflated negative binomial regression models in each cohort study separately. Meta-analysis was conducted to combine data across the cohorts for fitting within one model. The DII was significantly higher in RHEA (RHEA = 2.09 [1.94, 2.24]) in comparison to INMA subcohorts (Asturias = - 1.52 [- 1.67, - 1.38]; Gipuzkoa = - 1.48 [- 1.64, - 1.33]; Sabadell = - 0.95 [- 1.07, - 0.83]; Valencia = - 0.76 [- 0.90, - 0.62]). Statistically significant reduced risk of inattention symptomatology (OR = 0.86; CI 95% = 0.77-0.96), hyperactivity symptomatology (OR = 0.82; CI 95% = 0.72-0.92) and total ADHD symptomatology (OR = 0.82; CI 95% = - 0.72 to 0.93) were observed with increased maternal DII in boys. No statistically significant associations were observed in girls between maternal DII and inattention, hyperactivity and total ADHD symptomatology. We found reduced risk of ADHD symptomatology with increased DII only in boys. This relationship requires further exploration in other settings."

Desert dust events in Mediterranean countries, originating mostly from the Sahara and Arabian deserts, have been linked to climate change and are associated with significant increase in mortality and hospital admissions from respiratory causes. The MEDEA clinical intervention study in children with asthma is funded by EU LIFE+ program to evaluate the efficacy of recommendations aiming to reduce exposure to desert dust and related health effects. This paper describes the design, methods, and challenges of the MEDEA childhood asthma study, which is performed in two highly exposed regions of the Eastern Mediterranean: Cyprus and Greece-Crete. Eligible children are recruited using screening surveys performed at primary schools and are randomized to three parallel intervention groups: a) no intervention for desert dust events, b) interventions for outdoor exposure reduction, and c) interventions for both outdoor and indoor exposure reduction. At baseline visits, participants are enrolled on MEDena® Health-Hub, which communicates, alerts and provides exposure reduction recommendations in anticipation of desert dust events. MEDEA employs novel environmental epidemiology and telemedicine methods including wearable GPS, actigraphy, health parameters sensors as well as indoor and outdoor air pollution samplers to assess study participants' compliance to recommendations, air pollutant exposures in homes and schools, and disease related clinical outcomes. The MEDEA study evaluates, for the first time, interventions aiming to reduce desert dust exposure and implement novel telemedicine methods in assessing clinical outcomes and personal compliance to recommendations. In Cyprus and Crete, during the first study period (February-May 2019), a total of 91 children participated in the trial while for the second study period (February-May 2020), another 120 children completed data collection. Recruitment for the third study period (February-May 2021) is underway. In this paper, we also present the unique challenges faced during the implementation of novel methodologies to reduce air pollution exposure in children. Engagement of families of asthmatic children, schools and local communities, is critical. Successful study completion will provide the knowledge for informed decision-making both at national and international level for mitigating the health effects of desert dust events in South-Eastern Europe.

While hypertension is an important contributor to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its treatment has well-established mortality benefits, there is uncertainty as regards the management of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). Furthermore, the association of ISH with CVD and mortality has been established, but the metabolic characteristics of the affected population have not as yet been adequately described. The aim of this study was to describe the metabolic profiles of patients with ISH. An observational study of patients attending the Hypertension Unit of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, was performed. In total, 809 hypertensive patients not on any antihypertensive treatment were identified. Among them, 44.7% were men, aged 55.6 ± 12.5 years, while 29.7% of both men and women were smokers. Systolic blood pressure was 161.3 ± 15.8 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure was 96.1 ± 11.3 mmHg. Body mass index (BMI) was 31 ± 5.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, while 9.6% had type 2 diabetes (T2D). A comparison of patients with ISH with those with hypertension, but not ISH, revealed that patients with ISH were older and had lower SBP and higher pulse pressure, while they also had lower total cholesterol and LDL and were more likely to have T2D, albeit they had a slightly lower BMI. On the other hand, they did not have any difference in terms of gender, smoking status, HDL, triglycerides, liver biochemistry, uric acid, or prevalence of impaired fasting glucose. Patients with ISH were older, with lower SBP, total cholesterol, and LDL and higher pulse pressure and higher prevalence of diabetes.

A total of 806 IBD patients were included in the study: 463 (57.4%) males, 441 (54.7%) Crohn's Disease, 352 (43.7%) ulcerative colitis and 13 (1.6%) IBD unclassified (IBD-U). Mean age was 50.67 ± 17.67 years, mean age of IBD diagnosis 36.67 ± 16.53 years and mean disease duration 13.65 ± 9.89 years. The prevalence of MCM was 171/806 (21.2%), 9.65% in ulcerative colitis and 30.84% in CD. The presence of MCM was significantly correlated with younger age of IBD diagnosis, longer IBD duration, CD diagnosis, inflammatory behavior and ileal or ileocolonic location of CD, extensive colitis in ulcerative colitis, intestinal manifestations (EIMs) and treatment with immunosuppressant or anti-TNFa. The development of MCM was independently associated with the presence of other EIMs odds ratio (OR), 4.03 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.60-6.24; P &lt; 0.001] and treatment with immunosuppressant (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 01.14-3.07; P = 0.013) or anti-TNFa (OR = 2.47; 95% CI, 1.59-3.84; P &lt; 0.01). In our study, about one-fifth of IBD patients developed MCM that was more frequently present in CD than in ulcerative colitis."

Greece is among the European countries with the highest consumption of antibiotics, both in community and hospital settings, including last-line antibiotics, such as carbapenems. We sought to explore doctors' perceptions, attitudes and practices towards the management of patients with multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections after the implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP) in a tertiary academic hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. A self-administered, internet-based questionnaire survey was completed by doctors of the University Hospital of Heraklion in Crete, Greece. In total, 202 (59.1%) hospital doctors fully completed the questionnaire. Most of them agreed that the prospective audit and feedback ASP strategy is more effective and educational than the preauthorization ASP strategy. ASP implementation prompted most respondents to monitor the continuously evolving microbiological data of their patients more closely and affected them towards a multidisciplinary and personalised care of patients with infections caused by MDROs and towards a more rigorous implementation of infection prevention and control measures. The vast majority of participants (98.5%) stated that ASP must be continued and further developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ASP implementation in our hospital had a beneficial impact on doctors' perceptions, attitudes and practices with regard to the management of infections due to MDROs.

"Drug interactions represent a major issue in clinical settings, especially for critically ill patients such as those with cardiovascular disease (CVD) who require cardiothoracic surgery (CTS) and receive a high number of different medications. A cross-sectional study aimed at evaluating the exposure and clinical significance of drug-drug (DDIs) and drug-dietary supplement interactions (DDSIs) in patients admitted for CTS in the University Hospital of Crete Greece. DDIs were evaluated regarding underlying pharmacological mechanisms upon admission, preoperation, postoperation, and discharge from CTS clinic. Additionally, upon admission, the use of dietary supplements (DSs) and if patients had informed their treating physician that they were using these were recorded with subsequent analysis of potential DDSIs with prescribed medications. The study employed 76 patients who were admitted for CTS and accepted to participate. Overall, 166 unique DDIs were identified, with 32% of them being related to pharmacokinetic (PK) processes and the rest (68%) were related to possible alterations of pharmacodynamic (PD) action. CVD medications and drugs for central nervous system disorders were the most frequently interacting medications. In total, 12% of the identified DDIs were of serious clinical significance. The frequency of PK-DDIs was higher during admission and discharge, whereas PD-DDIs were mainly recorded during pre- and postoperation periods. Regarding DS usage, 60% of patients were using DSs and perceived them as safe, and the majority had not informed their treating physician of this or sought out medical advice. Analysis of medical records showed 30 potential combinations with prescribed medications that could lead in DDSIs due to modulation of PK or PD processes, and grapefruit juice consumption was involved in 38% of them. An increased burden of DDIs and DDSIs was identified mostly upon admission for patients in CTS clinics in Greece. Healthcare providers, especially prescribing physicians in Greece, should always take into consideration the possibility of DDIs and the likely use of DS products by patients to promote their well-being; this should only be undertaken after receiving medical advice and an evidenced-based evaluation."
PMID:33621882	Kourgialas NN	Sci Total Environ. 775:145857	2021	A critical review of water resources in Greece: The key role of agricultural adaptation to climate-water effects. 	Τhe management and protection of a country's water resources is a matter of high priority, ensuring the development and socio-economic stability of a country. Unquestionably, Greece is a characteristic example of this, as water distribution is highly spatially and temporally unequally distributed, while irrigation and tourist consumers as well as the pollution load are expected to be increased in the near future. Water resources in Greece are particularly affected by climate extremes, with droughts, floods and soil erosion by water being the utmost consequences. Greece consumes the greatest amount of its available water resources in the agricultural sector. Also, there is much evidence of water shortage and bad/poor chemical status of some water bodies, mainly due to saltwater intrusion in coastal agricultural areas and intensively agricultural activities. Therefore, this review provides a literature update on the quantity and quality aspects of water resources in Greece for each water body, focusing on water relation effects (aridity/drought, floods and soil erosion by water). This paper, based on different sources of information and an extensive database of water related data, collects, evaluates and groups data from a quantity and quality point of view for all the different water bodies of Greece. Specific water districts such as the Aegean islands, the eastern part of Crete, Attica and Thessaly are expected to be the most affected by climate-water impacts with reduced crops yields, a greater risk of droughts and/or floods, a loss of agricultural land, declining water availability, and degraded water resources (surface and groundwater). Based on these findings, the proposed review highlights agricultural adaptation practices for increasing water use efficiency, ensuring the sustainability of water resources in Greece.

A recent increase in the Calocoris trivialis populations associated with premature olive blossom dropping in Crete coupled with ineffective control by organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides resulted in resistance development speculation. A stem-dip assay was developed to evaluate C. trivialis susceptibility to dimethoate and beta-cyfluthrin against nymphal and adult insect stages. Susceptibility of C. trivialis populations collected from two Cretan orchards with no (AGRK) and extensive spray history (SPL) to both insecticides was evaluated and compared. Dimethoate LC<sub>50</sub> values of the AGRK population were 17.47 and 33.37 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for adults and nymphs and 45.85 and 20.08 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for SPL respectively. C. trivialis was significantly more susceptible to beta-cyfluthrin as indicated by LC<sub>50</sub> values for AGRK, SPL adults (0.53, 0.73 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) and nypmphs (1.44, 2.21 mg L<sup>-1</sup>). No evidence for resistance development was found in any of the insecticide cases. Adult insects were significantly more sensitive than nymphs in both insecticide/population combinations. Ratios of nymph: adult LC<sub>50</sub>values were 1.91, 2.71 for dimethoate and beta-cyfluthrin in AGRK and 2.28, 3.02 in SPL population. Susceptibility data and evidence of differential stage-dependent response of C. trivialis to both insecticides should be taken account for the establishment of effective control strategies.

The botanical origin of honey attracts both commercial and research interest. Consumers' preferences and medicinal uses of particular honey types drive the demand for the determination of their authenticity with regard to their botanical origin. This study presents the discrimination of thyme, multi-floral. and honeydew honeys by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy combined with multivariate statistical analysis. UV absorption spectroscopy was applied without any dilution of the sample using a custom-made cuvette. FTIR and UV absorption spectroscopic data were processed by means of the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. The optimal classification of floral and honeydew honeys was accomplished with UV spectroscopy with a successful estimation of 92.65% for floral honey and 91.30% for honeydew honey. The discrimination of thyme versus the multi-floral honey was best achieved with FTIR, with a correct classification of 95.56% and 100% for multi-floral and thyme honey respectively. Furthermore, our findings revealed the region of 2400-4000 cm<sup>-1</sup> of the FTIR spectra as the most significant for this discrimination. This work demonstrates that optical spectroscopic techniques in combination with multivariate statistical analysis can be a rapid, low-cost, easy-to-use approach for the determination of the botanical origin of honey without sample pretreatment. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

The antioxidants found in grapes and wine have been linked to health benefits in humans, but may be affected by agronomic parameters, grape type/variety, and processing. Here, we report results of a farm survey which investigated the effects of production system (organic vs. conventional) and grape variety on fruit yield, total antioxidant activity/capacity (TAA, assessed by the Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assays), and total concentrations of total phenolics (TPC) and anthocyanins (TAC) in grapes of one red (Kotsifali) and two white (Villana and/or Vidiano) traditional Cretan grape varieties. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results showed that grape variety choice had a more substantial effect on TPC, TAA, and TAC than primary production protocols, and significant interactions were identified between production system and grape variety choice for TAA<sub>TEAC</sub>. Specifically, TAA<sub>TEAC</sub> was significantly (57%) higher in organic than conventional Vidiano grapes, while there was no significant effect of production system on TAA<sub>TEAC</sub> in Kotsifali and Villana grapes. As expected from previous studies, the TAC was substantially higher in red Kotsifali grapes. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified grape variety as the only strong explanatory variable/driver for yield, TPC, TAA, and TAC of table grapes, and positive associations were detected between the variety Vidiano and both TPC and TAA<sub>TEAC</sub>. All other explanatory variables included in the RDA (including supplementary irrigation, orchard orientation, production system, soil type, vineyard age, plant density, and fertiliser inputs) explained only a small proportion of the additional variation.
PMID:33719539	Markakis EA, Soultatos SK, Kanetis L, Goumas DE	Plant Dis.	2021	First Report of Stem Canker of Almond Trees Caused by Fusarium solani in Greece. 	"Almond (Prunus dulcis) is an important crop for Greece grown on 15.130 ha in 2019. In September 2019, a severe stem canker disease was observed in 6-year-old trees of cv Marta grafted on the rootstock 'F675C14', in a new almond grove of cvs Marta, Soleta, Antonela, Belona and Laurete, in Vlachiana, Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Only cv Marta trees were affected. Diseased trees exhibited cankers on trunks and branches with pale yellow to red-colored gum excreting from cankers, yellowing, leaf fall, twig and branch dieback, bark and wood tissue discoloration. Severely affected trees were killed. A Fusarium-like fungus was consistently isolated from symptomatic wood tissue previously surface-disinfested with 95% ethanol, on acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA). Emerging colonies were transferred to new PDA and the growth rate of the fungus was 7.86 mm/day at 24 °C in the dark. The abundant aerial mycelium was initially white, turning into pale orange in the centre after 7 days of growth on PDA. Microscopic observations revealed hyaline conidiophores measuring 26.74 ± 20.44 μm in length, developing microconidia 5.00 to 9.50 × 2.50 to 4.75 μm (average 6.64 × 3.50 μm) and macroconidia 10.00 to 23.25 × 3.75 to 5.50 μm (average 16.42 × 4.50 μm) in size. DNA from one representative single-spore isolate (code KOUB.AM.VR1) was extracted and the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of ribosomal DNA and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF 1-a) genes were amplified using the primer pairs ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and EF1-F/EF2-R (O'Donnell et al. 1998), respectively. The PCR products were sequenced and deposited in GenBank (accession Nos. MW547397 and MW554492). Based on morphological characteristics (Leslie and Summerell 2006) and a BLAST search with 100.00% and 99.38% identity to published F. solani ITS and EF 1-a sequences in GenBank (KX034335.1, DQ247636.1) the fungus was identified as F. solani. Eight 3-year-old almond trees of cv. Marta were artificially inoculated in March 2020 by making a 6.0-mm-diameter hole into the trunk, inserting a 6-mm-diameter mycelial disc taken from a 10-day-old PDA culture, sealing the hole with cellophane membrane and covering with adhesive paper tape. Another eight trees of the same cultivar were mock-inoculated with sterilized PDA discs and served as controls. Potted trees were kept under ambient conditions. One month post inoculation, yellow gum was evident excreting around the inoculation point in F. solani-treated trees but not in the controls. Seven months post inoculation, longitudinal and transverse sections of inoculated trunks revealed internal and external symptoms similar to those observed under natural infection conditions and F. solani was steadily re-isolated from symptomatic wood tissue and identified by colony morphology. Neither symptoms nor positive isolations were observed in control trunks. Pathogenicity tests were repeated twice. Fusarium solani has been reported as the causal agent of stem canker or wood decay diseases in several woody hosts including bitternut hickory, black walnut, mulberry and pistachio trees (Crespo et al. 2019; Markakis et al. 2017; Park and Juzwik 2012; Tisserat 1987). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first worldwide report of stem canker caused by F. solani on almond tree. This disease could potentially be an increasing problem in almond growing areas and result in severe crop losses. Hence, effective management practices should be investigated and applied."
PMID:33728744	Palombo MR, Zedda M	Integr Zool. 17(1):54-77	2022	The intriguing giant deer from the Bate cave (Crete): could paleohistological evidence question its taxonomy and nomenclature? 	"The research describes for the first time a possible case of pituitary gigantism in fossil mammals, precisely in deer. The pathology was detected in 2 long bones (tibia and metatarsus) belonging to an individual of an unusual large size found at the Bate cave (Rethymnon, Northern Crete). It formed the basis of Candiacervus major, the largest among the endemic deer species recorded in the Pleistocene-Early Holocene of Crete. Radiological and histomorphological examinations highlighted a reduction in cortical bone thickness and the presence of wide lacunae inside of the bone tissue. The pathological conditions suggest a pituitary gigantism diagnosis also supported by some morphological evidence, such as the extremely elongated distal part of the metatarsal diaphysis, the proportionally small proximal epiphysis, and some bone gracility. The diagnosis of a case of pituitary gigantism as presumed responsible for the extraordinary elongation of the tibia and the metatarsal bone is intriguing as they are, respectively, the paratype and the holotype of the C. major. The species represents a case of a deviation from the ""island rule"" in Pleistocene large mammals. The new evidence recommends a taxonomic and nomenclatural revision of this species. The main outcomes of this research are as follows: (i) a case of pituitary gigantism is described for the first time in an extinct mammal; (ii) it is underlined that paleohistology may provide interesting clues for disentangling taxonomic and nomenclatural issues; (iii) one of the very few cases of gigantism in insular mammals is being questioned."

"The cryptic diversity of trematodes was evaluated in the Nagayama-Shinkawa River, an artificial canal of the Ishikari River System of Hokkaido, Japan. Numerous migratory waterfowls use the canal as a stopover point in every spring season. The lymnaeid snail, Radix auricularia, and the semisulcospirid snail, Semisulcospira libertina, colonize the static and flowing water areas, respectively. The trematode fauna of the two snails was assessed by molecular phylogenetic and population genetic analyses. Each of distinctive clades in mitochondrial DNA trees was arbitrarily set as a species. In total, 14 species of the families Diplostomidae, Echinostomatidae, Notocotylidae, Plagiorchiidae, and Strigeidae occurred in R. auricularia, wherease S. libertina harbored 10 species of the families Echinochasmidae, Heterophyidae, Notocotylidae, and Lecithodendridae and Cercaria creta, an unclassified species whose adult stage is still unknown. The species diversity of the larval trematodes could be recognized as a ""hot spot"", suggesting that the seasonal visit of waterfowls is very important to spread trematodes and to keep their diversity. A high intraspecific genetic diversity was observed in the echinostomatid, notocotylid, echinochasmid, and heterophyid species, whose definitive hosts include birds. It seems likely that each of the parasite populations is always disturbed by repeated visits of waterfowls."

Co-infections with viral and bacterial enteropathogens often augment severity of diarrhoea, however, there is limited evidence on the clinical importance of bacterial enteric co-infections. We investigated the rate, type and impact of bacterial enteropathogens and their associations in children with gastroenteritis. Retrospective cohort study that included children 0-18 years old with acute bacterial diarrhoea during a 27-year period (1993-2019), in Crete, Greece. Differences in clinical characteristics and pathogen associations were investigated between single and multiple infections. Two or more bacteria were isolated in stool culture in 53 out of 1932 children (2.74%). Patients with co-infections were younger (p 0.0001) and had higher hospitalisation rates (p 0.03). Escherichia coli (E. coli) was the most prevalent pathogen associated with co-infections, in particular the E. coli enteropathogenic strains O127 and O111 (p 0.001), and Salmonella spp the least (p 0.001). Co-occurrence analysis revealed two positively associated pathogen pairs, E. coli with Campylobacter spp and E. coli (p 0.001) with Salmonella spp (p 0.04). Bacterial enteropathogen co-infection was most common with E. coli strains and related to higher hospitalisation rates and younger age.

Comorbidities and multimorbidity, often complicating the disease course of patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, may be influenced by disease-intrinsic and extrinsic determinants including regional and social factors. We analyzed the frequency and co-segregation of self-reported comorbid diseases in a community-based Mediterranean registry of patients (<i>n</i> = 399) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Predictors for multimorbidity were identified by multivariable logistic regression, strongly-associated pairs of comorbidities by the Cramer's V-statistic, and comorbidities clusters by hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Among the most prevalent comorbidities were thyroid (45.6%) and metabolic disorders (hypertension: 24.6%, dyslipidemia: 33.3%, obesity: 35.3%), followed by osteoporosis (22.3%), cardiovascular (20.8%), and allergic (20.6%) disorders. Mental comorbidities were also common, particularly depression (26.7%) and generalized anxiety disorder (10.7%). Notably, 51.0% of patients had ≥3 physical and 33.1% had ≥2 mental comorbidities, with a large fraction (<i>n</i> = 86) displaying multimorbidity from both domains. Sociodemographic (education level, marital status) and clinical (disease severity, neurological involvement) were independently associated with physical or mental comorbidity. Patients were grouped into five distinct clusters of variably prevalent comorbid diseases from different organs and domains, which correlated with SLE severity patterns. Conclusively, our results suggest a high multimorbidity burden in patients with SLE at the community, advocating for integrated care to optimize outcomes.

Olive oil is considered a valuable ingredient of human diet. It is a good source of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as other bioactive compounds, especially polyphenols. The composition of olive oil depends mainly on the variety of plant, cultivation practices, and manufacturing conditions. Traditional processing methods may ensure better quality and health benefits. Therefore, the aim of the study was the evaluation of antioxidant properties and fatty acid profile of Cretan extra virgin bioolive oils. These ones were compared with commercial Spanish, Italian, and Greek extra virgin olive oils. Obtained results showed that sample Cretan 1 had about 15% higher antioxidant capacity and about 60% higher total polyphenol content than commercial counterparts. This one had also a favorable profile of fatty acids, especially 20% more linoleic acid. We concluded that traditional production methods, using millstones, cold pressing, and without centrifugation and filtration ensure better olive oil quality and related health benefits.

The introduction and establishment of exotic species often result in significant changes in recipient communities and their associated ecosystem services. However, usually the magnitude and direction of the changes are difficult to quantify because there is no pre-introduction data. Specifically, little is known about the effect of marine exotic macrophytes on organic carbon sequestration and storage. Here, we combine dating sediment cores (<sup>210</sup> Pb) with sediment eDNA fingerprinting to reconstruct the chronology of pre- and post-arrival of the Red Sea seagrass Halophila stipulacea spreading into the Eastern Mediterranean native seagrass meadows. We then compare sediment organic carbon storage and burial rates before and after the arrival of H. stipulacea and between exotic (H. stipulacea) and native (C. nodosa and P. oceanica) meadows since the time of arrival following a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) approach. This analysis revealed that H. stipulacea arrived at the areas of study in Limassol (Cyprus) and West Crete (Greece) in the 1930s and 1970s, respectively. Average sediment organic carbon after the arrival of H. stipulacea to the sites increased in the exotic meadows twofold, from 8.4 ± 2.5 g C<sub>org</sub>  m<sup>-2 </sup> year<sup>-1</sup> to 14.7 ± 3.6 g C<sub>org</sub>  m<sup>-2 </sup> year<sup>-1</sup> , and, since then, burial rates in the exotic seagrass meadows were higher than in native ones of Cymodocea nodosa and Posidonia oceanica. Carbon isotopic data indicated a 50% increase of the seagrass contribution to the total sediment C<sub>org</sub> pool since the arrival of H. stipulacea. Our results demonstrate that the invasion of H. stipulacea may play an important role in maintaining the blue carbon sink capacity in the future warmer Mediterranean Sea, by developing new carbon sinks in bare sediments and colonizing areas previously occupied by the colder thermal affinity P. oceanica.

"There is limited knowledge on the physiological and behavioral pathways that may affect the developmental outcomes of preterm infants and particularly on the link between autonomic nervous system maturation and early social human behavior. Thus, this study attempts to investigate the way heart rate variability (HRV) parameters are related to emotional coordination in interactions of preterm and full-term infants with their parents in the first year of life and the possible correlation with the developmental outcomes of infants at 18 months. The first objective is to investigate the relationship between emotional coordination and HRV in dyadic full-term infant-parent (group 1) and preterm infant-parent (group 2) interactions during the first postpartum year. The second objective is to examine the relationship of emotional coordination and HRV in groups 1 and 2 in the first postpartum year with the developmental outcomes of infants at 18 months. The third objective is to investigate the effect of maternal and paternal postnatal depression on the relation between emotional coordination and HRV in the two groups and on developmental outcomes at 18 months. The fourth objective is to examine the effect of family cohesion and coping on the relation between emotional coordination and HRV in the two groups and on developmental outcomes at 18 months. This is an observational, naturalistic, and longitudinal study applying a mixed method design that includes the following: (1) video recordings of mother-infant and father-infant interactions at the hospital, in the neonatal period, and at home at 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months of the infants' life; (2) self-report questionnaires of parents on depressive symptoms, family cohesion, and dyadic coping of stress; (3) infants' HRV parameters in the neonatal period and at each of the above age points during and after infant-parent video recordings; and (4) assessment of toddlers' social and cognitive development at 18 months through an observational instrument. The study protocol has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Crete (number/date: 170/September 18, 2020). This work is supported by the Special Account for Research Funds of the University of Crete (grant number: 10792-668/08.02.2021). All mothers (with their partners) of full-term and preterm infants who give birth between March 2021 and January 2022 at the General University Hospital of Crete (northern Crete, Greece) will be invited to participate. The researcher will invite the parents of infants to participate in the study 1 to 2 days after birth. Data collection is expected to be completed by March 2023, and the first results will be published by the end of 2023. Investigating the regulatory role of HRV and social reciprocity in preterm infants may have implications for both medicine and psychology. PRR1-10.2196/28089."

"The ""International Research Experience for Students (IRES)"" at Doane University (DU) located in Crete, Nebraska, exposed undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students to international research at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. The international collaboration team included three undergraduate researchers per year from DU, one faculty member and one postdoctoral fellow from DU, two faculty mentors at KIT, and several graduate, post-doctoral, and technical staff at KIT. Prior to departure to Germany, the students received extensive research training, as well as culture and language preparation from the mentors at DU. While in Germany, the students received an in-depth orientation to Karlsruhe, Germany, Europe, the research setting at KIT, and the international collaborators. The eight week summer projects over three years involved nanolithography, nano- to microsized array fabrication, organic synthesis using click chemistry, and surface modifications for sensing and other biomedical research applications. When the students returned from Germany, they continued to conduct research at DU and train other undergraduate students using the expertise acquired from KIT. The DU research students, including the IRES scholars, learned oral and written communication skills. They presented their KIT and DU research results at weekly seminars and at local and national meetings. An external assessment firm evaluated the program, the students, and mentors on a yearly basis before and after the summer research. This enabled all participants to continuously improve the learning objectives and the program execution including three program adjustments implemented in year 2 or 3. The survey data shows that the IRES program provided an enriching experience for the students in research and international culture and established a successful base of collaboration for mentors."

Strong motion sensor networks deployed in metropolitan areas are able to provide valuable information for civil protection Decision Support Systems (DSSs) aiming to mitigate seismic risk and earthquake social-economic impact. To this direction, such a network is installed and real-time operated in Chania (Crete Island, Greece), city located in the vicinity of the seismically active south front of the Hellenic Subduction Zone. A blend of both traditional and advanced analysis techniques and interpretation methods of strong ground motion data are presented, studying indicative cases of Chania shaking due to earthquakes in the last couple years. The orientation independent spectral acceleration as well as the spatial distribution of the strong ground motion parameters such as the Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), Peak Ground Velocity (PGV), Peak Ground Displacement (PGD) and Arias Ιntensity observed at the urban area of Chania are presented with the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. The results point to the importance of the strong ground motion networks as they can provide valuable information on earthquake hazards prior to and after detrimental seismic events to feed rapid systems supporting civil protection decisions for prevention and emergency response.

CRISPR-Cas systems provide RNA-guided adaptive immunity in prokaryotes. We report that the multisubunit CRISPR effector Cascade transcriptionally regulates a toxin-antitoxin RNA pair, CreTA. CreT (Cascade-repressed toxin) is a bacteriostatic RNA that sequesters the rare arginine tRNA<sup>UCU</sup> (transfer RNA with anticodon UCU). CreA is a CRISPR RNA-resembling antitoxin RNA, which requires Cas6 for maturation. The partial complementarity between CreA and the <i>creT</i> promoter directs Cascade to repress toxin transcription. Thus, CreA becomes antitoxic only in the presence of Cascade. In CreTA-deleted cells, <i>cascade</i> genes become susceptible to disruption by transposable elements. We uncover several CreTA analogs associated with diverse archaeal and bacterial CRISPR-<i>cas</i> loci. Thus, toxin-antitoxin RNA pairs can safeguard CRISPR immunity by making cells addicted to CRISPR-Cas, which highlights the multifunctionality of Cas proteins and the intricate mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas regulation.
PMID:33934638	Beris D, Malandraki I, Kektsidou O, Varveri C	Plant Dis.	2021	First report of eggplant mottled crinkle virus infecting eggplant in Greece. 	During winter 2020-2021, a severe virus-like disease outbreak was observed in eggplant (<i>Solanum melongena</i> L.) hybrids 'Monarca' (F1) and 'Angela' (F1) growing under protected conditions in Heraklion, Crete, Greece. In three greenhouses, the percentage of infected plants reached 100% leading to crop abandonment. Symptoms included leaf mottling and yellowing accompanied with plant stunting and apical necrosis. Extensive fruit damage was due to severe malformation and necrotic lesions on the calyx, peduncle and the endocarp (Sup. Fig. 1). To identify the causal agent, total RNA was extracted from a symptomatic eggplant fruit with PureLink™ RNA Mini Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), which was subjected to high throughput sequencing (HTS) analysis (Illumina Inc., USA). The <i>de novo</i> assembly of the obtained 25 million, 75 bp, single-end reads with Geneious Prime (Biomatters, New Zealand) and the annotation of the resulting contigs with BLASTn revealed the presence of only eggplant mottled crinkle virus (EMCV, genus <i>Tombusvirus</i>) in the sample. The assembled sequence of EMCV isolate from Greece (EMCV-Gr, GenBank Acc. No. MW716271) was 4764 bp in length, covering the full genome of the virus and showing 96.3 % nucleotide (nt) identity with an isolate identified from calla lilies (<i>Zantedeschia</i> sp.) in Taiwan (AM711119). Five symptomatic and seven asymptomatic 'Monarca' (F1) eggplants, as well as two symptomatic 'Angela' (F1) eggplants were tested by RT-PCR that targeted the capsid protein gene of the virus (Dombrovsky et al., 2009). PCR products of 1184 bp were obtained from the seven symptomatic samples and their Sanger sequencing revealed 100 % nt identity with the respective HTS-derived EMCV sequence. No product was obtained from the analysis of the asymptomatic samples. Mechanical sap transmission of the HTS analysed eggplant sample resulted in necrotic local lesions on <i>Nicotiana rustica</i> and <i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>, necrotic local lesions plus systemic necrosis on <i>N. tabacum</i> cv. Xanthi-nc, cv. Samsun and <i>N. glutinosa</i>, systemic collapse of <i>N. benthamiana</i>, and leaf mottling plus stunting of pepper cv. Yolo Wonder plants (Sup. Fig. 1I). Although no symptoms were observed on tomato plants cv. Ace 55, systemic EMCV infection was detected by RT-PCR. To establish the relationship between the disease and EMCV, infected tissue from <i>N. benthamiana</i> plants was used for the mechanical inoculation of virus-tested negative eggplant seedlings cv. Black beauty. Necrotic spots, shoot necrosis, leaf mottling and mosaic, symptoms were observed (Sup. Fig. J) on the test plants ten days post inoculation and the presence of the virus was confirmed by RT-PCR as described. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of EMCV infecting eggplant in Greece. The virus was originally described in eggplant in Lebanon (Makkouk et al., 1981) and it is mainly present outside the European Union (EU) territory, including India, Japan, Taiwan, Iran and Israel (Dombrovsky et al., 2009 and references therein). A latent EMCV infection was detected in pear in Italy (Russo et al., 2002) and the virus is considered by the European Food Safety Authority as an exotic virus of the genera <i>Cydonia</i>, <i>Malus</i>, and <i>Pyrus</i> that meets all the criteria to qualify as an EU quarantine pest (Bragard et al., 2019). Τhe severity of the disease observed in Crete leading to the destruction of eggplant greenhouse cultivations, constitutes EMCV as an emerging threat to eggplant and other solanaceous crops for Greece and Europe.

Seven date palm seeds (<i>Phoenix dactylifera</i> L.), radiocarbon dated from the fourth century BCE to the second century CE, were recovered from archaeological sites in the Southern Levant and germinated to yield viable plants. We conducted whole-genome sequencing of these germinated ancient samples and used single-nucleotide polymorphism data to examine the genetics of these previously extinct Judean date palms. We find that the oldest seeds from the fourth to first century BCE are related to modern West Asian date varieties, but later material from the second century BCE to second century CE showed increasing genetic affinities to present-day North African date palms. Population genomic analysis reveals that by ∼2,400 to 2,000 y ago, the <i>P. dactylifera</i> gene pool in the Eastern Mediterranean already contained introgressed segments from the Cretan palm <i>Phoenix theophrasti</i>, a crucial genetic feature of the modern North African date palm populations. The <i>P. theophrasti</i> introgression fraction content is generally higher in the later samples, while introgression tracts are longer in these ancient germinated date palms compared to modern North African varieties. These results provide insights into crop evolution arising from an analysis of plants originating from ancient germinated seeds and demonstrate what can be accomplished with the application of a resurrection genomics approach.

Facial reconstruction is employed in medical science and archaeology. Though quite popular as anthropological method, it has not so far been used in the orthodox ecclesiastical tradition. This work presents the facial reconstruction of St Eftychios of Crete, who lived between the ninth and tenth centuries. Computed tomography and reverse engineering methods were employed to complete the task. Reconstruction of the mandible and the missing left zygomatic arch was implemented following the Sassouni method. The American method was followed for the soft tissues, with clay deposition of appropriate thickness, on the surface of the skull model. The eyes, nose, and lips were added based on the dimensions of the underlying bone structures. Long hair and beard were added, according to the classic Byzantine tradition pattern of the time period. The final bust developed was then digitized, using a 3D non-contact laser scanner. The 3D geometry produced was employed to produce a mold with vacuum casting techniques. This mold provides the ability to produce copies of the bust, if needed. At the same time, a realistic 3D representation of the Saint's bust was developed, with the aid of special software, in order to compare the traditional forensic reconstruction to the pure digital one. This work is the first case of a Saint's facial reconstruction in the Orthodox Church. The facial reconstruction process, with all the limitations considered, offers the ability to present a realistic aspect of a Greek Orthodox Church Saint, in a form that is easily accessible. Both physical and digital facial reconstruction processes were based on scientific data, so they were as accurate as possible, considering that the mandible was missing in the skull. The facial reconstruction was entirely implemented in Greece creating the basis for similar work in the future. The final bust developed was donated to the Odigitria Monastery, to be exhibited to its visitors.

The wide availability of satellite data from many distributors in different domains of science has provided the opportunity for the development of new and improved methodologies to aid the analysis of environmental problems and to support more reliable estimations and forecasts. Moreover, the rapid development of specialized technologies in satellite instruments provides the opportunity to obtain a wide spectrum of various measurements. The purpose of this research is to use publicly available remote sensing product data computed from geostationary, polar and near-polar satellites and radar to improve space-time modeling and prediction of precipitation on Crete island in Greece. The proposed space-time kriging method carries out the fusion of remote sensing data with data from ground stations that monitor precipitation during the hydrological period 2009/10-2017/18. Precipitation observations are useful for water resources, flood and drought management studies. However, monitoring stations are usually sparse in regions with complex terrain, are clustered in valleys, and often have missing data. Satellite precipitation data are an attractive alternative to observations. The fusion of the datasets in terms of the space-time residual kriging method exploits the auxiliary satellite information and aids in the accurate and reliable estimation of precipitation rates at ungauged locations. In addition, it represents an alternative option for the improved modeling of precipitation variations in space and time. The obtained results were compared with the outcomes of similar works in the study area.

"The mortality of patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM) remains substantial. We evaluated gene expression levels of myocardin, an early cardiac gene, in the peripheral blood cells of NIDCM patients as a prognostic biomarker in their long-term outcome and mortality from congestive HF (CHF). We retrospectively analyzed 101 consecutives optimally treated NIDCM patients of Cretan origin who were enrolled from the HF clinic of our hospital from November 2005 to December 2008. Our patient data were either taken from their medical files or recorded during visits to the HF unit or hospitalizations. Follow-up was carried out by telephone interview and by accessing information from general practitioners and cardiologists in private practice. The median follow-up period was 8 years (mean follow-up 7 ± 3.4 years). The overall mortality during follow-up was 61.4%, while mortality due to congestive heart failure (CHF) was 49.5%. Higher CHF and all-cause mortality were observed in patients with myocardin levels &lt; 14.26 (p &lt; 0.001 for both CHF and all-cause mortality). A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that myocardin level of expression had independent significant prognostic value for the risk of death from CHF (HR 14.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3-39) in those patients. Peripheral blood cells gene expression of myocardin, an early myocardial marker, may serve as prognostic biomarkers of the long-term outcome of patients with NIDCM. Our findings open new prospects in the risk stratification of these patients."

The aim of the present study is to quantify hydrogen peroxide, generated from various types of honey produced in Crete, as a potent antimicrobial agent, and establish any correlation with their physicochemical parameters. The basic physicochemical parameters (diastase activity, HMF content, moisture, electrical conductivity, color, and sugars) of 30 authentic honey samples were determined. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide in all samples was found to be within the range 0.010-0.092 mM. The known correlation between the electrical conductivity and the color of honey was confirmed in this study. Univariate and multivariate statistics applied to the results indicate that the results can be used to discriminate honey sample groups of different botanical origins.

"In November 2019, a severe outbreak of fruit rot was observed in olive orchards in Crete, southern Greece. Symptoms appeared primarily on fruits and stalks, resembling those caused by anthracnose. Typical symptoms were fruit rot, shrinkage, and mummification, associated commonly with stalk discoloration and fruit drop. Disease incidence was estimated at up to 100% in some cases, and an unprecedented increase in olive oil acidity reaching up to 8% (percentage of oleic acid) in severely affected olive groves was recorded. Thirty-two olive groves were then surveyed, and samples of fruit, stalk, leaf, and shoot were collected. Visual, stereoscopic, and microscopic observations revealed several fungi belonging to the genera <i>Alternaria</i>, <i>Botryosphaeria</i>, <i>Capnodium</i>, <i>Colletotrichum</i>, <i>Fusarium,</i> and <i>Pseudocercospora</i>. Fungal infection in fruits was commonly associated with concomitant infestation by the olive fruit fly <i>Bactrocera oleae</i> along with increased air temperature and relative humidity conditions that prevailed in October and November 2019. Twenty representative fungal strains isolated from symptomatic fruits and stalks were characterized by morphological, physiological, and molecular analyses. By internal transcribed spacer regions of ribosomal DNA region and translation elongation factor 1-α gene sequencing analysis, these isolates were identified as <i>Alternaria</i> spp., <i>A. infectoria</i>, <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i>, <i>Colletotrichum boninense sensu lato</i>, <i>Fusarium lateritium</i>, <i>F. solani</i> species complex and <i>Stemphylium amaranthi</i>. Pathogenicity tests on punctured fruits revealed that all isolates were pathogenic; however, <i>F. solani</i> isolates along with <i>B. dothidea</i> were the most virulent, and wounds were necessary for efficient fungal infection. Moreover, as few as 10 spores of <i>F. solani</i> were sufficient to cause significant infection in punctured fruits. <i>F. solani</i> was also capable of infecting olive fruits in the presence of <i>B. oleae</i>, with no additional wounding, in artificial inoculation experiments. Moreover, it was capable of colonizing and affecting olive blossoms. Further analyses of olive oil extracted from fruits artificially inoculated with <i>F. solani</i> indicated a significant increase in oil acidity, K<sub>232</sub>, K<sub>270</sub>, and peroxide value, whereas total phenol content was significantly decreased. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>F. solani</i> associated with olive fruit rot and olive oil degradation worldwide."

RTX could be an effective and safe alternative treatment for refractory EF. Rituximab (RTX) is a successful therapeutic option for various autoimmune diseases. Our aim is to report our experience with RTX in eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) and review published data on its efficacy for the treatment of EF. We reviewed the medical charts of all patients with a diagnosis of EF treated with RTX from 2008 to 2020 in the Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology in the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. We also reviewed the English literature for cases of EF treated with RTX. Demographics, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, prior treatments, response to RTX, cumulative RTX dose, duration of treatment and follow-up are reported. We report three cases of EF refractory to conventional DMARDs (cDMARDs) that responded to RTX. Furthermore, literature review revealed five cases. In our case series in all patients, RTX was the first biologic. RTX could be effective in cases of (EF) refractory to standard immunosuppressive treatment.

Bee bread is the only fermented product of the beehive. It constitutes the main source of proteins, lipids, vitamins, and macro- and microelements in honeybee nutrition and it exerts antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, though research on these aspects has been limited so far. In this study 18 samples of Greek bee bread, two of which were monofloral, were collected during different seasons from diverse locations such as Crete and Mount Athos and were tested for their bioactivity. Samples were analyzed for their antibacterial properties, antioxidant activity, total phenolic content (TPC), and total flavonoid content (TFC). The antimicrobial activity of each sample was tested against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. Our data demonstrate that all samples exert inhibitory and most of them bactericidal activity against at least two pathogens. Furthermore, all samples exert significant antioxidant activity, where the monofloral <i>Castanea Sativa</i> sample demonstrated superior antioxidant activity. Nevertheless, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity were not strongly correlated. Furthermore, machine learning methods demonstrated that the palynological composition of the samples is a good predictor of their TPC and ABTS activity. This is the first study that focuses on the biological properties of Greek bee bread and demonstrates that bee bread can be considered a functional food and a possible source of novel antimicrobial compounds.
PMID:34121645	Delarue J	Br J Nutr. 1-14	2021	Mediterranean Diet and cardiovascular health: an historical perspective. 	The first investigation of dietary intake in the Mediterranean region was undertaken at the initiative of the government of Greece in 1948. Plant foods (cereals, pulses, nuts, potatoes, vegetables and fruits) accounted for 61 % of total energy intake (TEI), animal foods (meat, eggs, fish and dairy products) for 7 % of TEI and olive oil was the main oil used. In 1950s, Ancel Keys undertook studies in USA, Italy, Spain, England, Japan, Australia and Canada leading him to hypothesise that a link could exist between diet, plasma cholesterol and CHD. Between 1958 and 1964, Keys and co-workers carried out the Seven Countries Study, which enrolled men aged 40-59 years in one of sixteen cohorts from seven countries (Finland, Greece, Italy, Yugoslavia, Japan, USA and Italy). After 15-, 25- and 50-year follow-up, a strong positive relation was observed between saturated fat intake and CHD mortality, and a negative one with Mediterranean Dietary Index. In 1975, Keys and his wife published a book entitled: 'How to eat well and stay well. The Mediterranean way', which popularised Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet). After 45-year follow-up, longevity without CHD death was 12·9 years higher in Crete than in Finland. Protecting effect of MedDiet towards CHD incidence and risk is now confirmed by Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea study and by cohorts' studies gathered in several recent meta-analyses. MedDiet is sustainable and recognised by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage, which is the most beautiful homage that can be paid to Ancel Keys and all his co-workers.

To describe the key clinical and histopathological characteristics of a large series of hidrocystomas in Greece to improve diagnostic accuracy, and to perform a historical review of the medical term hidrocystoma. A case series of 22 hidrocystomas from 20 consecutive patients treated with surgery at University Hospital of Heraklion in Crete, Greece, from January 1, 1998 to January 1, 2020 was performed along with a comprehensive historical literature review of the term hidrocystoma and its corresponding term hydatis from ancient Greek literature to the present. Data were obtained from medical records. All patients had a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of hidrocystoma. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections of 22 tumors of the 20 consecutive patients were retrieved from the pathology laboratory archive and stained for SMA, p63, and GCDFP-15 with immunochemistry and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) histochemical stain. Overall, 22 hidrocystomas (11 apocrine and 11 eccrine hidrocystomas) surgically excised from 20 patients were included in this study. Of the 20 patients, 10 (50%) were male and 10 (50%) were female, with a mean age of 56 ± 15 years. Hidrocystomas commonly occurred on the eyelids (73%), inner canthus (9%), eyebrow (4.5%), neck (4.5%), nose (4.5%), and ear (4.5%). All apocrine hidrocystomas stained positive for SMA, GCDFP-15, CAM 5.2, PAS, and PAS-D. No recurrence was observed. Here we have presented the clinicopathological characteristics of the largest case series of hidrocystomas in Europe and the Mediterranean region. Only apocrine hidrocystomas stained positive for SMA, GCDFP-15, CAM 5.2, PAS, and PAS-D.

"Delimiting species in radiations is notoriously difficult because of the small differences between the incipient species, the star-like tree with short branches between species, incomplete lineage sorting, and the possibility of introgression between several of the incipient species. Next-generation sequencing data may help to overcome some of these problems. We evaluated methods for species delimitation based on genome-wide markers in a land snail radiation on Crete. Species delimitation in the Albinaria cretensis group was based exclusively on shell characters until now and resulted in classifications distinguishing 3-9 species. We generated sequences of 4270 loci for 140 specimens of the A. cretensis group from 48 populations by double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing. We evaluated three methods for species discovery. The multispecies coalescent approach implemented in the program Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography resulted in a drastic overestimating of the number of species, whereas Gaussian clustering resulted in an overlumping. Primary species hypotheses based on the maximum percentage of the genome of the individuals derived from ancestral populations as estimated with the program ADMIXTURE moderately overestimated the number of species, but this was the only approach that provided information about gene flow between groups. Two of the methods for species validation that we applied, BFD* and delimitR, resulted in an acceptance of almost all primary species hypotheses, even such based on arbitrary subdivisions of hypotheses based on ADMIXTURE. In contrast, secondary species hypotheses, resulting from an evaluation of primary species hypotheses based on ADMIXTURE with isolation by distance tests, approached the morphological classification, but also uncovered two cryptic species and indicated that some of the previously delimited units should be combined. Thus, we recommend this combination of approaches that provided more detailed insights in the distinctness of barriers between the taxa of a species complex and the spatial distribution of admixture between them than the other methods. The recognition and delimitation of undersampled species remained a major challenge.

The date palm, Phoenix dactylifera, has been a cornerstone of Middle Eastern and North African agriculture for millennia. It was first domesticated in the Persian Gulf, and its evolution appears to have been influenced by gene flow from two wild relatives, P. theophrasti, currently restricted to Crete and Turkey, and P. sylvestris, widespread from Bangladesh to the West Himalayas. Genomes of ancient date palm seeds show that gene flow from P. theophrasti to P. dactylifera may have occurred by ∼2,200 years ago, but traces of P. sylvestris could not be detected. We here integrate archeogenomics of a ∼2,100-year-old P. dactylifera leaf from Saqqara (Egypt), molecular-clock dating, and coalescence approaches with population genomic tests, to probe the hybridization between the date palm and its two closest relatives and provide minimum and maximum timestamps for its reticulated evolution. The Saqqara date palm shares a close genetic affinity with North African date palm populations, and we find clear genomic admixture from both P. theophrasti, and P. sylvestris, indicating that both had contributed to the date palm genome by 2,100 years ago. Molecular-clocks placed the divergence of P. theophrasti from P. dactylifera/P. sylvestris and that of P. dactylifera from P. sylvestris in the Upper Miocene, but strongly supported, conflicting topologies point to older gene flow between P. theophrasti and P. dactylifera, and P. sylvestris and P. dactylifera. Our work highlights the ancient hybrid origin of the date palms, and prompts the investigation of the functional significance of genetic material introgressed from both close relatives, which in turn could prove useful for modern date palm breeding.

"Standardized ultrasound imaging and pathology protocols have recently been developed for the perinatal diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the effectiveness of these standardized protocols in the prenatal diagnosis and postnatal examination of women presenting with a low-lying placenta or placenta previa and a history of multiple Cesarean deliveries (CDs). This was a prospective cohort study of 84 consecutive women with a history of two or more prior CDs presenting with a singleton pregnancy and low-lying placenta/placenta previa at 32-37 weeks' gestation, who were referred for perinatal care and management between 15 January 2019 and 15 December 2020. All women were investigated using the standardized description of ultrasound signs of PAS proposed by the European Working Group on abnormally invasive placenta. In all cases, the ultrasound features were compared with intraoperative and histopathological findings. Areas of abnormal placental attachment were identified during the immediate postoperative gross examination and sampled for histological examination. The data of a subgroup of 32 women diagnosed antenatally as non-PAS who had complete placental separation at birth were compared with those of 39 cases diagnosed antenatally as having PAS disorder that was confirmed by histopathology at delivery. Of the 84 women included in the study, 42 (50.0%) were diagnosed prenatally as PAS and the remaining 42 (50.0%) as non-PAS on ultrasound examination. Intraoperatively, 66 (78.6%) women presented with a large or extended area of dehiscence and 52 (61.9%) with a dense tangled bed of vessels or multiple vessels running laterally and craniocaudally in the uterine serosa. A loss of clear zone was recorded on grayscale ultrasound imaging in all 84 cases, while there was no case with bladder-wall interruption or with a focal exophytic mass. Myometrial thinning (&lt; 1 mm) in at least one area of the anterior uterine wall was found in 41 (97.6%) of the 42 cases diagnosed as non-PAS on ultrasound and 37 (88.1%) of the 42 diagnosed antenatally as PAS. Histological samples were available for all 48 hysterectomy specimens with abnormal placental attachment and for the three cases managed conservatively with focal myometrial resection and uterine reconstruction. Villous tissue was found directly attached to the superficial myometrium (placenta creta) in six of these cases and both creta villous tissue and deeply implanted villous tissue within the uterine wall (placenta increta) were found in the remaining 45 cases. There was no evidence of percreta placentation on histology in any of the PAS cases. Comparison of the main antenatal ultrasound signs and perioperative macroscopic findings between the two subgroups correctly diagnosed antenatally (32 non-PAS and 39 PAS) showed no significant difference with respect to the distribution of myometrial thinning and the presence of a placental bulge on ultrasound and of anterior uterine wall dehiscence intraoperatively. Compared with the non-PAS subgroup, the PAS subgroup showed significantly higher placental lacunae grade (P &lt; 0.001) and more often hypervascularity of the uterovesical/subplacental area (P &lt; 0.001), presence of bridging vessels (P = 0.027) and presence of lacunae feeder vessels (P &lt; 0.001) on ultrasound examination, and increased vascularization of the anterior uterine wall intraoperatively (P &lt; 0.001). Remodeling of the lower uterine segment following CD scarring leads to structural abnormalities of the uterine contour on both ultrasound examination and intraoperatively, independently of the presence of accreta villous tissue on microscopic examination. These anatomical changes are often reported as diagnostic of placenta percreta, including cases with no histological evidence of PAS. Guided histological examination could improve the overall diagnosis of PAS and is essential to obtain evidence-based epidemiologic data. © 2021 The Authors.

"(1) Background: In an area with a high prevalence of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB), we investigated the colonization of nursing home residents by such organisms. (2) Methods: A point prevalence study was performed in six nursing homes of the Heraklion area on the island of Crete. A rectal swab was taken and cultured from each participant, while additional risk factors such as recent hospitalization or antimicrobial usage were recorded and evaluated. (3) Results: A total of 137 nursing home residents were included in the study. Their mean age was 82.1 years and 19.7% were males. In total, cultures yielded 255 GNB; <i>E. coli</i>, <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> were the most common. Among the microorganisms cultured, 17.6% had the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, while 18% were MDR. A statistically significant association was found between recent antimicrobial use and colonization by MDR-GNB; (4) Conclusions: Colonization by MDR-GNB was found to be highly prevalent in nursing home residents. Recent antimicrobial use was associated with MDR-GNB carriage."

"Primary gypsum deposits, which accumulated in the Mediterranean Basin during the so-called Messinian salinity crisis (5.97-5.33 Ma), represent an excellent archive of microbial life. We investigated the molecular fossil inventory and the corresponding compound-specific δ<sup>13</sup> C values of bottom-grown gypsum formed during the first stage of the crisis in four marginal basins across the Mediterranean (Nijar, Spain; Vena del Gesso, Italy; Heraklion, Crete; and Psematismenos, Cyprus). All studied gypsum samples contain intricate networks of filamentous microfossils, whose phylogenetic affiliation has been debated for a long time. Petrographic analysis, molecular fossil inventories (hydrocarbons, alcohols, and carboxylic acids), and carbon stable isotope patterns suggest that the mazes of filamentous fossils represent benthic microbial assemblages dominated by chemotrophic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria; in some of the samples, the body fossils are accompanied by lipids produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Abundant isoprenoid alcohols including diphytanyl glycerol diethers (DGDs) and glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), typified by highly variable carbon stable isotope composition with δ<sup>13</sup> C values spanning from -40 to -14‰, reveal the presence of planktic and benthic archaeal communities dwelling in Messinian paleoenvironments. The compound inventory of archaeal lipids indicates the existence of a stratified water column, with a normal marine to diluted upper water column and more saline deeper waters. This study documents the lipid biomarker inventory of microbial life preserved in ancient gypsum deposits, helping to reconstruct the widely debated conditions under which Messinian gypsum formed."

Deep brain stimulation (DBS), levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) and subcutaneous apomorphine infusion are device-aided therapies (DATs) for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). We present a case series from the Cretan PD Registry who required 2 DATs for optimal management along with a systematic review of similar studies. From 2009 to 2020, we retrospectively studied all PD patients who were simultaneously treated with 2 DATs. Six patients on DBS required an infusion treatment for persisting or re-emergent fluctuations because of disease progression. Two patients on LCIG infusion received DBS as a levodopa-sparing strategy because of drug-induced complications. Fluctuations and quality of life improved in all patients. We identified 4 case series, 1 prospective and 1 retrospective study that included a total of 50 DBS-treated patients who required an infusion therapy. Improvement in motor outcomes, assessed in different ways, was a constant finding. Selected PD patients on 1 DAT may experience additional benefit from a second DAT, for several reasons along the course of their disease. Although infusion therapies optimize dopaminergic drug delivery in fluctuating DBS-treated patients, DBS added on LCIG treatment has an additive symptomatic effect that allows levodopa dose reduction in patients with drug-induced side effects.

A geomorphological survey immediately west of the Minoan town of Malia (Crete) shows that a tsunami resulting from the Bronze Age Santorini eruption reached the outskirts of the Palatial center. Sediment cores testify a unique erosional event during the Late Minoan period, followed locally by a high energy sand unit comprising marine fauna. This confirms that a tsunami impacted northern Crete and caused an inundation up to 400 m inland at Malia. We obtained a radiocarbon range of 1744-1544 BCE for the secure pre-tsunami context and an interval 1509-1430 BCE for the post-event layer. Examination of tsunami deposits was used to constrain run-up not exceeding 8 m asl. The results open the field for new research on the Bronze Age Santorini tsunami regarding both impact and consequences for the Minoan civilization.

"The present sub-analysis aimed to examine the relationship between obesity index and cardiovascular risk among primary care attendees. Stratified random sampling was previously used to recruit general practitioners, practicing on Crete island, Greece, whose patients were then enrolled. Initial sample included 815 primary care attendees (55.7% women; mean age 65.2 years; range 40-98 years). Due to missing values regarding 13 participants, data from 802 patients were included for the current analysis. Body measurements (weight, height), among other bio-clinical parameters, were recorded upon practice visit. The 10-year cardiovascular disease risk was estimated using the European Society of Cardiology (and other societies), 10-year Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation and multivariate linear regression was used to assess relationships between Obesity Index and cardiovascular disease risk. Higher risk is shown to be significantly related with male gender, older age, unemployed/retired status, urban area of living or smoking (p&lt;0.05), as well as with higher levels of obesity index (stand. beta=0.048, p=0.028). Obesity Index may be useful for cardiovascular disease risk prediction and correction at the primary care settings, since obesity is easily addressed during the first medical contact."

"Despite the significant progress that has been made during the last decade, Greece still faces the effects of road traffic accidents (RTAs) to a great extent every year. This study represents an epidemiological approach to road traffic injuries (RTIs) presenting to a secondary hospital in a geographical area with very low-quality road network; it aims to indicate possible preventive measures and actions. The present study was conducted in Rethymnon General Hospital between January 2018 and February 2020. Data from all trauma patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) after RTAs were retrospectively collected from patient medical records. The severity of injury sustained by road traffic victims was graded using the Injury Severity Score (ISS). During the study period, 1582 trauma patients presented to the ED after RTAs. There were 1079 men and 503 women and the median age was 30 years. In total, 818 motorcycle-related injuries (51.7%), 497 automobile-related injuries (31.4%), 165 bicycle-related injuries (10.4%) and 102 pedestrian injuries (6.4%) were documented. Of the 1582 trauma patients, 58.2% (921) presented with injuries to the extremities, 35.3% (554) presented with thoracic injuries, 34.4% (541) presented with head injuries, 30% (475) presented with spinal column injuries, 17.4% (271) presented with facial injuries, 12.9% (203) presented with abdominal injuries and 10.3% (162) presented with pelvic injuries. A significant increase in the number of incidents was noticed during the tourist season. Median ISS was 2 (IQR=4). 53.7% of patients who were transferred to the hospital by ambulance had an ISS&amp;le;4. In 41 cases, transportation to a tertiary hospital was necessary, six patients had emergency operations and 13 others died in the ED. The median length of hospital stay was 3 (IQR=6) days. Actions that could possibly mitigate the burden of RTIs in the district of Rethymnon include upgrading the level of law enforcement, implementing educational strategies and information campaigns against inappropriate ambulance use, encouraging facilities to develop trauma registries and ensuring adequate hospital staffing."

This baseline intends to report on littering related to single-use plastic straws, contextualized on two touristic beaches on the Northern shores of Crete (Greece). While beached straws were found to be mainly depending on local drivers, the study further highlighted an additional source of pollution related to plastic straws: the clear wrap in which single-use items can be offered to users. Over the summer months, a number of discarded straw wraps was in fact found, significantly related to both beach width and the presence of colorful straws. Wraps are different in shape, material, as well as likelihood of being dispersed and broken down in the environment, and easily escape estimates from non-targeted sampling. The ban on single use items seems then to be the most effective approach to avoid straws and, indirectly, straw wraps litter or spills.

"Early-life antibiotic use has been hypothesized to promote weight gain and increase the risk of childhood obesity. To examine the associations of prenatal and infant antibiotics with childhood growth, adiposity and cardiometabolic traits in the Greek Rhea cohort. We used data from 747 mother-child pairs with anthropometric measurements drawn from medical records or measured at 4 and 6 years of age. Antibiotic exposure was assessed by maternal report during pregnancy and at the first year of life. Children were classified as exposed to antibiotics prenatally if the mother received at least one course of oral antibiotics during pregnancy and postnatally if the mother reported that the child received at least one oral antibiotic treatment during the first year of life. Outcomes included repeated weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, body fat (%), total cholesterol and blood pressure. We applied mixed effects, linear and log-binomial regression models after adjusting for important covariates. Around 14.6% of the participating children were prenatally exposed to antibiotics and 32.4% received antibiotics during the first year of life. Prenatal exposure to antibiotics was associated with a twofold increase in the risk for obesity (risk ratio [RR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.09 [1.58, 2.76]) and abdominal obesity (RR [95% CI]: 2.56 [1.89, 3.47]) at 6 years. Postnatal exposure to antibiotics was associated with increased weight (beta [95% CI]: 00.25 [0.06, 0.44]) and BMI (beta [95% CI]: 0.23 [0.003, 0.45]) SD scores from 2 to 7 years of life. Early-life antibiotic use was associated with accelerated childhood growth and higher adiposity."

Maintaining thyroid homeostasis during pregnancy is vital for fetal development. The few studies that have investigated associations between metal exposure and gestational thyroid function have yielded mixed findings. To evaluate the association of exposure to a mixture of toxic metals with thyroid parameters in 824 pregnant women from the Rhea birth cohort in Crete, Greece. Concentrations of three toxic metals [cadmium (Cd), antimony (Sb), lead (Pb)] and iodine were measured in urine using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and thyroid hormones [Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), and free triiodothyronine (fT3)] were measured in serum in early pregnancy. Associations of individual metals with thyroid parameters were assessed using adjusted regression models, while associations of the metal mixture with thyroid parameters were assessed using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR).Women with high (3rd tertile) concentrations of urinary Cd, Sb and Pb, respectively, had 13.3 % (95%CI: 2.0 %, 23.2 %), 12.5 % (95%CI: 1.8 %, 22.0 %) and 16.0 % (95%CI: 5.7 %, 25.2 %) lower TSH compared to women with low concentrations (2nd and 1st tertile). In addition, women with high urinary Cd had 2.2 % (95%CI: 0.0 %, 4.4 %) higher fT4 and 4.0 % (95%CI: -0.1 %, 8.1 %) higher fT3 levels, and women with high urinary Pb had 4 % (95%CI: 0.2 %, 8.0 %) higher fT3 levels compared to women with low exposure. The negative association of Cd with TSH persisted only when iodine sufficiency was unfavorable. BKMR attested that simultaneous exposure to toxic metals was associated with decreased TSH and increased fT3 and revealed a potential synergistic interaction of Cd and Pb in association with TSH. The present results suggest that exposure to toxic metals even at low levels can alter gestational thyroid homeostasis.

"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic induced economic shock in Greece, which translated into a decrease in household income. Thus, the objective of this study is to measure social inequality with regard to income loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece. In addition, we aim to identify the characteristics of those experiencing income loss due to the pandemic. The study uses data from the ""Public Opinion in the European Union (EU) in Time of Coronavirus Crisis. Third Round"" survey. The sample consists of 1036 individuals aged between 16 and 54 years. To measure inequality, the Erreygers' Concentration Index (CI) is calculated, using social class as the ranking variable. To identify the characteristics of those experiencing income loss, a logistic regression model is fitted using the region of residence and several demographic and socioeconomic variables as potential predictors. According to the results, social inequality does not exist with regard to income loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, our findings indicate the negative influence of the pandemic on the incomes of individuals from all social classes in Greece. According to the results of the logistic regression model, the odds of experiencing income loss are higher for residents of the Aegean Islands and Crete but also for self-employed, part-time employed, and unemployed individuals. These findings indicate the negative influence of the pandemic on Greek tourism and on sectors employing a large proportion of non-standard workers. Although inequality does not exist, a substantial proportion of those losing income due to the pandemic is in line with the global picture."

"Polypharmacy and multimorbidity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly prevalent, with potential associations with worse COPD outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics and outcomes of polypharmacy, investigate the relationship of polypharmacy with health status and exacerbations and assess the prevalence of inappropriate medication (PIM), risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug-to-drug interactions in COPD patients. A total of 245 COPD patients were enrolled from primary care in Crete, Greece. Patients completed a questionnaire and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Multimorbidity was defined as having two or more comorbidities and polypharmacy was defined as taking five or more drugs per day. Most of COPD patients (77.0%) and the majority (83.6%) of elderly (≥65 years) had multimorbidity, while polypharmacy was evident in 55.2% of all patients and 62.4% in elderly. After adjustments for age, gender and pack-years, polypharmacy was associated with CAT ≥ 10, multimorbidity, several cardiometabolic diseases, cancer and depression-anxiety and prostate disorders (all p values &gt; 0.05). PIMs were found in 9.6% of subjects aged ≥65 years and were mainly mental health medication. Due to coadministration of medications, 22.3% of the population were at cumulative risk for falls, 17% for constipation and 12.8% for cardiovascular events. Finally, 15 pairs of drug-to-drug interactions were identified in 11.5% of patients. Our data suggest that polypharmacy is highly prevalent and associated with worse health status and prescription risks in COPD patients. These findings potentially introduce an additional challenge on effective management of these patients."

This study examined the relationship between empathy and mobile phone dependence levels of the nursing staff in a public hospital in the island of Crete, using a cross-sectional study design. Data from 109 staff nurses and healthcare assistants (HCAs) were collected via the Greek version of the Mobile Phone Dependence Questionnaire (MPDQ) and the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ). Multiple linear regression was used to determine the correlation between empathy and mobile phone dependency. The total mean score for TEQ was 33.9 (±5.7). Accordingly, the total mean score for MPDQ was 22.9 (±6.1). High mobile phone dependence was found in 4.7% of the participants. A statistically significant difference was found between HCAs and staff nurses, with HCAs presenting a higher mean empathy levels (TEQ) (36.5 vs. 32.6) and lower dependence levels (MPDQ) (18.9 vs. 24.5) than staff nurses. A significant correlation between empathy and dependence was found between dependence and the altruism empathy subscale, with higher dependence being correlated with lower altruism. The participants' levels of empathy do not seem to be affected by mobile phone dependence. However, empathy appears to be strongly determined by increased age and professional status. Nurses' dependence on mobile phones is a complex phenomenon that requires attention. Educational programs on empathy and information on the proper use of mobile phones by the nursing staff should be provided.

The high genetic diversity of HLA across populations significantly confines the effectiveness of a donor or umbilical cord blood search for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This study aims to probe the HLA immunogenetic profile of the population of Crete, a Greek region with specific geographic and historical characteristics, and to investigate potential patterns in HLA distribution following comparison with the Deutsche Knochenmarkspenderdatei (DKMS) donor registry. It also aims to highlight the importance of regional public cord blood banks (PCBBs) in fulfilling HSCT needs, especially in countries with significant genetic diversity. A cohort of 1835 samples representative of the Cretan population was typed for HLA class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and class II (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPB1) loci by high-resolution second field next-generation sequencing. Data were compared with the respective HLA profiles of 12 DKMS populations (n = 20 032). Advanced statistical and bioinformatics methods were employed to assess specific intra- and inter-population genetic indexes associated with the regional and geographic distribution of HLA alleles and haplotypes. A considerable HLA allelic and haplotypic diversity was identified among the Cretan samples and between the latter and the pooled DKMS cohort. Even though the HLA allele and haplotype frequency distribution was similar to regions of close geographic proximity to Crete, a clinal distribution pattern from the northern to southern regions was identified. Significant differences were also observed between Crete and the Greek population of DKMS. This study provides an in-depth characterization of the HLA immunogenetic profile in Crete and reveals the importance of demographic history in HLA heterogeneity and donor selection. The novel HLA allele and haplotype frequency comparative data between the Cretan and other European populations signify the importance of regional PCBBs in prioritizing HLA diversity to efficiently promote the HSCT program at the national level and beyond.

Decisions on which pesticide to use in agriculture are expected to become more difficult, as the number of available chemicals is decreasing. For Tetranychus urticae (T. urticae), a major pest for which a number of candidate markers for pesticide resistance are in place, molecular diagnostics could support decision-making for the rational use of acaricides. A suite of 12 TaqMan qPCR assays [G314D (GluCl1), G326E, I321T (GluCl3), G119S, F331W (Ace-1), H92R (PSST), L1024V, F1538I (VGSC), I1017F (CHS1), G126S, S141F, P262T (cytb)], were validated against Sanger-sequencing, and subsequently adapted for use with the ddPCR technology. The concordance correlation coefficient between the actual and ddPCR measured mutant allelic frequencies was 0.995 (95% CI = 0.991-0.998), and no systematic, proportional, or random differences were detected. The achieved Limit of Detection (LoD) was 0.1% (detection of one mutant in a background of 999 wild type mites). The ddPCR assay panel was then assessed in terms of agreement with phenotypic resistance, through a pilot application in field populations from Crete, with strong correlation and thus predictive and diagnostic value of the molecular assays in some cases (e.g., etoxazole and abamectin resistance). Molecular diagnostics were able to capture incipient resistance that was otherwise missed by phenotypic bioassays. The molecular and phenotypic resistance screening of T. urticae field populations from Crete, revealed both multi-resistant and susceptible populations. The highly sensitive T. urticae molecular diagnostic platforms developed in this study could prove a valuable tool for pesticide resistance management. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

"Cesarean scar pregnancies carry a high risk of pregnancy complications including placenta previa with antepartum hemorrhage, placenta accreta spectrum, and uterine rupture. To evaluate the development of utero-placental circulation in the first half of pregnancy in ongoing cesarean scar pregnancies and compare it with pregnancies implanted in the lower uterine segment above a previous cesarean delivery scar with no evidence of placenta accreta spectrum at delivery STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective case-control study conducted in 2 tertiary referral centers. The study group included 27 women who were diagnosed with a live cesarean scar pregnancy in the first trimester of pregnancy and who elected to conservative management. The control group included 27 women diagnosed with an anterior low-lying placenta or placenta previa at 19 to 22 weeks of gestation who had first and early second trimester ultrasound examinations. In both groups, the first ultrasound examination was carried out at 6 to 10 weeks to establish the pregnancy location, viability, and to confirm the gestational age. The utero-placental and intraplacental vasculatures were examined using color Doppler imaging and were described semiquantitatively using a score of 1 to 4. The remaining myometrial thickness was recorded in the study group, whereas the ultrasound features of a previous cesarean delivery scar including the presence of a niche were noted in the controls. Both the cesarean scar pregnancies and the controls had ultrasound examinations at 11 to 14 and 19 to 22 weeks of gestation. The mean color Doppler imaging vascularity score in the ultrasound examination at 6 to 10 weeks was significantly (P&lt;.001) higher in the cesarean scar pregnancy group than in the controls. High vascularity scores of 3 and 4 were recorded in 20 of 27 (74%) cases of the cesarean scar pregnancy group. There was no vascularity score of 4, and only 3 of 27 (11%) controls had a vascularity score of 3. In 15 of the 27 (55.6%) cesarean scar pregnancies, the residual myometrial thickness was &lt;2 mm. In the ultrasound examination at 11 to 14 weeks, there was no significant difference between the groups in the number of cases with an increased subplacental vascularity. However, 12 cesarean scar pregnancies (44%) presented with 1 or more placental lacunae whereas there was no case with lacunae in the controls. Of the 18 cesarean scar pregnancies that progressed into the third trimester, 10 of them were diagnosed with placenta previa accreta at birth, including 4 creta and 6 increta. In the 19 to 22 weeks ultrasound examination, 8 of the 10 placenta accreta spectrum patients presented with subplacental hypervascularity, out of which 6 showed placental lacunae. The vascular changes in the utero-placental and intervillous circulations in cesarean scar pregnancies are due to the loss of the normal uterine structure in the scar area and the development of placental tissue in proximity of large diameter arteries of the outer uterine wall. The intensity of these vascular changes, the development of placenta accreta spectrum, and the risk of uterine rupture are probably related to the residual myometrial thickness of the scar defect at the start of pregnancy. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of the utero-placental vascular changes associated with cesarean scar pregnancies should help in identifying those cases that may develop major complications. It will contribute to providing counseling for women about the risks associated with different management strategies."

"Asthma diagnosis and management remains a challenging task for the medical community. The aim of the present study was to present the functional and inflammatory profiles of patients with difficult-to-treat asthma in a real-life clinical setting referred to the specialized asthma clinic at the University Hospital of Heraklion. The registry included a cohort of 267 patients who were referred to the severe asthma clinic. Patients were assessed with emphasis on the history of allergies, nasal polyposis or other comorbidities. Blood testing for eosinophils counts and total and specific IgE, and pulmonary function tests were performed at baseline. The median age of patients with asthma was 55 years old, 68.5% were women and 58.3% were never smokers. The vast majority presented with late onset asthma (75.7%), whereas eight (3%) patients were on oral corticosteroids. The median number of exacerbations during the last 12 months was 1 (0-3). Furthermore, 50.7% of patients had a positive serum allergy test, the median eosinophil count was 300 (188-508.5) cells/µl of blood and median total IgE level was 117.5 (29.4-360.5) IU/ml. Patients were retrospectively grouped in the following categories: Group 1, mild-moderate asthma; group 2, patients prescribed a step 4 or 5 asthma therapy according to Global Initiative for Asthma; and group 3, patients on biologic agents. Group 1 had significantly higher FEV1% than groups 2 and 3 (93.4 vs. 79.9 and 79.4%, respectively; P&lt;0.001). Finally, the median Asthma Control Questionnaire 7 (ACQ7) score was 1.14, with patients from groups 2 and 3 presenting higher ACQ7 scores compared with group 1 patients as expected (1.1 and 2.1 vs. 0.7, respectively; P&lt;0.001). To the best of our knowledge, this was the first real-life asthma study in Crete that demonstrated that severe asthmatics predominantly have late-onset asthma with airflow obstruction and uncontrolled symptoms."

Aside from providing adaptive immunity, type I CRISPR-Cas was recently unearthed to employ a noncanonical RNA guide (CreA) to transcriptionally repress an RNA toxin (CreT). Here, we report that, for most archaeal and bacterial CreTA modules, the creA gene actually carries two flanking 'CRISPR repeats', which are, however, highly divergent and degenerated. By deep sequencing, we show that the two repeats give rise to an 8-nt 5' handle and a 22-nt 3' handle, respectively, i.e., the conserved elements of a canonical CRISPR RNA, indicating they both retained critical nucleotides for Cas6 processing during divergent degeneration. We also uncovered a minimal CreT toxin that sequesters the rare transfer RNA for isoleucine, tRNAIleCAU, with a six-codon open reading frame containing two consecutive AUA codons. To fully relieve its toxicity, both tRNAIleCAU overexpression and supply of extra agmatine (modifies the wobble base of tRNAIleCAU to decipher AUA codons) are required. By replacing AUA to AGA/AGG codons, we reprogrammed this toxin to sequester rare arginine tRNAs. These data provide essential information on CreTA origin and for future CreTA prediction, and enrich the knowledge of tRNA-sequestering small RNAs that are employed by CRISPR-Cas to get addictive to the host.

"Living a healthy life in a supporting environment are key elements towards higher diet quality in older age. The Mediterranean Diet in Older Adults (MINOA) study collected cross-sectional data from adults ≥65 years old (<i>n</i> = 436) from April 2014 to November 2015 in rural Crete, aiming to understand the interrelations between Mediterranean Diet adherence, Social Capital and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL). Multivariate linear regression, carried out using SPSS 20.0, revealed that both Social Capital and HRQL has a positive impact on Mediterranean Diet adherence after adjustment for confounders and independently of each other. Total Social Capital as well as its Value of Life/Social Agency component (β = 0.04 and β = 0.1, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, respectively) had a positive relationship with Mediterranean Diet adherence. As far as HRQL is concerned, only the Physical Health components were found to have a positive association with Mediterranean Diet adherence (β = 0.09, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). At the same time Total Social Capital was also seen to have a positive relationship with perceived Physical and Mental Health (β = 0.21 and β = 0.28, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively). In a population of older adults Social Capital, HRQL and Mediterranean Diet adherence seem to share intricate interrelations that impact both diet quality and quality of life overall."

"The neglected and underutilized plants (NUPs) could become alternative food sources in the agro-alimentary sector, enriching human and animal diets, offering the opportunity for sustainable exploitation, resilience to climate change, and production with resistance to pests and diseases. In the Mediterranean countries, these valuable resources are threatened by climate change, overexploitation, and/or monoculture. In this framework, we evaluated 399 local endemic NUPs of Crete (Greece), the Mediterranean coast, Rif of Morocco, and Tunisia, regarding their agro-alimentary potential, and assessed their feasibility and readiness timescale for sustainable exploitation with own previously published methodology. The methodological scheme was developed by experts in co-creative workshops, using point-scoring of seven attributes to evaluate the potential of the targeted NUPs in the agro-alimentary. Our results showed a diversity of promising local endemic NUPs of different families in the studied regions (Lamiaceae members are prominent), and we outlined the cases of 13 taxa with the highest optimum scores of agro-alimentary potential (&gt;70%). Despite the diversity or the promising potential and current ex-situ conservation efforts to bridge gaps, our study indicated that only a few cases of Cretan local endemic NUPs can be sustainably exploited in the short-term. However, it is argued that many more local endemic NUPs can easily follow sustainable exploitation schemes if specific research gaps are bridged. Since NUPs can help to increased diversification of food production systems by adding new nutritional/beneficial species to human and animal diets, basic and applied research, as well as market and stakeholder attraction, is suggested as prerequisite to unlock the full potential of the focal endemic NUPs in the agro-alimentary sector."

Crete with its complex geomorphological history is the island with the highest number of endemism observed in animal and plant taxa throughout the Aegean archipelago. While other groups of organisms within Crete are well-studied, the freshwater gastropod fauna still remains poorly investigated. Bythinella and Pseudamnicola, are 2 genera of freshwater springsnails, both present on the island, inhabiting springs and other freshwater habitats. Here, we conduct a comprehensive study on the distribution of the different genetic lineages of the 2 gastropod genera in order to assess the mode of their differentiation on the island and infer the actual number of species present in the island. Towards these aims, sequence data from the mitochondrial gene were used and analyzed within a phylogenetic framework. For Bythinella, our results strongly support at least 5 delineated Bythinella spp. inhabiting Crete, which correspond to the already described species from previous studies with the addition of a new one. Bythinella analyses reveal an old time-frame of differentiation with vicariant phenomena being more likely the main drivers shaping the present-day distribution of the genus' genetic lineages. For Pseudamnicola, our data indicate the presence of at least 2 delineated Pseudamnicola spp. with a differentiation more consistent to an isolation-by-distance pattern of a relatively recent origin. Dispersion processes followed by isolation of the populations and/or recent speciation, seem to be the underlying process for the current distribution of Pseudamnicola lineages.

Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at increased risk of infections from vaccine-preventable diseases. This study focuses on compliance of T1D patients to the recommended vaccination schedule, vaccination of their close contacts for influenza and on factors potentially contributing to vaccination program deviations. The study population comprised children, adolescents and adults with T1D under follow-up at the Department of Pediatrics University Hospital and the Diabetic Center General Hospital, Heraklion, Crete-Greece. Data were extracted, following informed consent, from individual's vaccination booklet, medical files and telephone interview. Vaccination records, demographic parameters, glycemic control and influenza vaccination of close contacts were assessed. The study included 258 participants (111 children/adolescents, 147 adults). Vaccination coverage for influenza was 76.7% for children, 64.4% for adults, for PCV 90.9% for children, but only 10.8% for the 23-valent, for hepatitis B 99% for children and 78.2% for adults. Youngsters were vaccinated against Hib 91.9%, meningococcus C 98.2%, measles-mumps-rubella 90.3%, chickenpox 86.4%, hepatitis A 76.5% and HPV 42.5%. Less than 65% of all individuals were fully vaccinated for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and meningococcus ACWY. Approximately 50% of the 605 close contacts were not vaccinated against influenza. Individuals with better glycemic status seemed to adhere to the recommended schedule and had a better vaccinated family environment. Vaccination coverage for T1D individuals was sufficient regarding the majority of routine childhood vaccines, but less for adolescence and group-specific vaccines. Their family contacts were not sufficiently vaccinated for influenza. Targeted interventions are required in order to increase vaccination rates.

We present an updated time frame for the 30 m thick late Miocene sedimentary Trachilos section from the island of Crete that contains the potentially oldest hominin footprints. The section is characterized by normal magnetic polarity. New and published foraminifera biostratigraphy results suggest an age of the section within the Mediterranean biozone MMi13d, younger than ~ 6.4 Ma. Calcareous nannoplankton data from sediments exposed near Trachilos and belonging to the same sub-basin indicate deposition during calcareous nannofossil biozone CN9bB, between 6.023 and 6.727 Ma. By integrating the magneto- and biostratigraphic data we correlate the Trachilos section with normal polarity Chron C3An.1n, between 6.272 and 6.023 Ma. Using cyclostratigraphic data based on magnetic susceptibility, we constrain the Trachilos footprints age at ~ 6.05 Ma, roughly 0.35 Ma older than previously thought. Some uncertainty remains related to an inaccessible interval of ~ 8 m section and the possibility that the normal polarity might represent the slightly older Chron C3An.2n. Sediment accumulation rate and biostratigraphic arguments, however, stand against these points and favor a deposition during Chron C3An.1n.

"Population aging, characteristic of modern Western societies, is associated with various forms of cognitive decline. Insomnia/insomnia-type symptoms have been reported as modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline. The objective of this study was to examine, in a comprehensive way (a) the prevalence and the risk factors associated with insomnia-type symptoms and (b) the association of insomnia-type symptoms with cognitive impairment in a large, homogeneous, community-dwelling population in the island of Crete, Greece. Our sample consisted of 3066 community-dwelling elders aged 60-100 years participating in the Cretan Aging Cohort. All participants were interviewed with a structured questionnaire assessing demographics, physical and mental health, sleep, lifestyle habits and cognitive function using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Furthermore, insomnia-type symptom prevalence was estimated in the presence of one or more sleep complaints. Linear and logistic regression analyses examined (a) the association between insomnia-type symptoms and demographics, physical/mental health and lifestyle and (b) the association between cognition and insomnia-type symptoms. Prevalence of one or more insomnia-type symptoms was 64.6%. Multivariate analyses showed that female gender, widowhood, benzodiazepine use and physical ailments were significantly associated with insomnia-type symptoms. Multivariate models also showed that insomnia-type symptoms were associated with increased odds of cognitive impairment (p &lt; 0.0001). In a large population of older people in Crete, Greece, insomnia-type symptoms are very prevalent and associated with increased risk for cognitive impairment. Future studies should assess whether treatment of sleep problems improves or delays the deterioration of cognitive function in older adults."

"Cognitive impairment and frailty are major problems of older age. This study aims to explore the association between frailty and cognitive impairment in a rural cohort of older subjects in southern Europe (Cretan Aging Cohort). Community-based, primary care, cross-sectional, study in the Heraklion Prefecture, Crete, Greece. Four hundred and two persons aged 60-100 years from the Cretan Aging Cohort [100 with dementia, 175 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 127 cognitively non-impaired] were enrolled, mostly rural dwellers (86.2%). Frailty was assessed with the Simple ""Frail"" Questionnaire Screening Tool. Demographic data, BMI, Mini-Mental State Examination scores (MMSE), severity of dementia according to the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, and depressive symptoms according to the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were recorded. Frailty was present in 17% of persons with dementia (73.8% of mild severity), in 6.3% of persons with MCI and in 8.7% of cognitively non-impaired persons (P &lt; 0.05). Among the various frailty variables, fatigue and difficulty walking were significantly more frequently reported by persons with dementia. Each frailty variable and the frailty score correlated negatively with MMSE score and positively with GDS score and polypharmacy. Multivariate analysis revealed that reported fatigue improved the identification of dementia in addition to MMSE, significantly and independently of symptoms of depression (P = 0.04). Frailty rates are significantly higher in persons with dementia. In this predominantly rural cohort of older subjects, reported fatigue could serve as a marker of physical decline and a complementary index for referral for further neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric evaluation."

A tumor-to-tumor metastasis inside a meningioma is a rare phenomenon. Malignant neoplasms of the breast and lung are the most common primary tumors. Other sites of origin include prostate, renal and gastric neoplasms. The included case files were retrieved from the medical records of the University Hospital of Crete, Greece. A review of the literature was conducted in March 2020 via PubMed. Relevant search results were few. We report a case of a 66-year-old female, with known Small Cell Lung Cancer, who presented with left-sided hemiparesis. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan revealed a right frontal extra-axial mass. The patient underwent a craniotomy and a gross total removal of the tumor. Histological examination of the excised mass revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma deposits inside a meningioma: tumor-to-tumor metastasis. Reviewing the available literature, it has been hypothesized that the following factors play a role in the pathophysiology of this phenomenon: progesterone and estrogen receptors, cell-to-cell adhesion molecules, rich vascularization, favorable metabolic, micro-and immunological environment. Meningiomas seem to be the most common type of intracranial neoplasm to host a metastasis. There is a difference between tumor-to-tumor metastasis and collision tumors. The former implies a recipient role of the host tumor, and the latter refers to a co-localization of two different tumors that grow into one another, both being in the same organ. Tumor-to-tumor brain metastasis is a well-described phenomenon but with unclear pathophysiology. Deeper knowledge could be beneficial for its management.

"Comprehensive data on variant transthyretin amyloidosis polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) in Greece are lacking. We presently provide an overview of ATTRv-PN in Greece, focusing on unexplored non-endemic regions of the country. In total, we identified 57 cases of ATTRv-PN diagnosed over the past 25 years, including 30 from the island of Crete, an apparent endemic region. Patients carried 10 different TTR mutations (C10R; P24S; V30M; R34G; R34T; I68L; A81T; E89Q; E89K and V94A). Carriers of the common V30M mutation constituted 54.3 % of the cohort. A known founder effect for the V30M mutation was present on the island of Crete. Non-endemic cases identified outside the island of Crete are presently reported in more detail. The age of onset ranged from 25 to 77 years, with a mean of 51.1 years. A mean diagnostic delay of 3.2 years was observed. V30M patients had earlier onset and less cardiac involvement than patients carrying other mutations. Genotype-phenotype correlations were largely consistent with published data. We conclude that, with the exception of the Cretan cluster, ATTRv-PN is not endemic in the Greek population. This makes timely diagnosis more challenging, yet absolutely essential given the availability of therapies that can alter the long-term course of the disease."

The objective of this article is to assess the adherence of pregnant women to the national recommendations for influenza and pertussis vaccination and the reasons behind their non-adherence. This was a retrospective observational study conducted in a well-defined puerperant population of adequate healthcare standards from December 2018 to December 2019. The study was carried out with 1006 puerperants and 66 health care practitioners. Data were collected, including demographic-obstetric features of pregnant women, whether they received antenatal vaccination, the reasons for having been vaccinated or not as well as health professional's opinion regarding antenatal immunization. The uptake of influenza and pertussis vaccine during pregnancy was suboptimal with lack of recommendation of the vaccine by the healthcare providers being the main barrier. Factors positively associated with antenatal vaccination against influenza were higher level of maternal education and advanced maternal age while antenatal vaccination against pertussis was positively associated with higher level of maternal education. This large-scale retrospective study reveals the inadequacy of antenatal vaccination rates against pertussis and influenza in Crete, Greece. Results suggest that obstetricians' confidence in vaccination is of outmost importance for implementing immunization in pregnancy and any doubts on vaccine effectiveness and safety should be resolved. Routine antenatal vaccination counseling and pregnancy immunization campaigns are essential to improve vaccine uptake during pregnancy.

"One of the main reasons that influence parental choice to postpone or avoid children's vaccination is insufficient knowledge. Mothers' knowledge can be considered as an important factor when determining childcare, as they are often the primary decision maker for their children's healthcare issues. This study aimed to assess the level of mothers' knowledge and practice on certain aspects of vaccination for their child/children in Greece. This was an online cross-sectional survey, which collected information about mother's socio-demographic characteristics, vaccination-related information, and vaccine knowledge using a self-administered questionnaire. The survey was conducted between April 2020 and June 2020 and the study population included mothers over 18 years old with at least one child (&lt; 18 years old), living in four broad geographical areas of Greece (Attica, Central Greece, North Greece, and Crete/Aegean Islands). A total of 1885 Greek mothers participated in the study. The majority stated that they vaccined their child/children (98%), and the most popular source of information about vaccination was their child's pediatrician (89%). About half of participants (52%) have delayed their child/children vaccination with their pediatrician's suggestion being the main driver. The median knowledge score was 11 which indicates a high knowledge level for childhood vaccination among Greek mothers. Multiple linear regression analysis identified an inverse association between education and knowledge score, characterized by higher knowledge scores among individuals with secondary and even higher among those with higher education. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the strict adherence to the prescribed dosage as indicated by the local recommendations for each vaccine, was associated with most of the knowledge items included in the study. Our findings show that the vast majority of mothers in Greece did vaccinate their child/children, while pediatricians appear to have a very influential role in mothers' decision making. High knowledge around vaccination was associated with mothers' educational attainment, being particularly high among those who completed higher education. Considerable attention is required from public health authorities to promote vaccination through educational programs and campaigns, particularly aimed at people with lower educational attainment. Additionally, improving communication between pediatricians and mothers to reach those women who have not decided to vaccinate or delayed vaccination for their children, may prove to be very beneficial."

"The olive tree of Vouves in Crete, is considered the oldest producing olive tree in the world with an estimated age exceeding 4000 years. In the present study, we sequenced two samples (from the bottom and the top of the tree) to elucidate the genetic relation of this ancient tree with other olive cvs as well as to gain some insights about its origin. Our results showed that both samples have different genetic origins, proving that this ancient tree has been grafted at least one time. On the basis of whole genome sequences the sample from the top of the Vouves tree showed relation of the same order than half-siblings to one accession corresponding to the present-day Greek cv 'Mastoidis'. Nevertheless, in the framework of a microsatellite analysis it was found to cluster with the 'Mastoidis' samples. The Vouves rootstock (bottom sample) showed a clear grouping with the oleaster samples in a similar way to that of 'Megaritiki' Greek cv although it does not show any signal of introgression from them. The genomic analyses did not show a strong relation of this sample with the present-day Greek cvs analyzed in this study so it cannot be proved that it has been used as a source for cultivated olive tree populations represented by available genome sequences. Nevertheless, on the basis of microsatellite analyses, the Vouves rootstock showed affinity with two present-day Greek cvs, one ""ancient"" rootstock from continental Greece as well as monumental trees from Cyprus. The analysis of the impact of the variants in the gene space revealed an enrichment of genes associated to pathways related with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. This is in agreement with what has been found before in the sweep regions related with the process of domestication. The absence of oleaster gene flow, its old age and its variant profile, similar to other cultivated populations, makes it an excellent reference point for domestication studies."

PM<sub>2.5</sub> atmospheric samples were regularly collected between January 2013 and March 2015 at a central location of Eastern Mediterranean (Island of Crete) during African dust events (DES) and periods of absence of such episodes as controls (CS). The elemental composition and microbiome DES and CS were thoroughly investigated. Fifty-six major and trace elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Relative mass abundances (RMA) of major crustal elements and lanthanoids were higher in DES than in CS. Conversely in CS, RMAs were higher for most anthropogenic transition metals. Lanthanum-to-other lanthanoids concentration ratios for DES approached the corresponding reference values for continental crust and several African dust source regions, while in CS they exceeded these values. USEPA's UNMIX receptor model, applied in all PM<sub>2.5</sub> samples, established that African dust is the dominant contributing source (by 80%) followed by road dust/fuel oil emissions (17%) in the receptor area. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) identified dust hotspots in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. The application of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed high variation of bacterial composition and diversity between DES and CS samples. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroides were the most dominant in both DES and CS samples, representing ~88% of the total bacterial diversity. Cutibacterium, Tumebacillus and Sphingomonas dominated the CS samples, while Rhizobium and Brevundimonas were the most prevalent genera in DES. Mutual exclusion/co-occurrence network analysis indicated that Sphingomonas and Chryseobacterium exhibited the highest degrees of mutual exclusion in CS, while in DES the corresponding species were Brevundimonas, Delftia, Rubellimicrobium, Flavobacterium, Blastococcus, and Pseudarthrobacter. Some of these microorganisms are emerging global opportunistic pathogens and an increase in human exposure to them as a result of environmental changes, is inevitable.

"Accumulating evidence suggests that in utero exposures can influence the development of the immune system. Few studies have investigated whether prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is associated with allergy-related phenotypes in childhood, nor explored sex differences. We examined the association between prenatal exposure to POPs and offspring allergic outcomes in early and mid-childhood. We included 682 mother-child pairs from the prospective birth cohort Rhea. We measured dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 6 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in maternal first trimester serum. Parents completed the questionnaires adapted from the International Study on Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC) for allergy-related phenotypes when their children were 4 and 6 years old. We used Poisson regression models to estimate Risk Ratios. Prenatal HCB was associated with increased risk for rhinoconjunctivitis at 6 years (RR (95% CI): 2.5; (1.3, 4.8) for a doubling in the exposure). Among girls, prenatal DDE was associated with increased risk for current wheeze, current asthma and current rhinoconjunctivitis at 4 years (RR (95%CI): 1.4 (0.8, 2.6), 1.6 (1.1, 2.4) and 1.8 (1.0, 3.3) and p-interaction = 0.035, 0.027 and 0.059, respectively), with increased risk for current rhinoconjunctivitis at 6 years (RR (95%CI): 1.7 (0.7, 3.8) and p-interaction = 0.028) and total PCBs were associated with increased risk for current eczema at 4 years (RR (95%CI): 2.1 (1.1, 4.2) and p-interaction = 0.028). In boys, prenatal DDE was associated with decreased risk for current wheeze and current asthma at 4 years. Our findings suggest that even low levels of exposure to POPs prenatally may affect the development of childhood allergy-related outcomes in a sex and age-specific manner."
PMID:34872193	Sauer J, Hausdorf B	Cladistics. 28(3):300-316	2012	A comparison of DNA-based methods for delimiting species in a Cretan land snail radiation reveals shortcomings of exclusively molecular taxonomy. 	We compared the results of different approaches for delimiting species based on single-locus DNA sequences with those of methods using binary multilocus data. As case study, we examined the radiation of the land snail genus Xerocrassa on Crete. Many of the methods based on mitochondrial sequences resulted in heavy under- or overestimations of the species number. The methods using AFLP data produced classifications with an on average higher concordance with the morphological classification than the methods based on mitochondrial sequences. However, the percentage of correct species classifications is low even with binary multilocus data. Gaussian clustering produced the classifications with the highest concordance with the morphological classification of all approaches applied in this study, both with single-locus sequences and with binary multilocus data. There are two general problems that hamper species delimitation, namely rarity and the hierarchical structure of biodiversity. Methods for species delimitation using genetic data search for clusters of individuals, but do not implement criteria that are sufficient to distinguish clusters representing species from other clusters. The success of morphological species delimitation results from the potential to focus on characters that are directly involved in the speciation process, whereas molecular studies usually rely on markers that are not directly involved in speciation. © The Willi Hennig Society 2011.

The study of insular populations was key in the development of evolutionary theory. The successful colonisation of an island depends on the geographic context, and specific characteristics of the organism and the island, but also on stochastic processes. As a result, apparently identical islands may harbour populations with contrasting histories. Here, we use whole genome sequences of 65 barn owls to investigate the patterns of inbreeding and genetic diversity of insular populations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We focus on Crete and Cyprus, islands with similar size, climate and distance to mainland, that provide natural replicates for a comparative analysis of the impacts of microevolutionary processes on isolated populations. We show that barn owl populations from each island have a separate origin, Crete being genetically more similar to other Greek islands and mainland Greece, and Cyprus more similar to the Levant. Further, our data show that their respective demographic histories following colonisation were also distinct. On the one hand, Crete harbours a small population and maintains very low levels of gene flow with neighbouring populations. This has resulted in low genetic diversity, strong genetic drift, increased relatedness in the population and remote inbreeding. Cyprus, on the other hand, appears to maintain enough gene flow with the mainland to avoid such an outcome. Our study provides a comparative population genomic analysis of the effects of neutral processes on a classical island-mainland model system. It provides empirical evidence for the role of stochastic processes in determining the fate of diverging isolated populations.

This paper presents the earliest evidence for the exploitation of lignite (brown coal) in Europe and sheds new light on the use of combustion fuel sources in the 2nd millennium BCE Eastern Mediterranean. We applied Thermal Desorption/Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and Polarizing Microscopy to the dental calculus of 67 individuals and we identified clear evidence for combustion markers embedded within this calculus. In contrast to the scant evidence for combustion markers within the calculus samples from Egypt, all other individuals show the inhalation of smoke from fires burning wood identified as Pinaceae, in addition to hardwood, such as oak and olive, and/or dung. Importantly, individuals from the Palatial Period at the Mycenaean citadel of Tiryns and the Cretan harbour site of Chania also show the inhalation of fire-smoke from lignite, consistent with the chemical signature of sources in the northwestern Peloponnese and Western Crete respectively. This first evidence for lignite exploitation was likely connected to and at the same time enabled Late Bronze Age Aegean metal and pottery production, significantly by both male and female individuals.

"The recent pandemic has considerably changed urban transportation while highlighting the weaknesses of the current transport modes. The crisis provided a unique opportunity to redesign the urban mobility plans in a more sustainable and resilient way. This study captured the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent restrictive measures on citizens' commuting habits and travel mode choice in two Cretan cities with academic communities and intense seasonality of tourism, in two phases (four periods) before, during, and after the quarantine. The sample consisted of 308 (1st phase) and 193 (2nd phase) citizens, 60% and 30% permanent residents of Chania and Rethymno, respectively. During the weeks before the pandemic, 4/10 participants opted for travelling by car daily, either as a driver or as a passenger; almost the same ratio chose walking; 1/10 used public transport (bus). During the first week of the quarantine, one-quarter had decreased car usage and opted for sustainable transport modes (walking, cycling, public transport). The population who chose walking 1-2 times weekly almost doubled. Nevertheless, most factors were found to affect men and women differently; personal safety and road safety are significantly more important for women; ecological footprint is a less essential parameter for men's travel mode choice. Private vehicle use still holds a considerable role in urban transportation, and noteworthy is due to the sharp decline in public transit in January-February and April and the meager percentage of public transport ridership (1%). The analysis and modelling could be useful in the future design of more sustainable and resilient mobility strategies."

The invasion of the tetrodotoxin (TTX)-bearing silver-cheeked toadfish and potential poisoning due to its consumption (tetrodotoxication) threatens public safety in the Mediterranean Sea. In this study, TTX and TTX analogues of <i>Lagocephalus sceleratus</i> (Gmelin, 1789) were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in fish collected off the island of Crete (Southern Mediterranean). We tested the synergistic effect of a suite of factors potentially affecting toxins' levels and tetrodotoxication risk using general and generalized linear models, respectively. The type of tissue, geographic origin (Cretan Sea, Libyan Sea), sex, and fish maturity stage were significant predictors of toxin concentrations. Mean TTX was higher in gonads and lower in muscles, higher in the Libyan Sea and in female fish, and lower in juvenile (virgin) fish. The concentration of TTX was also significantly and positively correlated with the concentration of several TTX analogues (4-epiTTX, 4,9-anhydroTTX, 11-deoxyTTX, 5,11/6,11-dideoxyTTX, 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX, 11-norTTX-6-ol). The analysis showed that fish originating from the Libyan Sea had significantly higher probability to cause tetrodotoxication in case of consumption. The variability explained by the models developed in this study was relatively low, indicating that toxin levels are hard to predict and the consumption of <i>L. sceleratus</i> should therefore be avoided.

"Medicinal-aromatic plants (MAPs) are important sources for the development of new valuable products of interest to human and animal health, and are also used as ornamentals for the horticulture industry. However, the increased global demand and the uncontrolled exploitation of these plants constitute a threat to their sustainability. To date, few scientific investigations have focused on MAPs valorization and their domestication. The purpose of this study was to evaluate for the first time the medicinal-cosmetic potential of 399 local endemic Mediterranean plants confined to Crete (223 taxa), the Mediterranean coast-Rif of Morocco (94), and Tunisia (82). The new methodological scheme was developed by experts through three multidisciplinary co-creative workshops and was adjusted by end-users to point-scoring of nine attributes evaluating the potential of the targeted neglected and underutilized plants (NUPs) in the medicinal-cosmetic sector. The results were demonstrated as percentage of the maximum possible score. These assessments were further linked and discussed with respect to feasibility and readiness timescale evaluations for sustainable exploitation of the focal NUPs. A great diversity of local endemic NUPs (30 taxa, 11 families) were associated with interesting medicinal-cosmetic properties (&gt;35% up to 94.44%). Among them, 8 taxa showed the highest medicinal-cosmetic potential (&gt;55% of maximum possible score), half of which are threatened with extinction. Although ex-situ conservation efforts and applied research work are needed to safeguard and unlock the full potential of the local endemic NUPs evaluated herein, the proposed multifaceted evaluation scheme revealed that some local endemic NUPs of the studied regions can be sustainably exploited in short- or medium-term, following successful examples of Cretan NUPs e.g., <i>Origanum dictramnus</i>. The sustainable exploitation of high scored taxa of the studied regions can be fastened through targeted species-specific research bridging extant research gaps and facilitating conservation and stakeholder attraction."

"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the effect of placenta previa attached to cesarean scar for adverse pregnant outcomes in patients with or without placenta accreta spectrum disorders (PAS). <b>Methods:</b> The clinical information of patients with cesarean section history and placenta previa during the perioperative period at Peking University First Hospital from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2020 were collected retrospectively. There were 53 cases without PAS and 172 cases with PAS, 153 cases with abnormally invasive placenta (containing placenta increta and placenta percreta) and 72 cases without PAS or with placenta accreta. The pregnant outcomes including rate of postpartum hemorrhage, transfusion, hysterectomy between the above groups were compared. Multivariate analysis was performed to study the factors significantly associated with PAS. <b>Results:</b> Pregnant women with PAS were at higher risk of adverse pregnant outcomes than those without PAS. Patients with PAS had higher incidences of hysterectomy [12.2% (21/172) vs 0(0/53); <i>P</i>=0.005], postpartum hemorrhage [60.5% (104/172) vs 5.7% (3/53); <i>P</i>&lt;0.01] and blood transfusion [66.9% (115/172) vs 7.5% (4/53); <i>P</i>&lt;0.01]. In the subgroup analysis stratified by the type of PAS, patients with abnormally invasive placenta were at higher risk of hysterectomy [13.7% (21/153) vs 0 (0/72); <i>P&lt;</i>0.01], postpartum hemorrhage [66.7% (102/153) vs 6.9% (5/72); <i>χ</i>²<i>=</i>70.873, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01] and blood transfusion [74.5% (114/153) vs 6.9% (5/72); <i>χ</i>²<i>=</i>90.869, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01]. After multiple logistic regression, the type of creta had the positive relation with postpartum hemorrhage (<i>OR</i>=27.622, 95%<i>CI</i>:9.873~77.280; <i>P</i>&lt;0.01) and blood transfusion (<i>OR</i>=36.912, 95%<i>CI</i>:13.239~102.922; <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). There were no significant correlations between adverse pregnant outcomes and the type of placenta previa or the times of cesarean section (all <i>P</i>&gt;0.01). <b>Conclusions:</b> Placenta previa attached to cesarean scar without PAS or with placenta accreta could not act as the factor of predicting adverse pregnant outcomes in clinic. Placenta previa attached to cesarean scar with placenta increta or placenta percreta could increase the risk of adverse pregnant outcomes."

The Case of the Hospitals of Lasithi, Crete. 	Medication errors have been recognized as a real problem for all health systems worldwide and are the most common category of nursing errors. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of medication errors and their correlation with the job satisfaction of nurses. A prospective cross-sectional study was carried out and the sample of the study consisted of 189 nurses. To investigate medication errors, an anonymous structured questionnaire of 34 questions was used and Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS) questionnaire was used to measure job satisfaction. The IBM SPSS 25.0 program was used for statistical analysis of the data. 63.0% of nurses have been errors in the administration of medication, more often by the wrong time of administration (34.4%), missed dose (22.8%), and wrong dose (21.7%). The likelihood of an error is similar in all shifts, its devaluation is a non-reference reason, and if reported to a greater frequency in the attending physician. A significant difference in the frequency of errors was found only in the marital status and the job, while under the working conditions no significant variation was recorded. Job satisfaction is statistically significantly low for financial earnings and high for the management supervision. Based on the findings, the correlation between total job satisfaction and medication errors was not significant. Nursing medication errors continue to happen. Continuing education, formal recording, and improvement of working conditions could help prevent and minimize errors and at the same time increase the job satisfaction of nurses.

"Placenta percreta is described as the most severe grade of placenta accreta spectrum and accounts for a quarter of all cases of placenta accreta spectrum reported in the literature. We investigated the hypothesis that placenta percreta, which has been described clinically as placental tissue invading through the full thickness of the uterus, is a heterogeneous category with most cases owing to primary or secondary uterine abnormality rather than an abnormally invasive form of placentation. We have evaluated the agreement between the intraoperative findings using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification with the postoperative histopathology diagnosis in a prospective cohort of 101 consecutive singleton pregnancies presenting with a low-lying placenta or placenta previa, a history of at least 1 prior cesarean delivery and ultrasound signs suggestive of placenta accreta spectrum. Furthermore, a systematic literature review of case reports of placenta percreta, which included histopathologic findings and gross images, was performed. Samples for histologic examination were available in 80 of 101 cases of the cohort, which were managed by hysterectomy or partial myometrial resection. Microscopic examination showed evidence of placenta accreta spectrum in 65 cases (creta, 9; increta, 56). Of 101 cases included in the cohort, 44 (43.5%) and 54 (53.5%) were graded as percreta by observer A and observer B, respectively. There was a moderate agreement between observers. Of note, 11 of 36 cases that showed no evidence of abnormal placental attachment at delivery and/or microscopic examination were classified as percreta by both observers. The systematic literature review identified 41 case reports of placenta percreta with microscopic images and presenting symptomatology, suggesting that most cases were the consequence of a uterine rupture. The microscopic descriptions were heterogeneous, and all descriptions demonstrated histology of placenta creta rather than percreta. Our study supported the concept that placenta accreta is not an invasive disorder of placentation but the consequence of postoperative surgical remodeling or a preexisting uterine pathology and found no histologic evidence supporting the existence of a condition where the villous tissue penetrates the entire uterine wall, including the serosa and beyond."

"The EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of <i>Xylotrechus chinensis</i> (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) for the EU territory. This species is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. <i>X. chinensis</i> is native to China, Japan, the Korean peninsula and Taiwan. It has recently been reported from Spain (Catalonia; Region of Valencia), Greece (Athens; Crete) and France (Hérault; Gironde). <i>X. chinensis</i> attacks and kills <i>Morus</i> spp. in Europe and is also a pest of <i>Malus domestica</i>, <i>Pyrus</i> sp. and <i>Vitis vinifera</i> in Asia. This last species, however, was not confirmed as a host in an experimental study in Spain. The pest is univoltine. The adults are 1.5-2.5 cm long; they emerge between May and August. Each female produces approximately 80 eggs which are laid on the bark. The larvae live in the phloem and tunnel into the xylem where they pupate. Infested trees show injuries including longitudinal slits in the bark, caused by larval activity next to the surface and round exit holes from which frass emerges. The females respond to a male sex pheromone, which has not been developed into a detection method. The adults spread by flight as suggested by the local expansion of damage in Europe. However, wood packaging material and wooden objects can also be a pathway as suggested by interceptions in Germany and the USA. In Greece and Spain, hundreds of <i>Morus</i> trees have already been attacked within a few years, and often killed. The infested area has been observed to expand from 44 to 380 km<sup>2</sup> within 2 years in Spain (Catalonia). Phytosanitary measures are available to inhibit further introductions and slow the spread within the EU. <i>X. chinensis</i> satisfies all the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest."

The empirical material was derived from fieldwork notes, minutes from CFAP weekly meetings, and interviews provided by 13 CFAP members. Participants conceptualized the path from alcohol addiction to sobriety as a transition from a world of falsehood and deceit (""fractured reflexivity"") to a world of truth and communalism (""communicative reflexivity""). The article argues that CFAP's ""regime of truth"" prioritizes communicative reflexivity as the desirable mode of reflexivity, while at the same time contributing to an ambivalent political stance towards the oppressive structural arrangements that promote addiction."

A sub-sample of 117 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, <i>n</i> = 63) and cognitively non-impaired controls (CNI, <i>n</i> = 54) were recruited from a large, population-based cohort in Crete, Greece, of 3140 elders (&gt;60 years old). All participants underwent assessment of medical history/physical examination, extensive neuropsychiatric/neuropsychological evaluation, diet, three-day 24-h actigraphy, subjective sleep, physical activity, and measurement of IL-6 and TNFα plasma levels. Associations between inflammatory markers and diet, objective sleep duration, subjective sleep quality, and lack of physical activity were assessed using multivariate models. Regression analyses in the total group revealed significant associations between TNF-α and low vegetable consumption (<i>p</i> = 0.003), and marginally with objective long nighttime sleep duration (<i>p</i> = 0.04). In addition, IL-6 was associated with low vegetable consumption (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and lack of physical activity (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Poor diet and lack of physical activity appear to be modifiable risk factors of inflammation, whereas long sleep appears to be a marker of increased inflammatory response in elderly.

Here, we examine the role of genetic variation in shaping haematological traits in two isolated Mediterranean populations. Using whole-genome sequencing data at 22× depth for 1457 individuals from Crete (MANOLIS) and 1617 from the Pomak villages in Greece, we carry out a genome-wide association scan for haematological traits using linear mixed models. We discover novel associations (p &lt; 5 × 10<sup>-9</sup>) of five rare non-coding variants with alleles conferring effects of 1.44-2.63 units of standard deviation on red and white blood cell count, platelet and red cell distribution width. Moreover, 10.0% of individuals in the Pomak population and 6.8% in MANOLIS carry a pathogenic mutation in the Haemoglobin Subunit Beta (HBB) gene. The mutational spectrum is highly diverse (10 different mutations). The most frequent mutation in MANOLIS is the common Mediterranean variant IVS-I-110 (G&gt;A) (rs35004220). In the Pomak population, c.364C&gt;A (""HbO-Arab"", rs33946267) is most frequent (4.4% allele frequency). We demonstrate effects on haematological and other traits, including bilirubin, cholesterol, and, in MANOLIS, height and gestation age. We find less severe effects on red blood cell traits for HbS, HbO, and IVS-I-6 (T&gt;C) compared to other b+ mutations. Overall, we uncover allelic diversity of HBB in Greek isolated populations and find an important role for additional rare variants outside of HBB."

"	"Food residues are often fed to dogs in private households and might also be a potential ""new"" ingredient for pet food in the future. As food residues might contain not only digestible, but also fermentable substrates, an effect on the intestinal microbiota can be assumed. In the present study, two batches of dried food residues (DFR) collected from hotels in Crete were microbially fermented in an in vitro batch culture system with canine fecal inoculum: non-sterile DFR including meat (DFRm), sterile DFR including meat (DFRms) and sterile DFR without meat (DFRwms). Different non-digestible carbohydrate sources (beet pulp, wheat bran, inulin, carrot pomace, brewer´s spent grains, cellulose and lignocellulose) were included for comparison. Inulin, cellulose and lignocellulose were only used as raw materials, while the other test substrates were incubated as raw and enzymatically pre-digested substrates. After incubation for 24 hours, the raw food residues markedly increased the concentrations of bacterial metabolites in the fermenters, although smaller effects were observed for the DFRwms. When the enzymatically pre-digested food residues were incubated, the effects were more pronounced for the DFRms and DFRwms. In general, when compared with the other test substrates, the food residues were microbially fermented to a comparable or partly higher extent. Interestingly, high n-butyrate concentrations were measured in the inocula, both after incubation of the raw and pre-digested food residues. In conclusion, the food residues contained enzymatically digestible and microbially fermentable substrates. If considered as a potential future ingredient for pet food, a standardization of the collection and processing of food residues might be necessary in order to reduce compositional variability and varying effects on the intestinal microbiota."

The current COVID-19 crisis is having major impact on businesses across the world. This Insight focusses on investment in transport infrastructure as one of the key tools to enforce employment, businesses afloat and to maintain the productive capacity of the economy as well as maintain, and possibly increase, the attractiveness as business location. The challenges associated with the delivery and operation of complex transport infrastructure projects in today's marketplace have been well documented in recent years. Decision making in planning and management of new transport infrastructure projects is complicated due to the different stakeholders involved in decision process, especially for restricted economic conditions and financing assumptions, where the project business plan performance is strongly related to regional development prospects. The paper provides an evaluation framework based on an ex-ante assessment framework of a new airport economic impact concentration to business ecosystem on one hand and the diversity of economic impact to business ecosystem on the other in the post COVID-19 era. The approach is essential to provide key messages to national governments, decision makers and stakeholders regarding the contribution of an airport investment towards regional economic development in terms of contribution to business ecosystem after COVID-19 pandemic. The case study adopted to illustrate the application of this methodology is a new regional airport with high seasonal traffic characteristics on the island of Crete in Greece, one of the most attractive tourist destinations in South-east Mediterranean.

Hybridization is increasingly recognized as an important evolutionary force. Novel genetic methods now enable us to address how the genomes of parental species are combined in hybrid lineages. However, we still do not know the relative importance of admixed proportions, genome architecture and local selection in shaping hybrid genomes. Here, we take advantage of the genetically divergent island populations of Italian sparrow on Crete, Corsica and Sicily to investigate the predictors of genomic variation within a hybrid taxon. We test if differentiation is affected by recombination rate, selection, or variation in ancestry proportions. We find that the relationship between recombination rate and differentiation is less pronounced within hybrid lineages than between the parent species, as expected if purging of minor parent ancestry in low recombination regions reduces the variation available for differentiation. In addition, we find that differentiation between islands is correlated with differences in signatures of selection in two out of three comparisons. Signatures of selection within islands are correlated across all islands, suggesting that shared selection may mould genomic differentiation. The best predictor of strong differentiation within islands is the degree of differentiation from house sparrow, and hence loci with Spanish sparrow ancestry may vary more freely. Jointly, this suggests that constraints and selection interact in shaping the genomic landscape of differentiation in this hybrid species.

"In Greece vector borne diseases (VBD) and foremost West Nile virus (WNV) pose an important threat to public health and the tourist industry, the primary sector of contribution to the national economy. The island of Crete, is one of Greece's major tourist destinations receiving annually over 5 million tourists making regional VBD control both a public health and economic priority. Under the auspices of the Region of Crete, a systematic integrative surveillance network targeting mosquitoes and associated pathogens was established in Crete for the years 2018-2020. Using conventional and molecular diagnostic tools we investigated the mosquito species composition and population dynamics, pathogen infection occurrences in vector populations and in sentinel chickens, and the insecticide resistance status of the major vector species. Important disease vectors were recorded across the island including Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus, and Anopheles superpictus. Over 75% of the sampled specimens were collected in the western prefectures potentially attributed to the local precipitation patterns, with Cx. pipiens being the most dominant species. Although no pathogens (flaviviruses) were detected in the analysed mosquito specimens, chicken blood serum analyses recorded a 1.7% WNV antibody detection rate in the 2018 samples. Notably detection of the first WNV positive chicken preceded human WNV occurrence in the same region by approximately two weeks. The chitin synthase mutation I1043F (associated with high diflubenzuron resistance) was recorded at an 8% allelic frequency in Lasithi prefecture Cx. pipiens mosquitoes (sampled in 2020) for the first time in Greece. Markedly, Cx. pipiens populations in all four prefectures were found harboring the kdr mutations L1014F/C/S (associated with pyrethroid resistance) at a close to fixation rate, with mutation L1014C being the most commonly found allele (≥74% representation). Voltage gated sodium channel analyses in Ae. albopictus revealed the presence of the kdr mutations F1534C and I1532T (associated with putative mild pyrethroid resistance phenotypes) yet absence of V1016G. Allele F1534C was recorded in all prefectures (at an allelic frequency range of 25-46.6%) while I1532T was detected in populations from Chania, Rethymnon and Heraklion (at frequencies below 7.1%). Finally, no kdr mutations were detected in the Anopheles specimens included in the analyses. The findings of our study are of major concern for VBD control in Crete, highlighting (i) the necessity for establishing seasonal integrated entomological/pathogen surveillance programs, supporting the design of targeted vector control responses and; ii) the need for establishing appropriate insecticide resistance management programs ensuring the efficacy and sustainable use of DFB and pyrethroid based products in vector control."

Elevated basal cortisol levels in elderly may indicate dysregulation of the internal stress-related system, as well as dysfunction and structural alterations in brain structures necessary for cognition, such as hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Because of the close relation of executive functions and episodic memory processing, in this study we explored whether the association of elevated cortisol levels on episodic memory could be partly attributed to cortisol effects on executive functions. In this cross-sectional study we analyzed data from a sample of 236 community-dwelling older adults from the Cretan Aging Cohort aged 75.56 ± 7.21 years [53 with dementia due to probable Alzheimer's disease, 99 with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 84 cognitively non-impaired participants (NI)]. Morning serum cortisol levels were higher in the probable AD as compared to the NI group (p = .031). Mediated regression models in the total sample supported the hypothesis that the negative association of basal cortisol levels with delayed memory was fully mediated by the relation of basal cortisol levels with executive functions and immediate memory (adjusted for age and self-reported depression symptoms). Moderated mediation regression models revealed that the direct effect of cortisol on executive function and the effect of executive function on delayed memory performance were statistically significant among participants diagnosed with MCI, while the immediate memory effect on delayed memory was more pronounced in AD patients, as compared to the NI group. The current findings corroborate neuroimaging research highlighting cortisol effects on executive functions and immediate memory and further suggest that dysregulation of systems involved in these functions may account for the purported detrimental long-term effects of high cortisol levels on delayed memory.

A headspace-solid phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS) method was developed herein for the analysis of virgin olive oil volatile metabolome. Optimisation of SPME conditions was performed by Design of Experiments (DoE) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) approaches and factors, such as sample volume, sample stirring, extraction temperature and time, and desorption temperature and time, were examined to reach optimal microextraction conditions. The potential of the optimised method was then investigated for its use in the classification of Cretan virgin olive oil samples with the aid of multivariate statistical analysis. Certain markers were identified with significance in the geographical classification of Cretan extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples. In total, 92 volatile organic compounds were tentatively identified and semi-quantified, and the data obtained confirm that the method is robust, reliable, and analytically powerful for olive oil classification.

"Cesium-137, as the main fission product, is of special interest in the marine environment because of its solubility, which results to very low sinking time. Nevertheless, the conservative form of the main percentage of <sup>137</sup>Cs introduced in the marine environment (70%) makes <sup>137</sup>Cs to be included in the salinity of sea water. Based on this property, in this study, we examine potential relations between <sup>137</sup>Cs activity concentrations and marine parameters issued from Earth Observation (EO) data products in the Southern Aegean Sea, in order to investigate the possibility of <sup>137</sup>Cs to be recorded by satellite data. In particular, measurements of physical and biological marine parameters issued from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) database and MODIS ocean products are retrieved for the dates of <sup>137</sup>Cs field measurements. Single and multiple regression analyses are performed between the marine parameters and <sup>137</sup>Cs activity concentration measurements for three distinctive time periods (total, cold, and warm period). The best results are obtained from multiple regressions, one for each time period (r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.70). The models show that during cold period, <sup>137</sup>Cs activity concentrations are highly correlated to both chlorophyll and nutrients (phosphates) while during warm and the total period, they seem to be mainly correlated to the photosynthetic available incident solar radiation on the sea surface. For each period, we propose a multiparameter model linear in its parameters. Although the results of this study must be considered preliminary due to the limited size of the datasets, for the first time, we show that estimations of <sup>137</sup>Cs activity concentrations from EO measurements and CMEMS environmental models are feasible, and they can be used as a marine radiological assessment tool for a closed Mediterranean bay such as Souda Bay in Greece."

"Over the past decade, Greece and other Mediterranean countries have witnessed the emergence and resurgence of several vector-borne diseases (VBDs), posing important public health challenges and threatening the tourist industry. An essential prerequisite for the design and execution of efficient and sustainable context-specific VBD control programmes is the establishment of integrative entomological and epidemiological surveillance systems. However, the monitoring and management of surveillance datasets (often chronologically fragmented, scattered in regional health district offices and partially accessible upon requisition), as well as their transformation into actionable information, is a complex undertaking. In light of aiding and optimizing vector control efforts in the Mediterranean Basin, we developed VectorMap-GR, an online, open access, operational management tool for entomological and complementary epidemiological monitoring data. The tool's key components are a set of controlled vocabularies (ontologies) running throughout the system, the system's database and a map interface for data querying and display. The tool supports transformation of raw data into operationally relevant information (i.e. customized maps, charts, tables and reports) in a highly interactive fashion achieved through query filters and the ArcGIS technology embedded in the system. End-users may search for and obtain information on (i) the mosquito fauna composition, abundance and spatiotemporal dynamics; (ii) the mosquito insecticide resistance status and underlying resistance mechanisms; (iii) the occurrence of VBD pathogens and infections in vectors, animals and humans; and (iv) operationally relevant physical feature georeferenced datasets (e.g. mosquito breeding sites). VectorMap-GR was pilot implemented during 2018-2020 in a mosquito control programme in the Region of Crete (southern Greece). The programme's control efforts coupled with VectorMap-GR pilot implementation phase, very likely contributed to the reduction of vector population numbers and the prevention of human VBD occurrences, recorded in this period."

"High-mountain plant communities are strongly determined by abiotic conditions, especially low temperature, and are therefore susceptible to effects of climate warming. Rising temperatures, however, also lead to increased evapotranspiration, which, together with projected shifts in seasonal precipitation patterns, could lead to prolonged, detrimental water deficiencies. The current study aims at comparing alpine plant communities along elevation and water availability gradients from humid conditions (north-eastern Alps) to a moderate (Central Apennines) and a pronounced dry period during summer (Lefka Ori, Crete) in the Mediterranean area. We do this in order to (1) detect relationships between community-based indices (plant functional leaf and growth traits, thermic vegetation indicator, plant life forms, vegetation cover and diversity) and soil temperature and snow duration and (2) assess if climatic changes have already affected the vegetation, by determining directional changes over time (14-year period; 2001-2015) in these indices in the three regions. Plant community indices responded to decreasing temperatures along the elevation gradient in the NE-Alps and the Apennines, but this elevation effect almost disappeared in the summer-dry mountains of Crete. This suggests a shift from low-temperature to drought-dominated ecological filters. Leaf trait (Leaf Dry Matter Content and Specific Leaf Area) responses changed in direction from the Alps to the Apennines, indicating that drought effects already become discernible at the northern margin of the Mediterranean. Over time, a slight increase in vegetation cover was found in all regions, but thermophilisation occurred only in the NE-Alps and Apennines, accompanied by a decline of cold-adapted cushion plants in the Alps. On Crete, xeromorphic shrubs were increasing in abundance. Although critical biodiversity losses have not yet been observed, an intensified monitoring of combined warming-drought impacts will be required in view of threatened alpine plants that are either locally restricted in the south or weakly adapted to drought in the north."

"The identification of expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTMs), defined as associations between DNA methylation levels and gene expression, might help the biological interpretation of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). We aimed to identify autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood, using data from 832 children of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project. Blood DNA methylation and gene expression were measured with the Illumina 450K and the Affymetrix HTA v2 arrays, respectively. The relationship between methylation levels and expression of nearby genes (1 Mb window centered at the transcription start site, TSS) was assessed by fitting 13.6 M linear regressions adjusting for sex, age, cohort, and blood cell composition. We identified 39,749 blood autosomal cis eQTMs, representing 21,966 unique CpGs (eCpGs, 5.7% of total CpGs) and 8,886 unique transcript clusters (eGenes, 15.3% of total transcript clusters, equivalent to genes). In 87.9% of these cis eQTMs, the eCpG was located at &lt;250 kb from eGene's TSS; and 58.8% of all eQTMs showed an inverse relationship between the methylation and expression levels. Only around half of the autosomal cis-eQTMs eGenes could be captured through annotation of the eCpG to the closest gene. eCpGs had less measurement error and were enriched for active blood regulatory regions and for CpGs reported to be associated with environmental exposures or phenotypic traits. In 40.4% of the eQTMs, the CpG and the eGene were both associated with at least one genetic variant. The overlap of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood with those described in adults was small (13.8%), and age-shared cis eQTMs tended to be proximal to the TSS and enriched for genetic variants. This catalogue of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood can help the biological interpretation of EWAS findings and is publicly available at https://helixomics.isglobal.org/ and at Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.fxpnvx0t0).

"Constant exposure of health professionals to the pain and suffering of patients can adversely affect their emotional wellbeing. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence and the factors affecting the levels of secondary traumatic stress/compassion fatigue (STS/CF), burnout (BO) and compassion satisfaction (CS) of health professionals working in adult and paediatric Intensive Care Units (ICU) as well as in departments treating patients with serious illness in five hospitals in Crete. A descriptive cross-sectional survey with the use of the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL-CSF-R-IV) questionnaire. We enrolled medical, nursing and support staff working in the adult and paediatric ICU, emergency, oncology, haematology and neurosurgical departments, haemodialysis unit and operating theatre. 598 health professionals completed the questionnaire (response rate 73.2%). Significantly increased levels of STS/CF were observed in non - ICU as compared to ICU staff (p = .009) females compared to males (p &lt; .001), those who have previously experienced a traumatic event (p &lt; .004), nurses and support staff compared to doctors (p = .007 and p = .028 respectively), and people not working in a department by choice (p &lt; .001). CS was higher for older professionals, personnel subjected to stress reduction techniques (p &lt; .019) and professionals working with children or mixed adults and children population (p = .009). Rolling schedule and bad working conditions negatively affected CS (p = .02, p = .001). Increased BO levels were associated with younger age (p = .029) and showed a positive correlation with STS/CF (r = .356, p &lt; .001). STS/CF is common in health professionals regardless of their profession, working department or hospital level. Non-ICU staff displayed higher STS/CF levels. Working in a department by choice ameliorates CS, BO and STS/CF. Health professionals need to be informed about the risks of projecting patients' suffering on themselves. Hospital managers and department heads are responsible to provide appropriate support."

Modeling and forecasting spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation is crucial for managing water resources and mitigating water-related hazards. Globally valid spatiotemporal models of precipitation are not available. This is due to the intermittent nature, non-Gaussian distribution, and complex geographical dependence of precipitation processes. Herein we propose a data-driven model of precipitation amount which employs a novel, data-driven (non-parametric) implementation of warped Gaussian processes. We investigate the proposed warped Gaussian process regression (wGPR) using (i) a synthetic test function contaminated with non-Gaussian noise and (ii) a reanalysis dataset of monthly precipitation from the Mediterranean island of Crete. Cross-validation analysis is used to establish the advantages of non-parametric warping for the interpolation of incomplete data. We conclude that wGPR equipped with the proposed data-driven warping provides enhanced flexibility and-at least for the cases studied- improved predictive accuracy for non-Gaussian data.

"As placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) pathologies affect only the extremely thin tissues between the placenta and the uterine myometrium, superficial endometrial damage such as that caused by placenta creta and increta can be diagnosed only through histopathology. We performed direct uterine ultrasound of PAS using an ultrahigh frequency (33 MHz; i33LX9 Aplio i800) linear transducer. Here, we describe two cases with ultrasound images of placentas with PAS and a case without PAS to compare histological findings. In cases of PAS at the previous Cesarean scar, ultrasonography clearly revealed a thin uterine myometrium with some island-shaped sites where placental tissue was focally anchored to the uterine myometrium near the scar. Speckle blood flow pattern was absent at these sites during scanning with B-mode, but was detectable elsewhere. Histopathology samples from the same site revealed that villous tissue was directly attached to the uterine myometrium with a large area of infarction. In another case of diffuse PAS, speckle blood flow pattern was generally absent, and histopathology revealed deep fibrinoid deposits. We believe that histological evaluation following ultrasound use will improve the accuracy of ultrasound diagnosis and perinatal management of PAS in clinical practice."

Epitheliocystis is a fish gill disease caused by a broad range of intracellular bacteria infecting freshwater and marine fish worldwide. Here we report the occurrence and progression of epitheliocystis in greater amberjack reared in Crete (Greece). The disease appears to be caused mainly by a novel Betaproteobacteria belonging to the <i>Candidatus</i> Ichthyocystis genus with a second agent genetically similar to <i>Ca.</i> Parilichlamydia carangidicola coinfecting the gills in some cases. After a first detection of the disease in 2017, we investigated epitheliocystis in the following year's cohort of greater amberjack juveniles (cohort 2018) transferred from inland tanks to the same cage farm in the open sea where the first outbreak was detected. This cohort was monitored for over a year together with stocks of gilthead seabream and meagre co-farmed in the same area. Our observations showed that epitheliocystis could be detected in greater amberjack gills as early as a month following the transfer to sea cages, with ionocytes at the base of the gill lamellae being initially infected. Cyst formation appears to trigger a proliferative response, leading to the fusion of lamellae, impairment of gill functions and subsequently to mortality. Lesions are characterized by infiltration of immune cells, indicating activation of the innate immune response. At later stages of the outbreak, cysts were no longer found in ionocytes but were observed in mucocytes at the trailing edge of the filament. Whole cysts appeared finally to be expelled from infected mucocytes directly into the water, which might constitute a novel means of dispersion of the infectious agents. Molecular screening indicates that meagre is not affected by this disease and confirms the presence of previously described epitheliocystis agents, <i>Ca.</i> Ichthyocystis sparus, <i>Ca.</i> Ichthyocystis hellenicum and <i>Ca.</i> Similichlamydia spp., in gilthead seabream. Prevalence data show that the bacteria persist in both gilthead seabream and greater amberjack cohorts after first infection.

The Mediterranean Sea hosts two subduction systems along the convergent Africa-Eurasia plate boundary that have produced strong ground shaking and generated tsunamis. Based on historical descriptions and sedimentary records, one of these events, in 365 CE, impacted a broad geographical area, including tsunami evidence for distances of 700-800 km from the source event, qualifying it as a 'megatsunami'. Understanding how megatsunamis are produced, and where they are more likely, requires a better understanding of the different secondary processes linked to these events such as massive slope failures, multiple turbidity current generation, and basin seiching. Our sedimentary records from an extensive collection of cores located in distal and disconnected basins, identify turbidites which are analyzed using granulometry, elemental (XRF), micropaleontological, and geochemical data in order to reconstruct their coastal or marine source. The results show that the 365 CE basin floor sediments are a mixture of inner shelf and slope materials. The tsunami wave produced multiple far-field slope failures that resulted in stacked basal turbidites. It also caused transport of continent-derived organic carbon and deposition over basal turbidites and into isolated basins of the deep ocean. The composition of sediment in isolated basins suggests their deposition by large-scale sheet like flows similar to what has been caused by the Tohoku earthquake associated tsunamis. This is significant for rectifying and resolving where risk is greatest and how cross-basin tsunamis are generated. Based on these results, estimates of the underlying deposits from the same locations were interpreted as possible older megatsunamis.

In addition to tumor-inducing agrobacteria, non-pathogenic strains are often isolated from crown gall tumors. Such non-pathogenic strains sometimes contain catabolic plasmids that allow them to take advantage of the opines produced in the tumors. Here we characterize for the first time an octopine catabolic plasmid, pAtAg67, which is derived from an Agrobacterium strain isolated from a grapevine tumor in Crete. By sequence analysis, we deduce that pAtAg67 enables its host to catabolize not only octopine, but also cucumopine and agrocinopine-like compounds. We found that a highly similar set of catabolic genes was present in the Ti plasmids of tumorigenic octopine-cucumopine grapevine strains such as pTiAg57. However, the catabolic genes in octopine-cucumopine Ti plasmids were interrupted by a T-DNA segment. As no T-DNA remnants, virulence genes or border repeats were found in pAtAg67, catabolic plasmid pAtAg67 does not appear to be a degenerate octopine-cucumopine Ti plasmid. In line, plasmid pAtAg67 was found to be compatible with incRh1 octopine Ti plasmids, but to be incompatible with the incRh2 agropine Ti plasmid pTiBo542, forming cointegrates by recombination in the homologous trb genes.

"Pollen identification is an important task for the botanical certification of honey. It is performed via thorough microscopic examination of the pollen present in honey; a process called melissopalynology. However, manual examination of the images is hard, time-consuming and subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. In this study, we investigated the applicability of deep learning models for the classification of pollen-grain images into 20 pollen types, based on the Cretan Pollen Dataset. In particular, we applied transfer and ensemble learning methods to achieve an accuracy of 97.5%, a sensitivity of 96.9%, a precision of 97%, an F1 score of 96.89% and an AUC of 0.9995. However, in a preliminary case study, when we applied the best-performing model on honey-based pollen-grain images, we found that it performed poorly; only 0.02 better than random guessing (i.e., an AUC of 0.52). This indicates that the model should be further fine-tuned on honey-based pollen-grain images to increase its effectiveness on such data."

The rangelands of Crete island (Greece) are typical Mediterranean habitats under high risk of degradation due to long-term grazing and harsh climatic conditions. We explored the effect of abiotic (climatic conditions, altitude) and biotic factors (long-term grazing by small ruminants) on the floristic composition and diversity of selected lowland (Pyrathi, Faistos) and highland (Vroulidia, Nida) rangelands. In each rangeland, the ground cover was measured, and the floristic composition was calculated in terms of five functional groups: grasses, legumes, forbs, phrygana, and shrubs. The aridity index, species turnover, species richness, Shannon entropy, and Gini-Simpson index (with the latter two converted to the effective number of species) were calculated. Our results reveal that highlands are characterized by the highest aridity index (wetter conditions). Lowland rangelands, compared to highland, exhibited a higher percentage contribution of grasses, legumes, and forbs, while species turnover decreased along the altitudinal gradient. The Shannon entropy index was correlated (a) positively with Gini-Simpson and mean annual temperature and (b) negatively with mean annual precipitation, aridity index, and altitude. Moreover, the Gini-Simpson index correlated positively with mean annual temperature and negatively with altitude. Our results could help to understand the effects of grazing on rangeland dynamics and sustainability in semi-arid regions in the context of climatic change.

Sensitivity of B. cinerea to commonly used fungicides against Gray mold with emphasis to the newer quinone outside inhibitor (QoIs), and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) was assessed during a monitoring survey from vegetable greenhouses in four representative regions of Crete. 42% from a total of 168 isolates were simultaneously resistant to boscalid, fluopyram, pyraclostrobin and fenhexamid but not to fludioxonil making this phenylpyrrole fungicide an excellent anti-resistance antifungal agent. Isolates with double resistance to SDHIs and QoIs were found in very high frequencies indicating a selection towards double resistance due to the use of pyraclostrobin-boscalid mixtures. A number of sdhB resistance mutations (H272R, N230I and P225F/H) were found in isolates also carrying the G143A cytb resistance mutation in the above isolates. A novel sdhB point mutation (I274V) was identified for the first time in B. cinerea isolates collected from greenhouses with a fluopyram spray history with specific resistance to SDHIs. A PCR-RFLP diagnostic assay was developed for the detection of this mutation in the sdhB gene. Mutations P225F/H and I274V were found to be associated with fitness penalties in terms of mycelial growth, sporulation or pathogenicity. Results suggest that, in order to retain effective control of gray mold in Crete, appropriate anti-resistance strategies should be implemented taking into account the high double SDHI and QoI resistance frequencies. Additional studies for monitoring the already known and the new SDHI-resistance mutations, are necessary in order to hinder the further spread and establishment of single or double resistant isolates of B. cinerea detected in greenhouses in Crete.

To design context-driven strategies, we studied CRD-related beliefs, perceptions, and behaviors among a Greek Roma population, focussing on asthma and COPD. For this qualitative study in Crete, Greece, we used a Rapid Assessment Process. We conducted interviews and focus groups with purposively selected Roma community members (CMs), key informants (KIs) and healthcare professionals (HPs) serving the population. Data were triangulated using observations of households and clinical consultations. Key themes were identified using Thematic Content Analysis. The Health Belief Model, the Explanatory Model of Illness, and the Theory of Planned Behavior that are complementary is some aspects, guided our methodology with the several variables from them to be integrated to better understand CRD risk preventative behavior. We conducted six focus groups, seven interviews and 13 observations among 15 CMs, four KIs, and three HPs. Five themes emerged: (1) Poor CRD-awareness (smoking and household air pollution were perceived as harmful, but almost exclusively associated with acute rather than chronic symptoms); (2) Low perceived susceptibility to CRD (and CMs tended to ignore respiratory symptoms); (3) High risk exposure (smoking was common, and air pollution was perceived inevitable due to financial constraints); (4) Healthcare seeking (healthcare was sought only for persistent, severe symptoms, daily needs were a priority); (5) Perceived barriers/facilitators to care (health illiteracy, perceived discrimination and financial constraints were main barriers; established trust the main facilitator). These five themes highlight that strategies to tackle CRD in the studied Roma setting require a multilevel approach: bridging awareness gaps at the population level, providing resources to enhance the adoption of healthy behaviors, and fighting discrimination at the societal level, whilst establishing trusted relationships at the local level. Similar methodologies to address local context may strengthen the implementation of effective interventions for similarly vulnerable and/or low-resource populations."

Prosodic aspects of cross-linguistic contact are under-researched, especially past contact that has subsequently ceased. In this paper, we investigate declarative and polar question tunes of contemporary Cretan Greek, a regional variety of Greek whose speakers were in contact with Venetian speakers during the four and half centuries of Venetian rule on the island, from 1204 to 1669. The F0 contours of the Cretan tunes and alignment of peaks and troughs of interest with the nuclear vowel are compared to the corresponding tunes in Venetian dialect and Venetian Italian and to those in Athenian (Standard) Greek, which are used as control. The data (1610 declarative utterances and 698 polar questions) were drawn from natural speech corpora based on pragmatic criteria: broad focus for declaratives, broad focus, and information-seeking interpretation for polar questions. The pitch contour shapes of the tunes are modeled using polynomial basis functions, and the F0 alignment points are determined analytically. The results show the robustness of contact effects almost three and a half centuries after regular contact ceased and indicate that the shapes of the F0 contours of Cretan and Venetian declarative and polar question tunes are similar. In addition, Cretan alignment patterns are similar to Venetian and significantly different from Athenian. Insights are gained from research into how long prosodic characteristics may persist in a recipient language-decades or even centuries after the cessation of contact.

Drawing upon empirical evidence from a research carried out at the University of Crete, this paper investigates the social sciences students' perception towards their experiences regarding the emergency online learning amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The study reveals aspects of digital divides, as well as divergent perceptions of students, ranging from techno-philic attitudes that enthusiastically welcome the pivot to online learning, to ambivalent opinions expressing moderate satisfaction and techno-sceptic views, criticising pandemic pedagogies through digitalised forms of learning. The analysis sheds light on the contextual factors associated with the dystopic condition of the protracted economic crisis and the pandemic, that lie behind the claims of many students, revealing a main tension between contrasting perceptions of digital education. Students with positive attitudes towards online learning tend to highlight the advantages in regard to time and space flexible modalities of digital education, embracing it as an inclusive practice that responds to the social and educational needs of students, especially at times of crisis. Techno-sceptic attitudes criticise online learning models fοr lowering the academic standards, separating students from the real-life world on campus and repositioning them in digital settings where common physical experience, affective body language and classroom socialisation are missing. The article offers insight in the ongoing discussion of the emergency remote learning and underlines the political and pedagogical significance of the accelerating digitalisation of the universities in the post-COVID era.

"An ethnobotanical field study focusing on traditional wild greens (WGs) was carried out in Central Crete, Greece. Through thirty-one semi-structured interviews, a total of fifty-five wild green plants and their culinary uses and linguistic labels were documented; they were mostly consumed boiled (<i>vrasta</i>) or fried (<i>tsigariasta</i>), as a filling for homemade pies. Comparison with some Greek historical data of the 19th and 20th centuries showed that WGs have remained resilient and are still present in the current Cretan diet. Cross-cultural comparison with the WGs gathered and consumed in other areas of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean demonstrated a remarkable diversity of Cretan WGs and important similarities with those consumed in Greek-speaking Cyprus, the Bodrum area of Turkey, coastal Syria, and Southern Italy. We discussed the cognitive categories linked to <i>Chorta</i>, as well as the possible origin of an original ""bulk"" of post-Neolithic food weeds that could have spread from the Fertile Crescent westwards across the Mediterranean basin over a few millennia. The current study represents a crucial effort to document and preserve the bio-cultural gastronomic heritage of <i>Chorta</i> and it is advisable that both biology and history scholars, as well as policy makers, pay needed attention to the WGs of the Cretan and Mediterranean diet."

"Our study aimed to distinguish patients with placenta accreta (crete, increta, and percreta) from those with placenta previa using maternal plasma levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PLGF) and the sFlt-1/PLGF ratio. We obtained maternal plasma from 185 women in late pregnancy and sorted them into three groups: 72 women with normal placental imaging results (control group), 50 women with placenta previa alone (PP group), and 63 women with placenta previa and placenta accreta (PAS group). The concentrations of sFlt-1 and PLGF in the maternal plasma were measured using ELISA kits and the sFlt-1/PLGF ratio was calculated. The median (min-max) sFlt-1 levels and the sFlt-1/PLGF ratio in the PAS group (12.8 ng/ml, 3.8-34.2 ng/ml) (133, 14-361) were lower than in the PP group (28.7 ng/ml, 13.1-60.3 ng/ml) (621, 156-2013) (p &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively). The median (min-max) PLGF levels in the PAS group (108 pg/ml, 38-679 pg/ml) was higher than that in the PP group (43 pg/ml, 12-111 pg/ml) (p &lt; 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). The area under the ROC of the sFlt-1 levels, PLGF levels, and sFlt-1/PLGF ratio were 0.91, 0.90, and 0.99, respectively; the cut-off values were 18.9 ng/ml, 75.9 pg/ml, and 229.5, respectively. The concentration of sFlt-1 and sFlt-1/PLGF ratio were associated with the volume of blood loss (-.288*, -.301*). The concentrations of sFlt-1 and PLGF and ratio of plasma sFlt-1/PLGF may distinguish patients with placenta accreta from those with placenta previa."

"Dysphagia is defined as any feeding or swallowing dysfunction at one or more stages of digestion. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of dysphagia symptoms in children and adolescents with neurological disorders and its relationship with the specific characteristics of the subjects. Using data from general hospital/paediatric department visits in Heraklion, Crete, Greece, a cross-sectional study design was implemented over a seven-month period (2017-18), and a total of 268 children and adolescents were recruited. Demographic data and medical profiles were recorded, focusing on the most obvious and frequent clinical features of feeding and swallowing disorders per stage (oral-OS, pharyngeal-PS, and oesophageal-ES). In the sample, 54.9% were boys and the mean age was 5.9 years; the most prevalent International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) disorder was mental and behavioural disorders (37.3%). The prevalence of dysphagia symptoms was 24.3% during the OS (95% CI: 19.0-29.9), 18.3% in the PS (95% CI: 14.0-23.2), and 20.1% in the ES (95% CI: 15.7-25.4). At least one symptom of dysphagia was observed during the OS, PS, and ES in 42.5% (95% CI: 36.7-48.5) of the sample. The presence of dysphagia seems to be related to lower age (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.45, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), higher ICD-10 comorbidity (OR = 1.89, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), or medication use (OR = 2.31, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). A high prevalence of dysphagia was found in children and adolescents with neurological disorders, while lower age, comorbidity, and medication use emerged as factors that required better management."

Four novel strains were isolated: PWU4<sup>T</sup> and PWU20<sup>T</sup> were both from soil in Germany, PWU5<sup>T</sup> was isolated from soil in India and PWU37<sup>T</sup> was obtained from sheep faeces collected on the Island of Crete. Cells of each were observed to be Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, rod shaped, and to grow optimally between 28 and 34 °C, between pH 7.0 and 8.0 and without the addition of NaCl. The strains were found to be catalase and oxidase-negative and able to grow on most mono- and disaccharides, a few polysaccharides and organic acids. Their predominant menaquinone was identified as MK-7. Their major fatty acids were identified as C<sub>16:1</sub> ω7c (PWU4<sup>T</sup> and PWU20<sup>T</sup>) and C<sub>16:1</sub> ω5c (PWU5<sup>T</sup> and PWU37<sup>T</sup>). The DNA G + C contents of strains PWU4<sup>T</sup>, PWU20<sup>T</sup>, PWU5<sup>T</sup> and PWU37<sup>T</sup> were determined to be 50.2 mol%, 51.6 mol %, 39.8 mol% and 53.8 mol%, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the close relatives Ohtaekwangia koreensis 3B-2<sup>T</sup> and Ohtaekwangia kribbensis 10AO<sup>T</sup> share less than 93.8% sequence similarity. The strains were classified in two groups, where PWU4<sup>T</sup> and PWU20<sup>T</sup> share 93.0% sequence similarity, and PWU5<sup>T</sup> and PWU37<sup>T</sup> share 97.5% sequence similarity. However, the members of each group were concluded to represent different species based on the low average nucleotide identity (ANI) of their genomes, 69.7% and 83.8%, respectively. We propose that the four strains represent four novel species of two new genera in the family Cytophagaceae. The type species of the novel genus Chryseosolibacter is Chryseosolibacter histidini gen. nov., sp. nov. with the type strain PWU4<sup>T</sup> (= DSM 111594<sup>T</sup> = NCCB 100798<sup>T</sup>), whilst strain PWU20<sup>T</sup> (= DSM 111597<sup>T</sup> = NCCB 100800<sup>T</sup>) is the type strain of a second species, Chryseosolibacter indicus sp. nov. The type species of the novel genus Dawidia is Dawidia cretensis gen. nov., sp. nov. with the type strain PWU5<sup>T</sup> (= DSM 111596<sup>T</sup> = NCCB 100799<sup>T</sup>), whilst strain PWU37<sup>T</sup> (= DSM 111595<sup>T</sup> = NCCB 100801<sup>T</sup>) is the type stain of a second species, Dawidia soli sp. nov.

The EFSA Panel on Plant Health conducted a pest categorisation of Capsicum chlorosis virus (CaCV) for the EU territory. The identity of CaCV, a member of the genus <i>Orthotospovirus</i> (family <i>Tospoviridae</i>), is established and reliable detection and identification methods are available. The pathogen is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. CaCV has been reported in Australia, China, India, Iran, Taiwan, Thailand and USA (Hawaii). In the EU, it has been reported once in Greece (Crete Island). The NPPO of Greece reported that CaCV is no longer present in Greece. CaCV infects plant species in the family Solanaceae (i.e. pepper, tomato) and several species of other families, including ornamentals. It may induce severe symptoms on its hosts, mainly on leaves and fruits, which may become unmarketable. The virus is transmitted in a persistent propagative mode by the thrips <i>Ceratothripoides claratris, Frankliniella schultzei, Microcephalothrips abdominalis</i> and <i>Thrips palmi. C. claratris</i> and <i>T. palmi</i> are EU quarantine pests. <i>M</i>. <i>abdominalis</i> is known to be present in several EU member states and it is not regulated in the EU. Plants for planting, parts of plants, fruits and cut flowers of CaCV hosts, and viruliferous thrips were identified as the most relevant pathways for the entry of CaCV into the EU. Cultivated and wild hosts of CaCV are distributed across the EU. Should the pest enter and establish in the EU territory, impact on the production of cultivated hosts is expected. Phytosanitary measures are available to prevent entry and spread of the virus in the EU. CaCV fulfils the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.

"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) appears to have a higher prevalence in diabetics and has been associated with various genetic polymorphisms of the innate immune system. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the <i>C1q</i> gene that encodes for the trigger molecule of the classical complement pathway increase the risk of bacterial infections as well as other diseases. In the present study, we sought to investigate the association of <i>C1q</i> rs292001 (G &amp;gt; A) SNP with ASB in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). <i>Materials and Methods</i>: In this case-control study, performed at the University and the Venizeleion General Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, 75 adult male and female Cretan patients with T2D and ASB and 75 adult male and female Cretan patients with T2D but without ASB were enrolled and genotyped for rs292001 SNP of <i>C1q</i> gene. Genetic analysis was based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RLFPs) methods. <i>Results</i>: Τhe frequency of homozygotes for the G/G genotype of <i>C1q</i> rs292001 was significantly higher in patients with T2D and ASB than in the control group (<i>p</i>-value = 0.0480, OR = 2.952, 95% CI: 1.052-7.542). <i>Conclusions</i>: Τhe present study provides the first evidence of an association between the <i>C1q</i> rs292001 SNP and an increased susceptibility for ASB in an adult Cretan population with T2D, thus suggesting that this SNP can be encountered as a risk factor for the presence of ASB in patients with T2D."

"In late March 2018, a large part of the Eastern Mediterranean experienced an extraordinary episode of African dust, one of the most intense in recent years, here referred to as the ""Minoan Red"" event. The episode mainly affected the Greek island of Crete, where the highest aerosol concentrations over the past 15 yeas were recorded, although impacts were also felt well beyond this core area. Our study fills a gap in dust research by assessing the multi-sectoral impacts of sand and dust storms and their socioeconomic implications. Specifically, we provide a multi-sectoral impact assessment of Crete during the occurrence of this exceptional African dust event. During the day of the occurrence of the maximum dust concentration in Crete, i.e. March 22nd, 2018, we identified impacts on meteorological conditions, agriculture, transport, energy, society (including closing of schools and cancellation of social events), and emergency response systems. As a result, the event led to a 3-fold increase in daily emergency responses compare to previous days associated with urban emergencies and wildfires, a 3.5-fold increase in hospital visits and admissions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations and dyspnoea, a reduction of visibility causing aircraft traffic disruptions (eleven cancellations and seven delays), and a reduction of solar energy production. We estimate the cost of direct and indirect effects of the dust episode, considering the most affected socio-economic sectors (e.g. civil protection, aviation, health and solar energy production), to be between 3.4 and 3.8 million EUR for Crete. Since such desert dust transport episodes are natural, meteorology-driven and thus to a large extent unavoidable, we argue that the efficiency of actions to mitigate dust impacts depends on the accuracy of operational dust forecasting and the implementation of relevant early warning systems for social awareness."

The aim of this paper is the creation of an integrated and free-access web platform for parcel irrigation water management on a large spatial scale (Water District of Crete, in Greece) in order to: a) accurately determine the irrigation needs of the main crops for Crete such as olives, citrus, avocados and vineyards, b) design strategies, for optimal adaptation of the agricultural sector in the context of climate change, and c) incorporate the dynamic integration of the above information through the creation of a digital platform. In the proposed decision-making system, essential factors are taken into account, such as real-time meteorological data, information about the type and spatial distribution of the agricultural parcels in Crete, algorithms for calculation crop evapotranspiration per development stage and age of the crops, satellite remote sensing techniques in combination with field surveys to depict accurate soil texture map for the whole island of Crete as well as sustainable cultivation practices for saving water per crop and parcel geomorphology. Based on the proposed decision-making system, users will have the opportunity in any specific location/farm in Crete to know the irrigation needs of the crops in real-time and obtain information about proper climate-water adaptation practices. The main novelty points of the proposed platform include the derivation of parcel-level soil texture data from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and field samples, the comprehensiveness of the irrigation management information, the relatively low data requirements and the application interface simplicity provided to the end-user.

Type 2 inflammation underlies the chronicity of disease in subgroups of patients with asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and atopic dermatitis (AD), that often co-exist. Although several studies have investigated the unmet needs of asthma, AD and CRSwNP as such, little is known about the similarities and differences in experiences and perspectives of the current management of patients with comorbid Type 2 inflammatory diseases. To improve insight into the common and organ-specific needs of patients with Type 2 inflammation and comorbidities, allowing the formulation of recommendations to better address these needs in the future. This qualitative study was conducted between July 2021 and December 2021 using semi-structured face-to-face or telephone interviews with patients suffering from year-long severe chronic Type 2 inflammation and at least one co-morbid inflammatory condition. Seven participating academic centers in Europe interviewed asthma (Copenhagen and Leuven), CRSwNP (London, Amsterdam and Crete) and/or AD (Oldenburg and Zurich) patients on patient characteristics, disease severity, shortcomings of current care pathways and suggestions for improvement of care. Transcripts were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis approach. Eighty-one patients with severe Type 2 inflammation and comorbidities were interviewed. Similar needs were recognized by patients with Type 2 inflammation, with both a lack of coordination in care and a lack of a real cure reported as being most frustrating. However, several needs are specific to asthma, CRSwNP and AD. Suggestions for improvement of care were generic across diseases, such as the implementation of a multidisciplinary approach, the improved facilitation of access to better treatments, the increase of general awareness on disease burden, and better educational programs for healthcare providers and patients. Of note, patients with CRSwNP also stated the need for alternatives to sinus surgery, whereas patients with asthma requested better medical care to prevent exacerbations and patients with AD would warmly welcome the reimbursement of emollients. Patients with asthma, CRSwNP and AD have shared unmet needs that need to be addressed by physicians, the academic community and health policy makers. This survey provides unique recommendations made by patients for the implementation of better care.

In recent years, researchers and policymakers have emphasised the importance of understanding the complex relationships between Water, Energy, Food and Ecosystems (WEFE). The primary reason for capturing these complexities is to understand how decisions made in the water, food and energy sectors can affect one another. Crucially, biodiversity and ecosystem services (E) play a mediating role in these relationships by making material and non-material contributions to all other sectors (W, E, F). The Nexus approach has been widely used for capturing these interdependencies and identifying opportunities for increasing efficiency, reducing trade-offs and building synergies for sustainable resource use across the WEFE nodes. One challenge in using this framework is the need to harmonise the technical and managerial dimensions of the WEFE interlinkages with the perceptions and priorities of local populations directly involved in the use and management of resources. This paper presents a methodological framework that seeks to integrate the perspectives of experts, practitioners and local stakeholders on the WEFE Nexus through the combined application of the Delphi and Focus Group methods. In this paper, the municipality of Apokoronas in Crete, Greece has served as the case in point. The combined framework allowed us to explore the Nexus understanding at the local level and was instrumental in the identification of initiatives for more integrated resource management. The triangulation of results captured the differences in priorities between practitioners and the local community at large, but also, more specifically, it pointed to discrepancies within groups and across WEFE sectors. The outcomes of this paper demonstrate that awareness and learning play a central role in Nexus actions to overcome conflicts and perceived inequalities, and to internalise solutions. The inclusion of the ecosystems node in the traditional WEF Nexus encouraged participants to contemplate the pivotal role of ecosystems in supporting the rest of the WEF sectors.

A coupled hydrodynamic/lagrangian particle drift model was applied to obtain the distribution of key radionuclides that are dispersed at the surface water (upper 100 m) of Eastern Mediterranean Sea, in case of an accident of Nuclear Power Plant at Akkuyu. The model was applied to simulate the dispersion of key artificial radionuclide concentration, in case of a hypothetical accident to assess issues related to sea health and potential hazards. The released radionuclide was found to have a favorable westward direction, following the prevailing currents. The variability of the predicted pattern is interpreted according to the near surface circulation patterns in the study area. The dispersion of key radionuclides (<sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>238</sup>Pu and <sup>131</sup>I) was studied in a spatial and temporal manner at the neighboring coasts of the location of the NPP. Furthermore, the fate of the plume was predicted for each month after the accident date close to the areas of Akkuyu, namely Cyprus, Rhodes Island, North Cretan coast, Cyclades and Syrian Coast. The annual study revealed that the radioactive plume is present with high concentration (maximum values of 1200 Bq m<sup>-3</sup> for the long lived isotopes and 600 Bq m<sup>-3</sup> for <sup>131</sup>I) in the location of the plant for short period of time (1-2 months), while the other areas are affected during the whole year with low level of activity concentration (20-50 Bqm<sup>-3</sup>). The ERICA Assessment Tool was also used to evaluate dose rates to common marine biota at the studied areas.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the adapted Cyprus Greek Lexical List a-CYLEX (GR) in a sample of 194 Greek toddlers from the island of Crete with Standard Modern Greek (SMG) as their primary language. The a-CYLEX (GR) is a parental report checklist for assessing the receptive and expressive vocabulary skills of children aged 12 months to 3:6 years. Concurrent validity of the instrument was tested via correlations with the adapted Greek version of the Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test-II (ROWPVT-II), which was administered to 124 SMG-speaking children between the ages of 2 and 3:6 years. Test-retest reliability was tested by administering the instrument two times within a 2-week interval to 59 parents (30.41% of the total sample). Statistical analyses provided strong evidence for the high internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the a-CYLEX (GR). The role of the demographic variables in vocabulary performance and the frequency of each a-CYLEX (GR) word category by age were also investigated. In conclusion, the a-CYLEX (GR) is a parental report checklist that can be used by clinicians who are interested in assessing receptive and expressive vocabulary of children during toddlerhood.

During the late 3<sup>rd</sup> millennium BCE, the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East witnessed societal changes in many regions, which are usually explained with a combination of social and climatic factors.<sup>1-4</sup> However, recent archaeogenetic research forces us to rethink models regarding the role of infectious diseases in past societal trajectories.<sup>5</sup> The plague bacterium Yersinia pestis, which was involved in some of the most destructive historical pandemics,<sup>5-8</sup> circulated across Eurasia at least from the onset of the 3<sup>rd</sup> millennium BCE,<sup>9-13</sup> but the challenging preservation of ancient DNA in warmer climates has restricted the identification of Y. pestis from this period to temperate climatic regions. As such, evidence from culturally prominent regions such as the Eastern Mediterranean is currently lacking. Here, we present genetic evidence for the presence of Y. pestis and Salmonella enterica, the causative agent of typhoid/enteric fever, from this period of transformation in Crete, detected at the cave site Hagios Charalambos. We reconstructed one Y. pestis genome that forms part of a now-extinct lineage of Y. pestis strains from the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age that were likely not yet adapted for transmission via fleas. Furthermore, we reconstructed two ancient S. enterica genomes from the Para C lineage, which cluster with contemporary strains that were likely not yet fully host adapted to humans. The occurrence of these two virulent pathogens at the end of the Early Minoan period in Crete emphasizes the necessity to re-introduce infectious diseases as an additional factor possibly contributing to the transformation of early complex societies in the Aegean and beyond.

"The present study aims to explore the association of maternal sleep disturbances during late pregnancy on child neuropsychological and behavioral development in preschool years. The study included 638 mother-child pairs from the prospective Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece. Information on antenatal sleep disturbances was collected through a computer-assisted interview. Children's neuropsychological and behavioral development was assessed using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA), the Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Test (ADHDT), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Multivariate analysis showed that maternal sleep duration less than 8 h was associated with reduced scores in the general cognitive scale (β = -2.28, 95% CI -4.54, -0.02, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.417) and memory span (β = -3.24, 95% CI -5.72, -0.77, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.304), while mild-severe daytime sleepiness was associated with reduced scores in the memory scale (β = -5.42, 95% CI -10.47, -0.37, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.304), memory span (β = -5.44, 95% CI -10.68, -0.21, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.304), nd functions of posterior cortex (β = -5.55, 95% CI -10.40, -0.70, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.393) of MSCA. Snoring in late pregnancy was related to higher child hyperactivity scores in SDQ (β = 1.05, 95% CI 0.16, 1.95, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.160). An interaction between child sex and maternal sleep duration in response to ADHD symptoms was also found (p for interaction &lt; 0.05). Stratified analysis revealed increased hyperactivity, inattention, and ADHD total scores for girls of mothers with sleep duration less than 8 h. Maternal sleep disturbances during pregnancy may be associated with impaired child neuropsychological and behavioral development during the preschool years. Early detection and intervention is necessary to reduce sleep disturbances habits in pregnancy and improve child neurodevelopment."

Isotope and DNA analysis of human mobility in Bronze Age Crete. 	We undertook a large-scale study of Neolithic and Bronze Age human mobility on Crete using biomolecular methods (isotope analysis, DNA), with a particular focus on sites dating to the Late Bronze Age ('Late Minoan') period. We measured the strontium and sulphur isotope values of animal remains from archaeological sites around the island of Crete to determine the local baseline values. We then measured the strontium and sulphur values of humans from Late Neolithic and Bronze Age sites. Our results indicate that most of the humans have sulphur and strontium isotope values consistent with being local to Crete, showing no evidence for a wide-scale movement of people from the Greek mainland or other areas away from Crete in these time periods. However, we found four individuals from the late Bronze Age (Late Minoan III) cemetery of Armenoi with sulphur isotope values not typically found in Crete and are instead consistent with an origin elsewhere. This cemetery at Armenoi also has one of only a few examples of the newly adopted Mycenaean Linear B script on Crete found outside of the palace sites, pointing to an influence (trade and possible migration) from the mainland, which may then be the place of origin of these four individuals. DNA (mtDNA) studies of eight Late Bronze Age individuals from Armenoi have results consistent with people living in Aegean region at this time and cannot be used to distinguish between individuals from Crete ('Minoans') and the Greek mainland ['Mycenaeans']).

Population connectivity studies are a useful tool for species management and conservation planning, particular of highly threatened or endangered species. Here, we evaluated the genetic structure and connectivity pattern of the endangered coral <i>Cladocora caespitosa</i> across its entire distribution range in the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, we examined the relative importance of sexual and asexual reproduction in the studied populations and their genetic diversity. A total of 541 individuals from 20 localities were sampled and analysed with 19 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Of the genotyped individuals, 482 (89%) had unique multilocus genotypes. Clonality percentages of the populations varied from 0% (in eight populations) to nearly 69% (in one population from Crete). A heterozygosity deficit and a high degree of inbreeding was the general trend in our data set. Population differentiation in <i>C. caespitosa</i> was characterised by significant pairwise <i>F</i> <sub><i>ST</i></sub> values with lower ones observed at an intraregional scale and higher ones, between populations from different biogeographic regions. Genetic structure analyses showed that the populations are divided according to the three main sub-basins of the Mediterranean Sea: the Western (Balearic, Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas), the Central (Adriatic and Ionian seas) and the Eastern (Levantine and Aegean seas), coinciding with previously described gene flow barriers. However, the three easternmost populations were also clearly separated from one another, and a substructure was observed for the other studied areas. An isolation-by-distance pattern was found among, but not within, the three main population groups. This substructure is mediated mainly by dispersal along the coastline and some resistance to larval movement through the open sea. Despite the low dispersal ability and high self-recruitment rate of <i>C. caespitosa</i>, casual dispersive events between regions seem to be enough to maintain the species' considerable genetic diversity. Understanding the population connectivity and structure of this endangered scleractinian coral allows for more informed conservation decision making.

To investigate whether mild forms of placenta creta (MPC) are more common in placentas delivered by cesarean section for non-anatomical indications than in placentas from vaginal deliveries. This is a retrospective clinical study in which MPC was diagnosed histologically by the presence of myometrial fibers in the decidua basalis or parietalis or in direct contact with the Rohr fibrinoid or chorionic villi. After excluding 111 cases at high risk for anatomical PC, placentas from 830 consecutive cesarean deliveries (group 1) were retrospectively statistically compared with 907 placentas from vaginal deliveries (group 2). Statistically significant differences were found in six independent clinical and seven placental phenotypes. More frequently, pre-eclampsia, abnormal fetal heart rate tracing and umbilical artery Dopplers, hypercoiled umbilical cord, diffuse postuterine pattern of chronic hypoxic placental injury, and clusters of avascular or mineralized chorionic villi were found in group 1, while preterm delivery, induction of labor, and histological patterns related to stillbirth were observed in group 2. MPC diagnosed in placentas from cesarean sections performed for non-anatomical indications is not statistically significantly more common than in those after vaginal delivery. Therefore, MPC may feature similar diagnostic correlations and portend a similar prognosis for future pregnancies.

This paper takes a practice-based approach to the study of cultural identity, focusing on how raw material and technical choices involved in the production of quotidian tools served to both reproduce, and reflect a social group's very way of being. We then consider the (dis)continuity of obsidian blade-making traditions from Middle-Late Bronze Age Malia (north-central Crete), i.e., before and after a period of island-wide destructions, and appearance of foreign elements believed to reflect the arrival of a population from the Greek mainland (Mycenaeans). Methodologically this involves an integrated, 'thick description' obsidian characterisation study to detail long-term cultural traditions, including the use of Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) to source the raw materials of 36 artifacts. The results show a significant degree of continuity in the community's lithic traditions, suggesting that many of the innovative features at Malia can be interpreted in terms of local factions appropriating new and foreign means of social distinction, rather than wholescale changes in community composition.

"The extensive use of antibiotics in livestock farming poses increased concerns for human health as residues of these substances are present in edible tissues. The aim of this study was the determination of the levels of four groups of antibiotics (sulfonamides-SAs, tetracyclines-TCs, streptomycines-STr and quinolones-QNLs) in meat samples (muscles, livers and kidneys from beef, chicken and pork) and the estimation of the dietary exposure to antibiotics from meat consumption and the potential hazard for human health. Fifty-four samples of raw meat were randomly collected in 2018 from the Cretan market, Greece and analyzed both with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). According to the results derived from the ELISA method, only 2% of the meat samples were free from antibiotics, 2% were detected with 4 antibiotics and the great majority of the samples (87%) were detected with 2 to 3 antibiotics. SAs presented the highest detection frequencies for all samples whereas TCs were not detected in any bovine sample. The highest median concentration was detected for STr in bovine muscles (182.10 μg/kg) followed by QNLs (93.36 μg/kg) in pork kidneys whereas the chicken samples had higher burdens of QNLs compared to the other meat samples. LC-MS analysis showed that oxytetracycline (OTC) was the most common antibiotic in all samples. The highest median concentration of all antibiotics was detected for doxycycline (DOX) (181.73 μg/kg in pork kidney) followed by OTC in bovine liver (74.46 μg/kg). Risk characterization was applied for each of the two methods; The hazard quotients (HQ) did not exceed 0.059 for the ELISA method and 0.113 for the LC-MS method for any group of antibiotics, whereas the total hazard indexes (HI) were 0.078 and 0.021, respectively. The results showed the presence of different groups of antibiotics in meat from the Cretan market and that the health risk to antibiotics is low. A risk assessment analysis conducted for meat consumption and corrected for the aggregated exposure revealed no risk for the consumers."

"Liver cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in Europe and Greece. An increase in specific risk factors, such as metabolic syndrome and obesity, has been observed in Greece. Therefore, exploring temporal trends of liver cancer incidence and mortality is crucial. This study aims to assess the ""burden"" of malignant liver tumors (MLT) in Crete, Greece, in terms of incidence and mortality rates, and identify the high-risk areas on the island (i.e., municipalities), to suggest public health measures. Data were obtained from the Cancer Registry Center (CRC) and included all cases of MLT for the period 1992-2013 in Crete. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR), age-specific incidence rates (ASpIR), age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), and age-specific mortality rates (ASpMR) were estimated. For the study period (1992-2013), incidence and mortality showed an increasing trend. Mean ASIR was found 15.3/100,000/year and mean ASMR 8.6/100,000/year. Age groups 65-69 and 75-79 years among men presented the highest rates of (ASIR = 39/100,000/year) and among women age groups of 75-79 and 80-84 years a mean ASIR (22/100,000/year). The five-year survival rate of MLT was 50% and the ten-year survival rate was 47% for both genders. Risk factors that were identified included personal history of cancer, family history of MLT or other cancer, degree of relationship, smoking, and obesity. Some municipalities of Crete were found to be high-risk areas for MLT, while differences were detected in incidence and mortality rates, and annual rate change among them. Estimated variation indicates further increase probably due to the lifestyle of the residents, economic crisis, and inadequate preventive measures."

Recent discovery of ectopic repeats (outside CRISPR arrays) provided unprecedented insights into the nondefense roles of CRISPR-Cas. A striking example is the addiction module CreTA (CRISPR-regulated toxin-antitoxins), where one or two (in most cases) ectopic repeats produce CRISPR-resembling antitoxic (CreA) RNAs that direct the CRISPR effector Cascade to transcriptionally repress a toxic RNA (CreT). Here, we demonstrated that CreTA repeats are extensively degenerated in sequence, with the first repeat (ψR1) being more diverged than the second one (ψR2). As a result, such addiction modules become highly specific to their physically-linked CRISPR-Cas loci, and in most cases, CreA could not harness a heterologous CRISPR-Cas to suppress its cognate toxin. We further disclosed that this specificity primarily derives from the degeneration of ψR1, and could generally be altered by modifying this repeat element. We also showed that the degenerated repeats of CreTA were insusceptible to recombination and thus more stable compared to a typical CRISPR array, which could be exploited to develop highly stable CRISPR-based tools. These data illustrated that repeat degeneration (a common feature of ectopic repeats) improves the stability and specificity of CreTA in protecting CRISPR-Cas, which could have contributed to the widespread occurrence and deep diversification of CRISPR systems.

This work compares four different image processing algorithms for the analysis of image data obtained during the Multiscale Boiling Experiment of ESA, executed on-board the International Space Station. Two separate experimental campaigns have been performed in 2019 and 2020, aiming to investigate boiling phenomena in microgravity, with and without the presence of shear flow and electric field. A heated substrate, at the bottom of the test cell, creates a temperature profile across the liquid bulk above it. A laser beam hits a designated microcavity at the middle of the substrate, to initiate nucleation of a single, isolated bubble. In the presence of shear flow or electric field forces, the bubble slides or detaches respectively, leaving the cavity free for the nucleation and growth of a new bubble. The growth of such a bubble within the prescribed temperature profile is studied for varying experimental conditions (i.e. pressure, heat flux, subcooling temperature) by capturing high speed, black and white video images. The presence of light reflections at random locations around the bubble contour vary with bubble size and population. This, combined with the refraction induced optical distortion of vertical image dimension close to the heater, make the accurate detection of bubbles contour a real challenge. Four research teams, namely the University of Pisa (UNIPI), the Institute of Fluid Mechanics of Toulouse (IMFT), the joint group of Aix Marseille University (AMU) and Kutateladze Institute of Thermophysics (IT), and the joined group of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), Technical University of Darmstadt (TUD) and Foundation of Research and Technology in Crete (FORTH), developed separate specialized algorithms to: a) detect bubble edges and b) use these edges to calculate basic bubble geometrical features, such as contact line diameter, bubble diameter and contact angles. These four different approaches diverge in complexity and concept. In the absence of reference measurements at microgravity conditions, measurements efficiency is evaluated based on the comparison of the estimated bubble geometrical features along with pertinent physical arguments. Results show that the efficiency of each approach varies with the nature of measurement. The studied benchmark dataset is published allowing other research groups to test further their own image processing algorithms.

This profile scheme is an indicative categorization summarizing the crucial features that popular apps possess and can help parents and/or educators' decision-making on choosing the desirable application for their kids. Moreover, from an independent evaluation of these specific fifty apps sought on the internet, the members of Cluster2/Profile 2 were the most popular and preferable, as suggested by the number of downloads.

"Insecticide resistance has developed in several populations of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci worldwide and threatens to compromise the efficacy of chemical control. The molecular mechanisms underpinning resistance have been characterized and markers associated with the trait have been identified, allowing the development of diagnostics for individual insects. TaqMan and Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) assays were developed and validated, in individual and pooled whitefly samples, respectively, for the following target-site mutations: the acetylcholinesterase (ace1) F331W mutation conferring organophosphate-resistance; the voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) mutations L925I and T929V conferring pyrethroid-resistance; and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acc) A2083V mutation conferring ketoenol-resistance. The ddPCR's limit of detection (LoD) was &lt;0.2% (i.e. detection of one heterozygote whitefly in a pool of 249 wild-type individuals). The assays were applied in 11 B. tabaci field populations from four locations in Crete, Greece. The F331W mutation was detected to be fixed or close to fixation in eight of 11 B. tabaci populations, and at lower frequency in the remaining ones. The pyrethroid-resistance mutations were detected at very high frequencies. The A2083V spiromesifen resistance mutation was detected in eight of 11 populations (frequencies = 6.16-89.56%). Spiromesifen phenotypic resistance monitoring showed that the populations tested had variable levels of resistance, ranging from full susceptibility to high resistance. A strong spiromesifen-resistance phenotype-genotype (A2083V) correlation (r<sub>s</sub>  = -0.839, P = 0.002) was observed confirming the ddPCR diagnostic value.

"Iuridae is a family of scorpions that exhibits a highly complex biogeographic and taxonomic history. Iuridae taxa are mainly found in Turkey and Greece, whereas a single species is found in northern Iraq. Several taxonomic revisions have been conducted on this family that initially comprised two genera. The latest taxonomic review, based on morphological and anatomical features, raised the number of Iuridae genera to four, and the number of species to 14. Sequence data from three molecular markers (COX1, 16S rDNA, ITS1) originating from numerous Iuridae taxa were analyzed within a phylogenetic framework. Divergence time-estimate analyses, species delimitation approaches and estimation of ancestral areas were implemented in order to: (1) reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the Iuridae taxa, (2) evaluate the morphological classifications, and (3) obtain insights into the biogeographic history of the family in the East Mediterranean. The multi-locus phylogeny clearly confirms an ancient division into two clades, Calchinae and Iurinae. Ancient patterns of isolation and dispersal are revealed. Both subfamilies are largely confined to the Anatolian peninsula and its few coastal islands; only the most derived genus Iurus has dispersed westward to Crete and Peloponnese. Based on our findings, three new genera of Iurinae (Metaiurus, Anatoliurus, and Letoiurus) are established. The genus Neocalchas emerges as one of the most ancient scorpion clades, with divergence time about 27 mya."

A description of similar new species from CreteH. cretensis sp. nov., formerly known as H. cf. gisini sensu Ellis (1976), is also provided. Both species belong to the manubrialis group and resemble H. breviempodialis (Stach, 1949), H. tianshanica Martynova, 1970 and H. ubsunurensis Babenko, 1999, which have a retinaculum with 3 + 3 teeth and a maxillary head of the H. vernalis type. H. gisini has a unique combination of morphological characters: claws without inner tooth, empodium shorter than half inner edge of claw, without basal lamella and setae m1 on abdominal tergum V usually absent. This species prefers sandy habitats on the shores of the Baltic Sea, Kattegat, North Sea, Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea. H. cretensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from its congeners by a combination of the following features: claws with small inner tooth, empodium with basal lamella equal to or slightly longer than half of the inner edge of claws and setae m1 on abdominal tergum V usually present. The new species seems to be associated with anthropogenic habitats mainly (e.g. roadsides, orchards, meadows) in the interior of Crete.

"Our goal was to study hereditary transthyretin-related amyloidosis (hATTR) in Crete, Greece. We aimed at ascertaining all hATTR cases in Crete, an island of 0.62 million people. For this, we evaluated patients with polyneuropathy, autonomic involvement, cardiomyopathy, and/or ophthalmopathy suggestive of hATTR, who presented to the physicians of this study or were referred to them by other physicians. Genetic analyses were performed on all patients suspected of suffering from hATTR. We included in our observational longitudinal cohort study all individuals, residents of Crete, who, during the study period (1993-2019), were found to carry a pathogenic <i>TTR</i> variant. Over the past 27 years, 30 individuals (15 female patients, 15 male patients), from 12 apparently unrelated families, were diagnosed with hATTR, whereas evaluation of their offspring identified 5 asymptomatic <i>TTR</i> pathogenic variant carriers. The most prevalent <i>TTR</i> variant detected was p.Val50Met, affecting 19 patients (11 female patients, 8 male patients) and causing a rather consistent phenotype characterized by predominant polyneuropathy of early adult onset (median age of symptom onset: 30 years; range: 18-37 years). Specifically, patients affected by the p.Val50Met <i>TTR</i> variant experienced progressive sensorimotor disturbances, involving mainly the lower extremities, associated with autonomic and/or gastrointestinal dysfunction. The second most frequent <i>TTR</i> variant was p.Val114Ala, found in 10 patients (4 female patients, 6 male patients) who were affected at an older age (median age of symptom onset: 70 years; range: 54-78 years). This variant caused a predominantly cardiomyopathic phenotype, manifested by congestive heart failure and associated with peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, and/or autonomic involvement. In these patients, cardiac amyloid deposition was detected on 99m-technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy and/or heart biopsy. The third <i>TTR</i> variant (p.Arg54Gly) was found in a 50-year-old male patient with ophthalmopathy due to vitreous opacities and positive family history for visual loss. As 22 patients were alive at the end of the study, we calculated the hATTR prevalence in Crete to be 35 cases per 1 million inhabitants.

Three different pathogenic <i>TTR</i> variants causing distinct clinical phenotypes were identified in this relatively small population pool."

A fish kill was recorded at the Aposelemis Dam, which is the main reservoir of drinking water for the island of Crete in Greece. Hundreds of goldfish were found dead at a side stream which provides water to the reservoir. The affected fish had been entrapped in a small pond at the side of the stream with practically zero water renewal as the event occurred in August which is a dry season for the island of Crete. The event was alarming for the local community since anthropogenic pollution was initially suspected which could pose a significant human health threat. Following examination of the fish, the mortality was attributed to heavy infection by the parasitic flagellate, Ichthyobodo sp., whilst no pollutants were detected. The parasite was studied through light and scanning electron microscopy and was identified molecularly.

"Using exome sequencing, we analyzed 196 participants of the Cretan Aging Cohort (CAC; 95 with Alzheimer's disease [AD], 20 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 81 cognitively normal controls). The APOE ε4 allele was more common in AD patients (23.2%) than in controls (7.4%; p &lt; 0.01) and the PSEN2 p.Arg29His and p.Cys391Arg variants were found in 3 AD and 1 MCI patient, respectively. Also, we found the frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-associated TARDBP gene p.Ile383Val variant in 2 elderly patients diagnosed with AD and in 2 patients, non CAC members, with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/FTD phenotype. Furthermore, the p.Ser498Ala variant in the positively selected GLUD2 gene was less frequent in AD patients (2.11%) than in controls (16%; p &lt; 0.01), suggesting a possible protective effect. While the same trend was found in another local replication cohort (n = 406) and in section of the ADNI cohort (n = 808), this finding did not reach statistical significance and therefore it should be considered preliminary. Our results attest to the value of genetic testing to study aged adults with AD phenotype."
PMID:36126026	Manning SW	PLoS One. 17(9):e0274835	2022	Second Intermediate Period date for the Thera (Santorini) eruption and historical implications. 	The historical relevance of the Thera (Santorini) volcanic eruption is unclear because of major dating uncertainty. Long placed ~1500 BCE and during the Egyptian New Kingdom (starts ~1565-1540 BCE) by archaeologists, 14C pointed to dates ≥50-100 years earlier during the preceding Second Intermediate Period. Several decades of debate have followed with no clear resolution of the problem-despite wide recognition that this uncertainty undermines an ability to synchronize the civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean in the mid-second millennium BCE and write wider history. Recent work permits substantial progress. Volcanic CO2 was often blamed for the discrepancy. However, comparison of 14C dates directly associated with the eruption from contemporary Aegean contexts-both on and remote from Thera-can now remove this caveat. In turn, using Bayesian analysis, a revised and substantially refined date range for the Thera eruption can be determined, both through the integration of the large 14C dataset relevant to the Thera eruption with the local stratigraphic sequence on Thera immediately prior to the eruption, and in conjunction with the wider stratigraphically-defined Aegean archaeological sequence from before to after the eruption. This enables a robust high-resolution dating for the eruption ~1606-1589 BCE (68.3% probability), ~1609-1560 BCE (95.4% probability). This dating clarifies long-disputed synchronizations between Aegean and East Mediterranean cultures, placing the eruption during the earlier and very different Second Intermediate Period with its Canaanite-Levantine dominated world-system. This gives an importantly altered cultural and historical context for the New Palace Period on Crete and the contemporary Shaft Grave era in southern Greece. In addition, the revised dating, and a current absence of southern Aegean chronological data placed soon afterwards, highlights a period of likely devastating regional eruption impact in the earlier-mid 16th century BCE southern Aegean.

Both healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial resistance are associated with an increased length of stay and hospital costs, while they have also been linked to high morbidity and mortality rates. In 2016 and 2017, the latest point prevalence survey (PPS) of HAIs and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals highlighted an HAI prevalence of 6.5%, while Greece had a higher HAI prevalence of 10%. The aim of this PPS was to record the prevalence of HAIs and antimicrobial use in all eight public acute care hospitals in Crete, Greece during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to highlight the types of infections and antimicrobial practices that need to be prioritized for infection control initiatives. The PPS was conducted between 30 March and 15 April 2022, according to the ECDC standardized relevant protocol (version 5.3). Statistics were extracted using the ECDC Helics.Win.Net application (software version 4.1.0). A total of 1188 patients were included. The overall point prevalence of patients with at least one HAI was 10.6%. The most frequent types of infections were pneumonia (34.3%), bloodstream infections (10.5%), systemic infections and urinary tract infections (10.5% and 9.1%, respectively). In 14 (12.4%) cases, the pathogen responsible for HAI was SARS-CoV-2 following onsite spread, accounting for almost 10% of all HAIs. Microorganisms were identified in 60.1% of HAIs. Antimicrobials were administered in 711 (59.8%) patients, with 1.59 antimicrobials used per patient. The prevalence of HAI and antimicrobial use among hospitalized patients in Crete, Greece was similar to the national HAI prevalence in 2016 despite the enormous pressure on public hospitals due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, both HAI prevalence and antimicrobial use remain high, underlining the need to implement adequate infection control and antimicrobial stewardship interventions.

"Bacterial antibiotic resistance (AMR) is a significant threat to public health, with the sentinel 'ESKAPEE' pathogens, being of particular concern. A cohort study spanning 5.5 years (2016-2021) was conducted at a provincial general hospital in Crete, Greece, to describe the epidemiology of ESKAPEE-associated bacteraemia regarding levels of AMR and their impact on patient outcomes. In total, 239 bloodstream isolates were examined from 226 patients (0.7% of 32 996 admissions) with a median age of 75 years, 28% of whom had severe comorbidity and 46% with prior stay in ICU. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was lowest for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (30%) and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (33%), and highest among <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (97%); the latter included 8 (22%) with extensive drug-resistance (XDR), half of which were resistant to all antibiotics tested. MDR bacteraemia was more likely to be healthcare-associated than community-onset (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04-2.65). Inpatient mortality was 22%, 35% and 63% for non-MDR, MDR and XDR episodes, respectively (<i>P</i> = 0.004). Competing risks survival analysis revealed increasing mortality linked to longer hospitalisation with increasing AMR levels, as well as differential pathogen-specific effects. <i>A. baumannii</i> bacteraemia was the most fatal (14-day death hazard ratio 3.39, 95% CI 1.74-6.63). Differences in microbiology, AMR profile and associated mortality compared to national and international data emphasise the importance of similar investigations of local epidemiology."

"Patients with atypical mole syndrome (AMS) have a 3- to 20-fold higher risk of developing malignant melanoma (MM) than individuals without. The most modifiable risk factor for developing MM is the ongoing ultraviolet exposure. To assess awareness, knowledge, and attitudes towards sun protection among patients with MM and AMS. From January 2020 till December 2021, a written survey was administered to patients with MM and AMS and a control group who attended a specialist mole clinic at the Dermatology Department of the University Hospital of Heraklion in Heraklion, Crete, Greece. Demographic data and photoprotective practices, knowledge, and perceived barriers were collected. Relevant statistical analyses were performed using SPSS IBM 25. In total, 121 subjects consented and participated in the survey. Their mean age was 43.92 ± 12.55 years. There were 66 (54.4%) females and 55 (45.4%) males. Forty-seven (38.8%) patients had AMS, 26 (21.5%) had a past medical history of MM, and 48 (39.7%) attended the clinic for a full skin checkup for their naevi without having AMS or MM. Although 104 (86%) participants reported using sunscreen with the majority of them (59/121 = 48.8%) wearing sunscreen with a sun protection factor of &gt; 50, only 22 (18.2%) patients did so every day and only 20 (16.5%) all year round. Approximately 74.4% of patients recalled having received advice on how to protect their skin from sunlight, and 73% were interested in receiving education about sun protection. The most mentioned barriers in photoprotection were concerns over adequate vitamin D and lack of time. Despite mentioning having received adequate education in photoprotection, adherence to photoprotection practices is suboptimal in patients with MM and AMS."

"(1) Background: There is evidence in the recent literature that the incidence patterns of colorectal cancer (CRC) have changed considerably over the years, tending to rise rapidly in individuals under 50 years old compared with those over 50 years. The current study aimed to assess the incidence of CRC in Crete from 1992-2021 and compare them among younger and older adults. (2) Methods: Data on malignant neoplasms of colon, rectosigmoid junction, and rectum have been extracted from the database of the Regional Cancer Registry of Crete. (3) Results: The number of these cases for the period 1992-2021 was 3857 (<i>n</i> = 2895 colon and <i>n</i> = 962 rectum). The mean age-specific incidence rate (ASpIR/100,000/year) of colon cancer patients &amp;lt;50 years was 7.2 (95% CI 5.1-9.7), while for patients ≥50 years the ASpIR was 149 (95% CI 146.2-153.4). ASpIR presented a 29.6% increase from 2001 to 2011 in the age group of 20-34 years and further increase is expected from 2022-2030 (projected change, 42.8%). The main risk factors were the pack years (<i>p</i> = 0.01), alcohol consumption (0.02), and farmer occupation (0.04), especially during 2012-2021. (4) Conclusions: We confirmed an increased incidence of CRC in young adults &amp;lt;50 in a European population with low cancer incidence in the past and a worrisome prediction for the near future. The observed trends clearly indicate that starting CRC screening at an earlier age may be essential."

Economic or Health Crisis?	"(1) Background: This is the first population-based study in Greece, with the aim to measure the changing trends of lung cancer (LC) and the associated risk factors before and after the economic crisis. Among the main objectives were the identification of LC hot spots and high-risk areas; (2) Methods: The study was conducted in Crete, the biggest island in Greece. Data (5057 LC cases) were collected from the Cancer Registry of Crete (CRC). The age-standardized incidence and mortality rates (ASIR, ASMR/100,000/year) were estimated, while additional indexes were used, including the adjusted Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI%), the deprivation index (HPI-2), and the exposure to outdoor air pollution (OAP). The analysis was performed for two time periods (Period A: 1992-2008; Period B: 2009-2013); (3) Results: ASIR presented a significant increase during the economic crisis, while an even higher increase was observed in ASMR (Period A: ASMR = 30.5/100,000/year; Period B: ASMR = 43.8/100,000/year; <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). After 2009, a significant increase in the observed LC hot spots was identified in several sub-regions in Crete (<i>p</i> = 0.04). The risk of LC mortality increased even more for smokers (RR = 5.7; 95%CI = 5.2-6.3) and those living in highly deprived geographical regions (RR = 5.4; 95%CI = 5.1-5.8) during the austerity period. The multiple effect of LC predictors resulted in adjusted RRs ranging from 0.7 to 5.7 within the island (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05); (4) Conclusions: The increased LC burden after the onset of the economic crisis, along with a changing pattern of LC predictors stressed the urgent need of geographically oriented interventions and cancer control programs focusing on the most deprived or vulnerable population groups."

We aimed to develop an evidence-based cancer-oriented conceptual collection of methods for spatial analysis; (2) Methods: A triangulation of approaches was used; literature review, consensus meetings (expert panel), and testing the selected methods on ""training"" databases. The literature review was conducted in three databases. This approach guided the development of a collection of methods that was subsequently commented on by the expert panel and tested on ""training data"" of cancer cases obtained from the Cancer Registry of Crete based on three epidemiological scenarios: (a) low prevalence cancers, (b) high prevalence cancers, (c) cancer and risk factors; (3) Results: The final spatial epidemiology conceptual collection of methods covered: data preparation/testing randomness, data protection, mapping/visualizing, geographic correlation studies, clustering/surveillance, integration of cancer data with socio-economic, clinical and environmental factors. Some of the tests/techniques included in the conceptual collection of methods were: buffer and proximity analysis, exploratory spatial analysis and others. All suggested that statistical models were found to fit well (R2 = 0.72-0.96) in ""training data""; Conclusions: The proposed conceptual collection of methods provides public health professionals with a useful methodological framework along with recommendations for assessing diverse research questions of global health."

The seagrass <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> forms extensive meadows in the Mediterranean Sea. Studies on their associated highly diverse invertebrate assemblages are limited to the western Mediterranean. The eastern Mediterranean, however, is a basin undergoing rapid change due to the synergistic effects of climate warming, biological invasions and other human stressors that are driving native biodiversity to regional-scale collapses. We here surveyed the shelled molluscan assemblage of a <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> meadow in Plakias, south-western Crete, the first such study in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. This area has increased its yearly mean temperature by 1 °C in the last 20 years and is under heavy pressure by Lessepsian species. We sampled across a 5- to 20-m depth gradient, in two seasons to capture intra-annual variation and the leaf and rhizome strata separately. Against our expectations, the molluscan assemblage proved to be highly diverse, with species richness, dominant species and trophic guilds comparable to healthy western Mediterranean ones, and with a negligible non-indigenous component. The diversity of the native community (following the biotic resistance hypothesis) and oxygen supersaturation in the meadow may cause greater resistance to biological invasions and warming, respectively, suggesting that <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> meadows may act as a precious refugium for native biodiversity in the fast changing eastern Mediterranean Sea.

Microplastics are substrates for microbial activity and can influence biomass production. This has potentially important implications in the sea-surface microlayer, the marine boundary layer that controls gas exchange with the atmosphere and where biologically produced organic compounds can accumulate. In the present study, we used six large scale mesocosms to simulate future ocean scenarios of high plastic concentration. Each mesocosm was filled with 3 m<sup>3</sup> of seawater from the oligotrophic Sea of Crete, in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. A known amount of standard polystyrene microbeads of 30 μm diameter was added to three replicate mesocosms, while maintaining the remaining three as plastic-free controls. Over the course of a 12-day experiment, we explored microbial organic matter dynamics in the sea-surface microlayer in the presence and absence of microplastic contamination of the underlying water. Our study shows that microplastics increased both biomass production and enrichment of carbohydrate-like and proteinaceous marine gel compounds in the sea-surface microlayer. Importantly, this resulted in a ∼3 % reduction in the concentration of dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> in the underlying water. This reduction was associated to both direct and indirect impacts of microplastic pollution on the uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> within the marine carbon cycle, by modifying the biogenic composition of the sea's boundary layer with the atmosphere.

The impact of otter trawling on the relationship between functional traits of benthic invertebrates and specific biogeochemical processes were investigated in the oligotrophic Cretan Sea. The fishery is managed through a seasonal closure during the summer. During two seasons (winter and summer) replicate samples were taken from the field from a commercial trawl ground and an adjacent control area. Environmental parameters related to sediment biogeochemistry were measured including particulate organic carbon, sedimentary organic carbon, bottom water and sedimentary chlorophyll a and phaeopigment concentrations as well as benthic oxygen consumption. A significant impact of trawling was recorded only for bottom water chlorophyll and sedimentary organic carbon. Furthermore, the links between species traits and specific ecosystem processes were affected by trawling, highlighting the importance of unique functional modalities on ecosystem functioning. The traits that mostly influenced benthic biogeochemistry in the control sites were related to bioturbation and burrowing activities. In contrast, in the trawled sites, the associated traits were related to more opportunistic lifestyles and deposit feeding species that do not act as bioturbators. Thus, under trawling disturbance, this shift can decouple the species-sediment relations and affect nutrient cycling.

"To evaluate frailty and its relationship with geriatric syndromes in the context of socioeconomic variables. In this cross-sectional study, elderly people aged 65 years old and over who received homecare in the reference region of Crete, Greece, were enrolled. Geriatric syndromes such as frailty, dementia, and depression were evaluated using the SHARE-Frailty Index (SHARE-Fi), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), respectively. Level of education, annual individual income, disability in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and homebound status were also assessed as 'socioeconomic factors.' The mean age of 301 participants was 78.45 (±7.87) years old. A proportion of 38.5% was identified as frail. A multiple logistic regression model revealed that elderly people with cognitive dysfunction were more likely to be frail (OR = 1.65; 95% CI: 0.55-4.98, <i>p</i> = 0.469) compared to those with normal cognition, but this association was not significant. Although elderly people with mild depression were significantly more likely to be frail (OR = 2.62; CI: 1.33-5.17, <i>p</i> = 0.005) compared to those with normal depression, the association for elderly people with severe depression (OR = 2.05, CI: 0.80-5.24, <i>p</i> = 0.134) was not significant. Additionally, comorbidity (OR = 1.06, CI: 0.49-2.27, <i>p</i> = 0.876) was not associated with frailty, suggesting that comorbidity is not a risk factor for frailty. In addition, patients with mild depression were significantly more likely to report frailty (OR = 2.62, CI:1.33-5.17, <i>p</i> = 0.005) compared to those with normal depression, whereas elders with an annual individual income (&amp;gt;EUR 4500) were less likely to be frail (OR = 0.45, CI: 0.25-0.83, <i>p</i> = 0.011) compared to those with &amp;lt;EUR 4500 per year. Our data analysis shows that higher annual individual income and mild depression were independently associated with frailty, suggesting that a lower poverty threshold and mild depression are risk factors for frailty."

"Breast cancer incidence is rising globally, while mortality rates show a geographical heterogenous pattern. Early detection and treatment have been proven to have a profound impact on breast cancer prognosis. The aim of his study was to compare breast cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates in two contrasting corners of Europe, Sweden and Crete, to better understand cancer determinants with focus on disease burden and sociocultural factors. Breast cancer data from Sweden and Crete was derived from registries. Incidence and mortality were expressed as Age-Standardized Incidence Rates (ASIR), Age-Standardized Mortality Rates (ASMR). Breast cancer incidence has for decades risen in Sweden and on Crete. In 2019, ASIR was 217.5 in Sweden and 58.9 on Crete, (p &lt; 0.001). Mortality rates showed opposite trends. ASMR in Sweden was reduced from 25.5 to 16.8 (2005-2019) while on Crete, ASMR increased from 22.1 to 25.3. A successive rise in survival rate in Sweden with a 5-year survival rate of 92% since 2015, but a converse development on Crete with 85% 5-year survival rate the same year. The incidence of breast cancer is slowly rising in both studied regions, but mortality increases on Crete in contrast to Sweden with sinking mortality rates. The interpretation of these findings is that differences in health care systems and health policies including differences in early detection like screening programs and early treatment, as well as sociocultural factors in the two countries might play an important role on the differences found in breast cancer burden."

In our new interpretation, the Trachilos succession is Late Pliocene and part of a shallowing marine series that became subaerially exposed some 3 millions of years ago. Placed in a larger geological context, Crete was an island during the Late Pliocene and separated by ~ 100 km of open sea from the nearest European mainland, and therefore out of reach of Late Pliocene hominins.

"In Greece, the implementation of the Water Framework Directive for rivers is based mainly on benthic macroinvertebrates and uses a semi-quantitative method with a D-frame net, which is certified by the International Organization for Standardization. Before the official adoption of this method, a quantitative shovel sampler (""Cretan shovel"") was used in southern Greece (Crete), which has been implemented for almost three decades due to the specific river habitats found in Crete (e.g., seasonal flow, narrow riverbeds, and coarse substrates). In this study, we compared community metrics, diversity indices, feeding groups, locomotion types, and ecological quality derived from data collected using timed semi-quantitative kick samples and quantitative shovel samples collected from the same sites simultaneously. In total, 20 samples from the north and south of Greece were collected. The majority of community metrics, diversity indices, and traits were comparable between samplers. However, there were statistically significant differences in the relative abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, passive filterers' and the (semi) sessil groups, and Pielou's index. Most differences in the ecological quality between the kick and shovel samples were observed in 50% of the sites in northern Greece because the shovel is less effective at capturing motile zoobenthos. The ecological quality assessment in Crete by the Cretan shovel is comparable with the D-frame net in 75% of the samples. Thus, the Cretan shovel could efficiently sample the Cretan streams, which are characterized by coarse, narrow, turbulent, and hydrologically fluctuating river habitats. Such comparisons could improve sampling effectiveness and make additional data available to assess ecological quality."

"Abnormal placentation is a spectrum disorder that includes creta, increta, and percreta; the term placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) disorders is used as a broad term to describe all of these conditions. PAS can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. The predictive value of cervical length (CL) in patients with PAS remains controversial. Thus, this study investigated the relationship between CL and the probability of major bleeding in patients with PAS and placenta previa. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a comprehensive tertiary hospital in Chongqing, China, between January 2018 and December 2020. The target independent and dependent variables were CL and intraoperative massive bleeding, respectively. The covariates included demographic, clinical, and ultrasound characteristics. Logistic regression was used to explore the association between CL and massive bleeding. In total, 317 participants were enrolled, in whom the prevalence of massive bleeding was 41.9% (133/317). The threshold of CL associated with massive bleeding (≥1,000 ml) was 33 mm based on a receiver operating characteristic curve. In the fully adjusted model for each additional unit of CL, the risk of massive bleeding decreased by 7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88-0.98]. The risk of major bleeding was reduced by 44% in patients with a CL greater than 33 mm (95% CI, 0.33-0.97) compared with patients with a CL less than 33 mm. CL was negatively associated with massive intraoperative bleeding in patients with PAS combined with placenta previa. When the CL was greater than 33 mm, the risk of bleeding decreased by 44%. Thus, CL can be used as a standalone parameter to identify the risk of massive intraoperative bleeding in patients with suspected PAS."

The results showed the presence of large quantity of α-bisabolol (53.88%) followed by the related compound α-bisabolol-oxide (2.76%), and spathulenol (5.94%). Based on the composition of the essential oils of all the other <i>Achillea</i> taxa, several consideration have been carried out.

To study age at death (AD) and its determinants in cohorts of middle-aged men followed-up until extinction. A total of 9063 middle-aged men enrolled in 10 cohorts of 6 countries (USA, Finland, the Netherlands, Italy, Greece and Japan) within the Seven Countries Study were examined and then followed up for 60 years until extinction. AD was computed and a small number of risk factors were tested through multiple linear regression as possibly related to attained AD. AD ranged across cohorts from 71.8 years in East Finland and 80.5 years in Crete with levels roughly lower in the USA and Northern Europe and higher elsewhere. Across cohorts, the correlation coefficients of systolic blood pressure (R = -0.58) and of CVD prevalence (R = -0.65) versus average AD were the only significant ones. At the individual level in the pool of all cohorts, a multiple linear regression model showed that age, vigorous physical activity, never and ex-smokers were favorably related to AD, while the reverse was true for systolic blood pressure, heart rate, serum cholesterol, CVD prevalence and silent ECG abnormalities. BMI had a parabolic relationship with AD. The predicting power of single risk factors, expressed in years gained or lost, was relatively small, but arbitrary combinations of several of them produced large differences in AD. A small number of CVD risk factors were strongly associated with AD in a life-long follow-up.

The affected fish had been entrapped in a small pond at the side of the stream with practically zero water renewal as the event occurred in August which is a dry season for the island of Crete. The event was alarming for the local community since anthropogenic pollution was initially suspected which could pose a significant human health threat. Following examination of the fish, the mortality was attributed to heavy infection by the parasitic flagellate, Ichthyobodo sp., whilst no pollutants were detected. The parasite was studied through light and scanning electron microscopy and was identified molecularly.

"Bacterial antibiotic resistance (AMR) is a significant threat to public health, with the sentinel 'ESKAPEE' pathogens, being of particular concern. A cohort study spanning 5.5 years (2016-2021) was conducted at a provincial general hospital in Crete, Greece, to describe the epidemiology of ESKAPEE-associated bacteraemia regarding levels of AMR and their impact on patient outcomes. In total, 239 bloodstream isolates were examined from 226 patients (0.7% of 32 996 admissions) with a median age of 75 years, 28% of whom had severe comorbidity and 46% with prior stay in ICU. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was lowest for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (30%) and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (33%), and highest among <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (97%); the latter included 8 (22%) with extensive drug-resistance (XDR), half of which were resistant to all antibiotics tested. MDR bacteraemia was more likely to be healthcare-associated than community-onset (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04-2.65). Inpatient mortality was 22%, 35% and 63% for non-MDR, MDR and XDR episodes, respectively (<i>P</i> = 0.004). Competing risks survival analysis revealed increasing mortality linked to longer hospitalisation with increasing AMR levels, as well as differential pathogen-specific effects. <i>A. baumannii</i> bacteraemia was the most fatal (14-day death hazard ratio 3.39, 95% CI 1.74-6.63). Differences in microbiology, AMR profile and associated mortality compared to national and international data emphasise the importance of similar investigations of local epidemiology."

In the early 2000s, numerous cases of European amphibian population declines and mass die-offs started to emerge. Investigating those events led to the discovery that wild European amphibians were confronted with grave disease threats caused by introduced pathogens, namely the amphibian and the salamander chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal) and ranaviruses. In Greece, Bd was previously documented among wild amphibian populations in 2 different locations and 3 different species. However, no disease-related mass declines or mortality events have been reported. In this work, we build upon previous findings with new, subsequently obtained data, resulting in a 225-sample dataset of 14 species from 17 different locations throughout Greece, in order to examine the occurrence status of all 3 pathogens responsible for emerging infectious diseases in European amphibians. No positive samples for Bsal or ranavirus were recorded in any location. We confirmed the presence of Bd in 4 more localities and in 4 more species, including 1 urodelan (Macedonian crested newt Triturus macedonicus) and 1 introduced anuran (American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus). All insular localities were negative for Bd, except for Crete, where Bd was identified in 2 different locations. Again, no mass declines or die-offs were recorded in any Bd-positive area or elsewhere. However, given the persistence of Bd across Greece over the past ~20 yr, monitoring efforts should continue, and ideally be further expanded.

CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations increase by 2.4 ppm·y<sup>-1</sup> since 2002, in agreement with the general north hemisphere trend as derived by worldwide NOAA observations. CH<sub>4</sub> showed a mean increasing trend of 7.5 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup> since 2002, a rate that has accelerated since 2018 (12.4 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup>).

Both CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> present maxima during winter and minima during summer, in general agreement with the observations at the ICOS stations in Europe. CO also presents the highest values in winter and the lowest values in summer during June, while a secondary maximum is seen in August, which can be attributed to open fires that often occur in the area during this period. The mean summertime diurnal cycles of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO agree with a 24-h mean OH radical concentration of the order of 0.3-1 × 10<sup>7</sup> molecules·cm<sup>-3</sup> over the region, in general agreement with the only existing in-situ observations at Finokalia for 2001.

"Desert dust storms (DDS) are natural events that impact not only populations close to the emission sources but also populations many kilometers away. Countries located across the main dust sources, including countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, are highly affected by DDS. In addition, climate change is expanding arid areas exacerbating DDS events. Currently, there are no intervention measures with proven, quantified exposure reduction to desert dust particles. As part of the wider ""MEDEA"" project, co-funded by LIFE 2016 Programme, we examined the effectiveness of an indoor exposure-reduction intervention (i.e., decrease home ventilation during DDS events and continuous use of air purifier during DDS and non-DDS days) across homes and/or classrooms of schoolchildren with asthma and adults with atrial fibrillation in Cyprus and Crete-Greece. Participants were randomized to a control or intervention groups, including an indoor intervention group with exposure reduction measures and the use of air purifiers. Particle sampling, PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5,</sub> was conducted in participants' homes and/or classrooms, between 2019 and 2022, during DDS-free weeks and during DDS days for as long as the event lasted. In indoor and outdoor PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> samples, mass and content in main and trace elements was determined. Indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> mass concentrations, adjusting for premise type and dust conditions, were significantly lower in the indoor intervention group compared to the control group (PM<sub>2.5-intervention</sub>/PM<sub>2.5-control</sub> = 0.57, 95 % CI: 0.47, 0.70; PM<sub>10-intervention</sub>/PM<sub>10-control</sub> = 0.59, 95 % CI: 0.49, 0.71). In addition, the PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> particles of outdoor origin were significantly lower in the intervention vs. the control group (PM<sub>2.5</sub> infiltration intervention-to-control ratio: 0.49, 95 % CI: 0.42, 0.58; PM<sub>10</sub> infiltration intervention-to-control ratio: 0.68, 95 % CI: 0.52, 0.89). Our findings suggest that the use of air purifiers alongside decreased ventilation measures is an effective protective measure that reduces significantly indoor exposure to particles during DDS and non-DDS in high-risk population groups."

Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) requires lengthy diagnostic procedures, typically available at tertiary Health Care Centers (HCC). This prospective study evaluated a flexible Machine Learning (ML) framework toward identifying persons with MCI or dementia based on information that can be readily available in a primary HC setting. Demographic and clinical data, informant ratings of recent behavioral changes, self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms, subjective cognitive complaints, and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were pooled from two aging cohorts from the island of Crete, Greece (N = 763 aged 60-93 years) comprising persons diagnosed with MCI (n = 277) or dementia (n = 153), and cognitively non-impaired persons (CNI, n = 333). A Balanced Random Forest Classifier was used for classification and variable importance-based feature selection in nested cross-validation schemes (CNI vs MCI, CNI vs Dementia, MCI vs Dementia). Global-level model-agnostic analyses identified predictors displaying nonlinear behavior. Local level agnostic analyses pinpointed key predictor variables for a given classification result after statistically controlling for all other predictors in the model. Classification of MCI vs CNI was achieved with improved sensitivity (74 %) and comparable specificity (73 %) compared to MMSE alone (37.2 % and 94.3 %, respectively). Additional high-ranking features included age, education, behavioral changes, multicomorbidity and polypharmacy. Higher classification accuracy was achieved for MCI vs Dementia (sensitivity/specificity = 87 %) and CNI vs Dementia (sensitivity/specificity = 94 %) using the same set of variables. Model agnostic analyses revealed notable individual variability in the contribution of specific variables toward a given classification result. Improved capacity to identify elderly with MCI can be achieved by combining demographic and medical information readily available at the PHC setting with MMSE scores, and informant ratings of behavioral changes. Explainability at the patient level may help clinicians identify specific predictor variables and patient scores to a given prediction outcome toward personalized risk assessment.

Recent discovery of ectopic repeats (outside CRISPR arrays) provided unprecedented insights into the nondefense roles of CRISPR-Cas. A striking example is the addiction module CreTA (CRISPR-regulated toxin-antitoxins), where one or two (in most cases) ectopic repeats produce CRISPR-resembling antitoxic (CreA) RNAs that direct the CRISPR effector Cascade to transcriptionally repress a toxic RNA (CreT). Here, we demonstrated that CreTA repeats are extensively degenerated in sequence, with the first repeat (ψR1) being more diverged than the second one (ψR2). As a result, such addiction modules become highly specific to their physically-linked CRISPR-Cas loci, and in most cases, CreA could not harness a heterologous CRISPR-Cas to suppress its cognate toxin. We further disclosed that this specificity primarily derives from the degeneration of ψR1, and could generally be altered by modifying this repeat element. We also showed that the degenerated repeats of CreTA were insusceptible to recombination and thus more stable compared to a typical CRISPR array, which could be exploited to develop highly stable CRISPR-based tools. These data illustrated that repeat degeneration (a common feature of ectopic repeats) improves the stability and specificity of CreTA in protecting CRISPR-Cas, which could have contributed to the widespread occurrence and deep diversification of CRISPR systems.

"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer; the level of HPV-related knowledge among young students remains however questionable. The purpose of the present study was to investigate knowledge pertaining to HPV, cervical cancer screening, and vaccination among students in the Nursing Department and Department of Social Work of the Hellenic Mediterranean University of Crete, Greece. This was a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study involving 371 first-year and third-year students of the two Departments. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated with knowledge related to HPV, cervical cancer screening, and HPV vaccination. Only 22.1% of students knew all the ways of HPV transmission and only 5.9% knew the whole spectrum of cancers that HPV could cause. The vaccination rate for HPV was 33.7%. The majority of students used the Internet as the main source of information (62.3%). Students' sociodemographic characteristics, including age, marital status, and Department of studies were associated with knowledge about HPV. The present study highlights knowledge gaps and indicates the need for thorough health education strategies on HPV, targeting families and young people."

Honey's bacteriostatic or bactericidal capacity varies depending on its composition and the bacterial type of each infection. Nevertheless, not all honey samples possess anti-inflammatory or antibacterial properties and their mechanism of action has not been clearly elucidated. <b>Objectives:</b> We therefore investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of three different honey samples that derived from different geographical areas of Greece and different botanical origins, namely, arbutus, chestnut, and fir; they were compared to manuka honey, previously known for its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> To test the anti-inflammatory activity of the different samples, we utilized the in vivo model of LPS-driven inflammation, which induces septic shock without the presence of pathogens. To evaluate the antibacterial action of the same honey preparations, we utilized the cecal-slurry-induced peritonitis model in mice. Since acute inflammation and sepsis reduce the biotransformation capacity of the liver, the expression of key enzymes in the process was also measured. <b>Results:</b> The administration of all Greek honey samples to LPS-stimulated mice revealed a potent anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing the TNFα serum levels and the expression of TNFα and iNOS in the liver at levels comparable to those of the manuka honey, but they had no effect on IL-6 or IL-1β. It was shown that the LPS-induced suppression of CYP1A1 in the liver was reversed by Epirus and Crete fir honey, while, correspondingly, the suppression of CYP2B10 in the liver was reversed by Evros chestnut and Epirus fir honey. The effect of the same honey samples in polymicrobial peritonitis in mice was also evaluated. Even though no effect was observed on the disease severity or peritoneal bacterial load, the bacterial load in the liver was reduced in mice treated with Evros chestnut, Epiros fir, and Crete fir, while the bacterial load in the lungs was reduced in Epirus arbutus, Crete fir, and manuka honey-treated mice. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that these specific Greek honey samples possess distinct anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, as evidenced by the reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators and the impaired translocation of bacteria to tissues in septic mice.

Insecticide resistance has emerged in various western flower thrips (WFT) populations across the world, threatening the efficiency of chemical control applications. Elucidation of insecticide resistance mechanisms at the molecular level provides markers for the development of diagnostics, to monitor the trait and support evidence-based resistance management. TaqMan and Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) diagnostics were developed and validated, against Sanger sequencing, in individual and pooled WFT samples, respectively, for the: G275E mutation (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α6 gene- nAChR α6) associated with resistance to nAChR allosteric modulators - site I (spinosyns), L1014F, T929I, T929C and T292V mutations (voltage-gated sodium channel gene- vgsc) linked with pyrethroid resistance and I1017M (chitin synthase 1 gene- chs1) conferring resistance to growth inhibitors affecting CHS1 (benzoylureas). The detection limits of ddPCR assays for mutant allelic frequencies (MAFs) were in the range of 0.1%-0.2%. The assays were applied in nine WFT field populations from Crete, Greece. The G275E (MAF = 29.66%-100.0%), T929I and T929V (combined MAFs = 100%), L1014F (MAF = 11.01%-37.29%) and I1017M (MAF = 17.74%-51.07%) mutations, were present in all populations. The molecular diagnostics panel that was developed in this study can facilitate the quick and sensitive pesticide resistance monitoring of WFT populations at the molecular level, to support evidence-based IRM strategies.

"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer; the level of HPV-related knowledge among young students remains however questionable. The purpose of the present study was to investigate knowledge pertaining to HPV, cervical cancer screening, and vaccination among students in the Nursing Department and Department of Social Work of the Hellenic Mediterranean University of Crete, Greece. This was a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study involving 371 first-year and third-year students of the two Departments. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated with knowledge related to HPV, cervical cancer screening, and HPV vaccination. Only 22.1% of students knew all the ways of HPV transmission and only 5.9% knew the whole spectrum of cancers that HPV could cause. The vaccination rate for HPV was 33.7%. The majority of students used the Internet as the main source of information (62.3%). Students' sociodemographic characteristics, including age, marital status, and Department of studies were associated with knowledge about HPV. The present study highlights knowledge gaps and indicates the need for thorough health education strategies on HPV, targeting families and young people."

The first investigation of dietary intake in the Mediterranean region was undertaken at the initiative of the government of Greece in 1948. Plant foods (cereals, pulses, nuts, potatoes, vegetables and fruits) accounted for 61 % of total energy intake (TEI), animal foods (meat, eggs, fish and dairy products) for 7 % of TEI and olive oil was the main oil used. In 1950s, Ancel Keys undertook studies in USA, Italy, Spain, England, Japan, Australia and Canada leading him to hypothesise that a link could exist between diet, plasma cholesterol and CHD. Between 1958 and 1964, Keys and co-workers carried out the Seven Countries Study, which enrolled men aged 40-59 years in one of sixteen cohorts from seven countries (Finland, Greece, Italy, Yugoslavia, Japan, USA and Italy). After 15-, 25- and 50-year follow-up, a strong positive relation was observed between saturated fat intake and CHD mortality, and a negative one with Mediterranean Dietary Index. In 1975, Keys and his wife published a book entitled: 'How to eat well and stay well. The Mediterranean way', which popularised Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet). After 45-year follow-up, longevity without CHD death was 12·9 years higher in Crete than in Finland. Protecting effect of MedDiet towards CHD incidence and risk is now confirmed by Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea study and by cohorts' studies gathered in several recent meta-analyses. MedDiet is sustainable and recognised by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage, which is the most beautiful homage that can be paid to Ancel Keys and all his co-workers.

"Current public health recommendations for desert dust storms (DDS) events focus on vulnerable population groups, such as children with asthma, and include advice to stay indoors and limit outdoor physical activity. To date, no scientific evidence exists on the efficacy of these recommendations in reducing DDS exposure. We aimed to objectively assess the behavioral responses of children with asthma to recommendations for reduction of DDS exposure. In two heavily affected by DDS Mediterranean regions (Cyprus &amp; Crete, Greece), schoolchildren with asthma (6-11 years) were recruited from primary schools and were randomized to control (business as usual scenario) and intervention groups. All children were equipped with pedometer and GPS sensors embedded in smartwatches for objective real-time data collection from inside and outside their classroom and household settings. Interventions included the timely communication of personal DDS alerts accompanied by exposure reduction recommendations to both the parents and school-teachers of children in the intervention group. A mixed effect model was used to assess changes in daily levels of time spent, and steps performed outside classrooms and households, between non-DDS and DDS days across the study groups. The change in the time spent outside classrooms and homes, between non-DDS and DDS days, was 37.2 min (p<sub>value</sub> = 0.098) in the control group and -62.4 min (p<sub>value</sub> &lt; 0.001) in the intervention group. The difference in the effects between the two groups was statistically significant (interaction p<sub>value</sub> &lt; 0.001). The change in daily steps performed outside classrooms and homes, was -495.1 steps (p<sub>value</sub> = 0.350) in the control group and -1039.5 (p<sub>value</sub> = 0.003) in the intervention group (interaction p<sub>value</sub> = 0.575). The effects on both the time and steps performed outside were more profound during after-school hours. To summarize, among children with asthma, we demonstrated that timely personal DDS alerts and detailed recommendations lead to significant behavioral changes in contrast to the usual public health recommendations."

In our new interpretation, the Trachilos succession is Late Pliocene and part of a shallowing marine series that became subaerially exposed some 3 millions of years ago. Placed in a larger geological context, Crete was an island during the Late Pliocene and separated by ~ 100 km of open sea from the nearest European mainland, and therefore out of reach of Late Pliocene hominins.

To study age at death (AD) and its determinants in cohorts of middle-aged men followed-up until extinction. A total of 9063 middle-aged men enrolled in 10 cohorts of 6 countries (USA, Finland, the Netherlands, Italy, Greece and Japan) within the Seven Countries Study were examined and then followed up for 60 years until extinction. AD was computed and a small number of risk factors were tested through multiple linear regression as possibly related to attained AD. AD ranged across cohorts from 71.8 years in East Finland and 80.5 years in Crete with levels roughly lower in the USA and Northern Europe and higher elsewhere. Across cohorts, the correlation coefficients of systolic blood pressure (R = -0.58) and of CVD prevalence (R = -0.65) versus average AD were the only significant ones. At the individual level in the pool of all cohorts, a multiple linear regression model showed that age, vigorous physical activity, never and ex-smokers were favorably related to AD, while the reverse was true for systolic blood pressure, heart rate, serum cholesterol, CVD prevalence and silent ECG abnormalities. BMI had a parabolic relationship with AD. The predicting power of single risk factors, expressed in years gained or lost, was relatively small, but arbitrary combinations of several of them produced large differences in AD. A small number of CVD risk factors were strongly associated with AD in a life-long follow-up.

Trust and empathy constitute basic elements of healthcare delivery. In recent years, the quest for greater efficiency in healthcare has also indicated the necessity of these values. The study aims to develop and assess a 10-item tool, namely, the Personal Trust and Connections (PerTC) scale. The study was conducted at a general hospital in eastern Crete, Greece. A total of 218 healthcare professionals participated over a six-week period in 2021. The 10-item PerTC scale encompasses emotional, social, and cognitive reliance variables. The scale was tested for reliability, and scale scores were assessed for convergent validity. PerTC scale was found with high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.863). At a multivariate level, younger age (<i>p</i> = 0.016), more work experience years (<i>p</i> = 0.001), the experience of a recent family crisis event (<i>p</i> = 0.028), and use of the internet in free time (<i>p</i> = 0.028) were significantly related to increased total scores of the PerTC scale. The new scale is an easy-to-use metric tool with good overall reliability. PerTC may be a suitable instrument to indirectly identify determinants and drivers in order to explore pathways to collectively build on trustful interaction and altruistic connection within a healthcare environment.

CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations increase by 2.4 ppm·y<sup>-1</sup> since 2002, in agreement with the general north hemisphere trend as derived by worldwide NOAA observations. CH<sub>4</sub> showed a mean increasing trend of 7.5 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup> since 2002, a rate that has accelerated since 2018 (12.4 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup>). In contrast, CO has decreased by 1.6 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup> since 2002, which resulted from a strong decrease until 2017 (2.5 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup>), followed by a small increase in the last 3 years (0.2 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup>). Both CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> present maxima during winter and minima during summer, in general agreement with the observations at the ICOS stations in Europe. CO also presents the highest values in winter and the lowest values in summer during June, while a secondary maximum is seen in August, which can be attributed to open fires that often occur in the area during this period. The mean summertime diurnal cycles of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO agree with a 24-h mean OH radical concentration of the order of 0.3-1 × 10<sup>7</sup> molecules·cm<sup>-3</sup> over the region, in general agreement with the only existing in-situ observations at Finokalia for 2001.

Elucidation of insecticide resistance mechanisms at the molecular level provides markers for the development of diagnostics to monitor the trait and support evidence-based resistance management. TaqMan and Droplet Digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) diagnostics were developed and validated, against Sanger sequencing, in individual and pooled WFT samples respectively, for the G275E mutation (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α6 gene, nAChR α6) associated with resistance to nAChR allosteric modulators, site I (spinosyns); L1014F, T929I, T929C and T292V mutations (voltage-gated sodium channel gene, vgsc) linked with pyrethroid resistance; and I1017M (chitin synthase 1 gene, chs1) conferring resistance to growth inhibitors affecting CHS1 (benzoylureas).

"Current public health recommendations for desert dust storms (DDS) events focus on vulnerable population groups, such as children with asthma, and include advice to stay indoors and limit outdoor physical activity. To date, no scientific evidence exists on the efficacy of these recommendations in reducing DDS exposure. We aimed to objectively assess the behavioral responses of children with asthma to recommendations for reduction of DDS exposure. In two heavily affected by DDS Mediterranean regions (Cyprus &amp; Crete, Greece), schoolchildren with asthma (6-11 years) were recruited from primary schools and were randomized to control (business as usual scenario) and intervention groups. All children were equipped with pedometer and GPS sensors embedded in smartwatches for objective real-time data collection from inside and outside their classroom and household settings. Interventions included the timely communication of personal DDS alerts accompanied by exposure reduction recommendations to both the parents and school-teachers of children in the intervention group. A mixed effect model was used to assess changes in daily levels of time spent, and steps performed outside classrooms and households, between non-DDS and DDS days across the study groups. The change in the time spent outside classrooms and homes, between non-DDS and DDS days, was 37.2 min (p<sub>value</sub> = 0.098) in the control group and -62.4 min (p<sub>value</sub> &lt; 0.001) in the intervention group. The difference in the effects between the two groups was statistically significant (interaction p<sub>value</sub> &lt; 0.001). The change in daily steps performed outside classrooms and homes, was -495.1 steps (p<sub>value</sub> = 0.350) in the control group and -1039.5 (p<sub>value</sub> = 0.003) in the intervention group (interaction p<sub>value</sub> = 0.575). The effects on both the time and steps performed outside were more profound during after-school hours. To summarize, among children with asthma, we demonstrated that timely personal DDS alerts and detailed recommendations lead to significant behavioral changes in contrast to the usual public health recommendations."

"(1) Background: Although spatial statistics are often used by cancer epidemiologists, there is not yet an established collection of methods to serve their needs. We aimed to develop an evidence-based cancer-oriented conceptual collection of methods for spatial analysis; (2) Methods: A triangulation of approaches was used; literature review, consensus meetings (expert panel), and testing the selected methods on ""training"" databases. The literature review was conducted in three databases. This approach guided the development of a collection of methods that was subsequently commented on by the expert panel and tested on ""training data"" of cancer cases obtained from the Cancer Registry of Crete based on three epidemiological scenarios: (a) low prevalence cancers, (b) high prevalence cancers, (c) cancer and risk factors; (3) Results: The final spatial epidemiology conceptual collection of methods covered: data preparation/testing randomness, data protection, mapping/visualizing, geographic correlation studies, clustering/surveillance, integration of cancer data with socio-economic, clinical and environmental factors. Some of the tests/techniques included in the conceptual collection of methods were: buffer and proximity analysis, exploratory spatial analysis and others. All suggested that statistical models were found to fit well (R2 = 0.72-0.96) in ""training data""; Conclusions: The proposed conceptual collection of methods provides public health professionals with a useful methodological framework along with recommendations for assessing diverse research questions of global health."

Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) requires lengthy diagnostic procedures, typically available at tertiary Health Care Centers (HCC). This prospective study evaluated a flexible Machine Learning (ML) framework toward identifying persons with MCI or dementia based on information that can be readily available in a primary HC setting. Demographic and clinical data, informant ratings of recent behavioral changes, self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms, subjective cognitive complaints, and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were pooled from two aging cohorts from the island of Crete, Greece (N = 763 aged 60-93 years) comprising persons diagnosed with MCI (n = 277) or dementia (n = 153), and cognitively non-impaired persons (CNI, n = 333). A Balanced Random Forest Classifier was used for classification and variable importance-based feature selection in nested cross-validation schemes (CNI vs MCI, CNI vs Dementia, MCI vs Dementia). Global-level model-agnostic analyses identified predictors displaying nonlinear behavior. Local level agnostic analyses pinpointed key predictor variables for a given classification result after statistically controlling for all other predictors in the model. Classification of MCI vs CNI was achieved with improved sensitivity (74 %) and comparable specificity (73 %) compared to MMSE alone (37.2 % and 94.3 %, respectively). Additional high-ranking features included age, education, behavioral changes, multicomorbidity and polypharmacy. Higher classification accuracy was achieved for MCI vs Dementia (sensitivity/specificity = 87 %) and CNI vs Dementia (sensitivity/specificity = 94 %) using the same set of variables. Model agnostic analyses revealed notable individual variability in the contribution of specific variables toward a given classification result. Improved capacity to identify elderly with MCI can be achieved by combining demographic and medical information readily available at the PHC setting with MMSE scores, and informant ratings of behavioral changes. Explainability at the patient level may help clinicians identify specific predictor variables and patient scores to a given prediction outcome toward personalized risk assessment.

We aimed to objectively assess the behavioral responses of children with asthma to recommendations for reduction of DDS exposure. In two heavily affected by DDS Mediterranean regions (Cyprus &amp; Crete, Greece), schoolchildren with asthma (6-11 years) were recruited from primary schools and were randomized to control (business as usual scenario) and intervention groups. All children were equipped with pedometer and GPS sensors embedded in smartwatches for objective real-time data collection from inside and outside their classroom and household settings. Interventions included the timely communication of personal DDS alerts accompanied by exposure reduction recommendations to both the parents and school-teachers of children in the intervention group. A mixed effect model was used to assess changes in daily levels of time spent, and steps performed outside classrooms and households, between non-DDS and DDS days across the study groups. The change in the time spent outside classrooms and homes, between non-DDS and DDS days, was 37.2 min (p<sub>value</sub> = 0.098) in the control group and -62.4 min (p<sub>value</sub> &lt; 0.001) in the intervention group. The difference in the effects between the two groups was statistically significant (interaction p<sub>value</sub> &lt; 0.001). The change in daily steps performed outside classrooms and homes, was -495.1 steps (p<sub>value</sub> = 0.350) in the control group and -1039.5 (p<sub>value</sub> = 0.003) in the intervention group (interaction p<sub>value</sub> = 0.575). The effects on both the time and steps performed outside were more profound during after-school hours. To summarize, among children with asthma, we demonstrated that timely personal DDS alerts and detailed recommendations lead to significant behavioral changes in contrast to the usual public health recommendations."

Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) requires lengthy diagnostic procedures, typically available at tertiary Health Care Centers (HCC). This prospective study evaluated a flexible Machine Learning (ML) framework toward identifying persons with MCI or dementia based on information that can be readily available in a primary HC setting. Demographic and clinical data, informant ratings of recent behavioral changes, self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms, subjective cognitive complaints, and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were pooled from two aging cohorts from the island of Crete, Greece (N = 763 aged 60-93 years) comprising persons diagnosed with MCI (n = 277) or dementia (n = 153), and cognitively non-impaired persons (CNI, n = 333). A Balanced Random Forest Classifier was used for classification and variable importance-based feature selection in nested cross-validation schemes (CNI vs MCI, CNI vs Dementia, MCI vs Dementia). Global-level model-agnostic analyses identified predictors displaying nonlinear behavior. Local level agnostic analyses pinpointed key predictor variables for a given classification result after statistically controlling for all other predictors in the model. Classification of MCI vs CNI was achieved with improved sensitivity (74 %) and comparable specificity (73 %) compared to MMSE alone (37.2 % and 94.3 %, respectively). Additional high-ranking features included age, education, behavioral changes, multicomorbidity and polypharmacy. Higher classification accuracy was achieved for MCI vs Dementia (sensitivity/specificity = 87 %) and CNI vs Dementia (sensitivity/specificity = 94 %) using the same set of variables. Model agnostic analyses revealed notable individual variability in the contribution of specific variables toward a given classification result. Improved capacity to identify elderly with MCI can be achieved by combining demographic and medical information readily available at the PHC setting with MMSE scores, and informant ratings of behavioral changes. Explainability at the patient level may help clinicians identify specific predictor variables and patient scores to a given prediction outcome toward personalized risk assessment.

The Neolithic and Bronze Ages were highly transformative periods for the genetic history of Europe but for the Aegean-a region fundamental to Europe's prehistory-the biological dimensions of cultural transitions have been elucidated only to a limited extent so far. We have analysed newly generated genome-wide data from 102 ancient individuals from Crete, the Greek mainland and the Aegean Islands, spanning from the Neolithic to the Iron Age. We found that the early farmers from Crete shared the same ancestry as other contemporaneous Neolithic Aegeans. In contrast, the end of the Neolithic period and the following Early Bronze Age were marked by 'eastern' gene flow, which was predominantly of Anatolian origin in Crete. Confirming previous findings for additional Central/Eastern European ancestry in the Greek mainland by the Middle Bronze Age, we additionally show that such genetic signatures appeared in Crete gradually from the seventeenth to twelfth centuries BC, a period when the influence of the mainland over the island intensified. Biological and cultural connectedness within the Aegean is also supported by the finding of consanguineous endogamy practiced at high frequencies, unprecedented in the global ancient DNA record. Our results highlight the potential of archaeogenomic approaches in the Aegean for unravelling the interplay of genetic admixture, marital and other cultural practices.
PMID:29402118	Kotsiou A, Michalaki V, Anagnostopoulou HN	Acta Med Hist Adriat. 15(2):283-290	2017	Devastating epidemics in recent ages Greek populations 	In the recent Greek ages the most devastating epidemics were plague, smallpox, leprosy and cholera. In 1816 plague struck the Ionian and Aegean Islands, mainland Greece, Constantinople and Smyrna. The Venetians ruling the Ionian Islands effectively combated plague in contrast to the Ottomans ruling all other regions. In 1922, plague appeared in Patras refugees who were expelled by the Turks from Smyrna and Asia Minor. Inoculation against smallpox was first performed in Thessaly by the Greek women, and the Greek doctors Emmanouel Timonis (1713, Oxford) and Jakovos Pylarinos (1715, Venice) made relevant scientific publications. The first leper colony opened in Chios Island. In Crete, Spinalonga was transformed into a leper island, which following the Independence War against Turkish occupation and the unification of Crete with Greece in 1913, was classified as an International Leper Hospital. Cholera struck Greece in 1853-1854 brought by the French troops during the Crimean War, and again during the Balkan Wars (1912-13) when the Bulgarian troops brought cholera to northern Greece. Due to successive wars, medical assistance was not always available, so desperate people turned many times to religion through processions in honor of local saints, for their salvation in epidemics.

Economic or Health Crisis?	"(1) Background: This is the first population-based study in Greece, with the aim to measure the changing trends of lung cancer (LC) and the associated risk factors before and after the economic crisis. Among the main objectives were the identification of LC hot spots and high-risk areas; (2) Methods: The study was conducted in Crete, the biggest island in Greece. Data (5057 LC cases) were collected from the Cancer Registry of Crete (CRC). The age-standardized incidence and mortality rates (ASIR, ASMR/100,000/year) were estimated, while additional indexes were used, including the adjusted Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI%), the deprivation index (HPI-2), and the exposure to outdoor air pollution (OAP). The analysis was performed for two time periods (Period A: 1992-2008; Period B: 2009-2013); (3) Results: ASIR presented a significant increase during the economic crisis, while an even higher increase was observed in ASMR (Period A: ASMR = 30.5/100,000/year; Period B: ASMR = 43.8/100,000/year; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). After 2009, a significant increase in the observed LC hot spots was identified in several sub-regions in Crete (<i>p</i> = 0.04). The risk of LC mortality increased even more for smokers (RR = 5.7; 95%CI = 5.2-6.3) and those living in highly deprived geographical regions (RR = 5.4; 95%CI = 5.1-5.8) during the austerity period. The multiple effect of LC predictors resulted in adjusted RRs ranging from 0.7 to 5.7 within the island (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05); (4) Conclusions: The increased LC burden after the onset of the economic crisis, along with a changing pattern of LC predictors stressed the urgent need of geographically oriented interventions and cancer control programs focusing on the most deprived or vulnerable population groups."

"Desert dust storms (DDS) are natural events that impact not only populations close to the emission sources but also populations many kilometers away. Countries located across the main dust sources, including countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, are highly affected by DDS. In addition, climate change is expanding arid areas exacerbating DDS events. Currently, there are no intervention measures with proven, quantified exposure reduction to desert dust particles. As part of the wider ""MEDEA"" project, co-funded by LIFE 2016 Programme, we examined the effectiveness of an indoor exposure-reduction intervention (i.e., decrease home ventilation during DDS events and continuous use of air purifier during DDS and non-DDS days) across homes and/or classrooms of schoolchildren with asthma and adults with atrial fibrillation in Cyprus and Crete-Greece. Participants were randomized to a control or intervention groups, including an indoor intervention group with exposure reduction measures and the use of air purifiers. Particle sampling, PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5,</sub> was conducted in participants' homes and/or classrooms, between 2019 and 2022, during DDS-free weeks and during DDS days for as long as the event lasted. In indoor and outdoor PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> samples, mass and content in main and trace elements was determined. Indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> mass concentrations, adjusting for premise type and dust conditions, were significantly lower in the indoor intervention group compared to the control group (PM<sub>2.5-intervention</sub>/PM<sub>2.5-control</sub> = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.70; PM<sub>10-intervention</sub>/PM<sub>10-control</sub> = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.71). In addition, the PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> particles of outdoor origin were significantly lower in the intervention vs. the control group (PM<sub>2.5</sub> infiltration intervention-to-control ratio: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.58; PM<sub>10</sub> infiltration intervention-to-control ratio: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.89). Our findings suggest that the use of air purifiers alongside decreased ventilation measures is an effective protective measure that reduces significantly indoor exposure to particles during DDS and non-DDS in high-risk population groups."

Evidence showed that Crete grapevine cultivars and winemaking date back to 2300 BC. In this study, fifty-one genotypes belonging to seven different traditional <i>Vitis vinifera</i> cultivars, presumed autochthonous to the island of Crete, were selected for their wine-producing potential and classified by 51 ampelographic descriptors. In addition, five genotypes belonging to two non-autochthonous cultivars were included as out-group controls. Subsequently, in order to characterize genetic diversity, establish genetic relationships within and between cultivars and solve accession-labeling problems, genotypes were fingerprinted employing Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR or microsatellite) markers. Four of the autochthonous cultivars namely 'Vidiano', 'Vilana', 'Plyto', and 'Moschato Spinas' are used in the local economy for blanc (white) wine production while the rest, namely 'Kotsifali', 'Liatiko' and 'Mantilari' for Noir (red) wines. The two cultivars employed as out-group were 'Moschato Samou' and 'Moschato Alexandrias': both white wine producers. Ampelography-based clustering grouped the majority of genotypes along cultivar-specific clusters. All three Moschato cultivars formed a distinct clade pointing to the non-autochthonous origin of 'Moschato Spinas'. A total of one hundred and thirteen (113) SSR alleles were amplified from thirteen (13) SSR loci, with an average number of alleles per locus equal to 10.23 revealing ample genetic polymorphism. The cumulative probability of identity was also quite high (3.389 × 10<sup>-16</sup>). The overall observed heterozygosity was 0.837 while for twenty-nine of the examined genotypes, at least one private SSR allele was detected. The majority of genotypes were grouped in cultivar-specific clusters. The results of this paper pave the way for the certification and registration of clones of some of the most important wine-producing cultivars in Crete.

The aim of this work was to introduce the species to the green roof sector while serving urban agriculture. Thus, its growth potential was investigated, along with the content of nutrients (N, P, K, Na) and the accumulation of heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Ni, Mn, Zn, Fe) in its tissues, in two cultivation sites in Athens, Greece, i.e., an extensive green roof and at ground level next to a moderate traffic road. Cultivation took place in plastic containers with a green roof infrastructure fitted, in two substrate types (grape marc compost, perlite, and pumice 3:3:4 <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>, and grape marc compost, perlite, pumice, and soil 3:3:2:2 <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>), with 10 cm depth. Plant growth was favored by the soil substrate, but it was also satisfactory in the soilless one. Cultivation site affected heavy metal accumulation, resulting in higher concentrations both in leaves and in flowers at street level, while no differences were observed in roots. Washing the tissues reduced heavy metal concentrations only in leaves produced at the street level. Substrate type significantly affected Mn concentration in all plant tissues and Fe in roots, with the highest values measured in the soil substrate. Thus, <i>O. dictamnus</i> could be effectively cultivated in sustainable green roofs, better on a soilless substrate to lower construction weight. Careful selection of the cultivation site could minimize contamination with environmental pollutants if human consumption is also desired.

Subsequently, in order to characterize genetic diversity, establish genetic relationships within and between cultivars and solve accession-labeling problems, genotypes were fingerprinted employing Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR or microsatellite) markers. Four of the autochthonous cultivars namely 'Vidiano', 'Vilana', 'Plyto', and 'Moschato Spinas' are used in the local economy for blanc (white) wine production while the rest, namely 'Kotsifali', 'Liatiko' and 'Mantilari' for Noir (red) wines. The two cultivars employed as out-group were 'Moschato Samou' and 'Moschato Alexandrias': both white wine producers. Ampelography-based clustering grouped the majority of genotypes along cultivar-specific clusters. All three Moschato cultivars formed a distinct clade pointing to the non-autochthonous origin of 'Moschato Spinas'. A total of one hundred and thirteen (113) SSR alleles were amplified from thirteen (13) SSR loci, with an average number of alleles per locus equal to 10.23 revealing ample genetic polymorphism. The cumulative probability of identity was also quite high (3.389 × 10<sup>-16</sup>). The overall observed heterozygosity was 0.837 while for twenty-nine of the examined genotypes, at least one private SSR allele was detected. The majority of genotypes were grouped in cultivar-specific clusters. The results of this paper pave the way for the certification and registration of clones of some of the most important wine-producing cultivars in Crete.

The objective of this article is to assess the adherence of pregnant women to the national recommendations for influenza and pertussis vaccination and the reasons behind their non-adherence. This was a retrospective observational study conducted in a well-defined puerperant population of adequate healthcare standards from December 2018 to December 2019. The study was carried out with 1006 puerperants and 66 health care practitioners. Data were collected, including demographic-obstetric features of pregnant women, whether they received antenatal vaccination, the reasons for having been vaccinated or not as well as health professional's opinion regarding antenatal immunization. The uptake of influenza and pertussis vaccine during pregnancy was suboptimal with lack of recommendation of the vaccine by the healthcare providers being the main barrier. Factors positively associated with antenatal vaccination against influenza were higher level of maternal education and advanced maternal age while antenatal vaccination against pertussis was positively associated with higher level of maternal education. This large-scale retrospective study reveals the inadequacy of antenatal vaccination rates against pertussis and influenza in Crete, Greece. Results suggest that obstetricians' confidence in vaccination is of outmost importance for implementing immunization in pregnancy and any doubts on vaccine effectiveness and safety should be resolved. Routine antenatal vaccination counseling and pregnancy immunization campaigns are essential to improve vaccine uptake during pregnancy.

Twenty years of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO greenhouse gas atmospheric concentration measurements at Finokalia station on Crete in the Eastern Mediterranean region are presented. This dataset is the longest in the Eastern Mediterranean, based on bi-weekly grab sampling since 2002 and continuous observations since June 2014. CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations increase by 2.4 ppm·y<sup>-1</sup> since 2002, in agreement with the general north hemisphere trend as derived by worldwide NOAA observations. CH<sub>4</sub> showed a mean increasing trend of 7.5 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup> since 2002, a rate that has accelerated since 2018 (12.4 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup>). In contrast, CO has decreased by 1.6 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup> since 2002, which resulted from a strong decrease until 2017 (2.5 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup>), followed by a small increase in the last 3 years (0.2 ppb·y<sup>-1</sup>). Both CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> present maxima during winter and minima during summer, in general agreement with the observations at the ICOS stations in Europe. CO also presents the highest values in winter and the lowest values in summer during June, while a secondary maximum is seen in August, which can be attributed to open fires that often occur in the area during this period. The mean summertime diurnal cycles of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO agree with a 24-h mean OH radical concentration of the order of 0.3-1 × 10<sup>7</sup> molecules·cm<sup>-3</sup> over the region, in general agreement with the only existing in-situ observations at Finokalia for 2001.

Chohan Continuous Squeezing Suture (ACCSS) for controlling haemorrhage from the lower uterine segment at caesarean section for placenta praevia and accreta spectrum disorders. This prospective study was conducted on 47 patients with placenta praevia and accreta spectrum disorders from February 2019 to May 2022 in two teaching hospitals of Lahore and ACCSS was applied. The outcome measures were peripartum hysterectomy procedure time, estimated blood loss, number of blood transfusions, duration of stay in the hospital, bladder trauma, uterine necrosis, pelvic abscess formation, secondary postpartum haemorrhage and maternal mortality. Descriptive statistics were calculated by using SPSS version 21. Out of 47 patients, 7 (15%) had placenta creta, 29 (61.7%) increta, 11 (23.3%) percreta (grade 3a), and 36 (76.6%) central anterior dominant placenta. Peripartum hysterectomy was prevented in 97.8% of patients. ACCSS procedure time was 5-10 minutes (87.2%), with mean blood loss 2500±485 ml, mean blood transfusion 1.85±1.02 units and mean hospital stay of 3.3±0.84 days. One patient had bladder trauma. There was no case of uterine necrosis, pelvic abscess formation, secondary postpartum haemorrhage or maternal mortality. ACCSS appears to be a simple, effective and safe treatment option for placenta praevia and accreta spectrum disorders, as an alternative to hysterectomy.

"In Greece, the implementation of the Water Framework Directive for rivers is based mainly on benthic macroinvertebrates and uses a semi-quantitative method with a D-frame net, which is certified by the International Organization for Standardization. Before the official adoption of this method, a quantitative shovel sampler (""Cretan shovel"") was used in southern Greece (Crete), which has been implemented for almost three decades due to the specific river habitats found in Crete (e.g., seasonal flow, narrow riverbeds, and coarse substrates). In this study, we compared community metrics, diversity indices, feeding groups, locomotion types, and ecological quality derived from data collected using timed semi-quantitative kick samples and quantitative shovel samples collected from the same sites simultaneously. In total, 20 samples from the north and south of Greece were collected. The majority of community metrics, diversity indices, and traits were comparable between samplers. However, there were statistically significant differences in the relative abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, passive filterers' and the (semi) sessil groups, and Pielou's index. Most differences in the ecological quality between the kick and shovel samples were observed in 50% of the sites in northern Greece because the shovel is less effective at capturing motile zoobenthos. The ecological quality assessment in Crete by the Cretan shovel is comparable with the D-frame net in 75% of the samples. Thus, the Cretan shovel could efficiently sample the Cretan streams, which are characterized by coarse, narrow, turbulent, and hydrologically fluctuating river habitats. Such comparisons could improve sampling effectiveness and make additional data available to assess ecological quality."

"Overwintering capacity is a major step towards establishment of invasive mosquitoes from the tropics in temperate zone areas and one of the main elements determining next seasons' population size that regulates disease transmission of competent invasive vector species. The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culiciidae) is an aggressive invasive species that has greatly expanded its geographical boundaries over the last few decades. The species' ability to induce photoperiodic-based egg diapause allows its overwintering in temperate regions, which favors its establishment in higher latitudes. In warmer temperate areas winter survival can be accomplished in the adult stage as well especially in human-made shelters. Aedes albopictus is already showing signs of adaptation to colder climates which may result in disease transmission in new areas. Although the Asian tiger mosquito has invaded Greece since 2003-4, little is known regarding its overwintering capacity in the country, especially as far as adults are regarded. We studied the survival of Ae. albopictus adults during winter in a protected shelter in Athens, the capital city of Greece. The study involved two geographically isolated populations originating from Chania (Crete, most southern part of Greece), and Palaio Faliro (Athens, Central Greece). We exposed different cohorts of F3 adults of the above two populations that emerged from field collected eggs to ""winter condition"" from November 2018 to beginning of January 2019. in a protected microclimatic environment. Adult mortality was recorded systematically until the death of the last individual in the cohort. Results demonstrated evidence of winter survival of adults for both populations. Longevity of both females and males of the Palaio Faliro population was longer than that of the Chania population for almost all installation dates. Survival curves, regardless of the date of installation, were steeper for females of the Chania population compared to those from Palaio Faliro. In conclusion, overwinter survival of both populations in the adult stage highlights the need for future studies, considering local and microclimatic condition that vary significantly between regions. Winter climatic conditions play vital role in adult survival of this highly important public health species concerning distribution limits and knowledge on winter survival of Ae. albopictus transmitted viruses."

The gestational age of the 39 pregnant women delivered by cesarean section was 35<sup>+6</sup> weeks (range: 28<sup>+5</sup>-39<sup>+2</sup> weeks), of whom 7 cases at 28<sup>+5</sup>-33<sup>+6</sup> weeks, 20 cases at 34-36<sup>+6</sup> weeks, and 12 cases at 37-39<sup>+2</sup> weeks. The results of pathological examination were normal placenta in 3 cases (8%, 3/39), placenta creta in 4 cases (10%, 4/39), placenta increta in 9 cases (23%, 9/39) and placenta percreta in 23 cases (59%, 23/39). Among the 36 pregnant women who were pathologically confirmed as placenta accreta spectrum disorders (PAS) after surgery, the last prenatal ultrasonography showed placenta previa in 27 cases (75%, 27/36) and not observed placenta previa in 9 cases. The median intraoperative blood loss, autologous blood transfusion, and allogeneic suspended red blood cell infusion of 39 pregnant women during cesarean section were 1 000 ml (300-3 500 ml), 300 ml (0-2 000 ml) and 400 ml (0-2 400 ml), respectively. The uterine preservation rate was 100% (39/39), and only 1 case received cystostomy due to intracystic hemorrhage. The birth weight of the newborn was 2 580 g (1 350-3 800 g), and 1 case of mild asphyxia. <b>Conclusions:</b> Pregnant women with CSP who continue pregnancy under close monitoring after adequate ultrasound evaluation and doctor-patient communication could achieve better maternal and infant outcomes, but pregnant women with CSP are highly likely to continue pregnancy and develop into PAS.

We exposed different cohorts of F3 adults of the above two populations that emerged from field collected eggs to ""winter condition"" from November 2018 to beginning of January 2019. in a protected microclimatic environment. Adult mortality was recorded systematically until the death of the last individual in the cohort. Results demonstrated evidence of winter survival of adults for both populations. Longevity of both females and males of the Palaio Faliro population was longer than that of the Chania population for almost all installation dates. Survival curves, regardless of the date of installation, were steeper for females of the Chania population compared to those from Palaio Faliro. In conclusion, overwinter survival of both populations in the adult stage highlights the need for future studies, considering local and microclimatic condition that vary significantly between regions. Winter climatic conditions play vital role in adult survival of this highly important public health species concerning distribution limits and knowledge on winter survival of Ae. albopictus transmitted viruses."

"The aim of this study was to present the 3-year outcomes after simultaneous transepithelial phototherapeutic keratectomy (t-PTK) and conventional photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) followed by corneal crosslinking (CXL) for keratoconus. In this prospective, interventional case series, patients with progressive keratoconus underwent simultaneous t-PTK and conventional PRK followed by CXL (Cretan protocol plus). Visual, refractive, and topographic outcomes were evaluated along with endothelial cell density (ECD) preoperatively and at 1, 2, and 3 years postoperatively. Twenty-two patients (31 eyes) were enrolled. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed in any of the patients. Logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) mean uncorrected and mean corrected distance visual acuity improved from 0.81 ± 0.40 and 0.18 ± 0.21 preoperatively to 0.38 ± 0.33 (P &lt; 0.001) and 0.06 ± 0.12 (P &lt; 0.001) at 3-year follow-up. Mean spherical equivalent improved from -5.39 ± 3.89 diopters (D) preoperatively to -2.29 ± 2.65 D (P &lt; 0.001) at 3 years postoperatively. Mean corneal astigmatism reduced from -4.70 ± 2.86 D preoperatively to -3.55 ± 2.45 D (P = 0.001) at 3 years postoperatively. No ECD alterations were observed throughout the 3-year follow-up (P &gt; 0.05). Simultaneous t-PTK and conventional PRK followed by CXL seems to be an effective and safe treatment for progressive keratoconus over 3-year follow-up."

"Promoting vaccination for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially for high-risk groups such as the elderly and persons with comorbidities, is important for reducing the incidence of severe disease and death. Retrospective cross-sectional study of factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination, including previous influenza vaccination, among all persons who received medical services in a rural area in Crete, Greece, between October 2020-May 2021. Among 3129 participants, receipt of influenza vaccination in 2020-21 was strongly associated with COVID-19 vaccination, as was influenza vaccination in 2019-20, albeit to a lesser extent. In addition, persons older than 59 years (with exception of those 90 + years old) and those who lived closer to the hospital/health center, were more likely to vaccinate for COVID-19. Persons younger than 40 years of age, females, persons with mental illness or neurologic disease, were also less likely to vaccinate for COVID-19 (all p &lt; 0.001). COVID-19 vaccination was more likely among those who were vaccinated for influenza before and during the pandemic. Access to healthcare services and specific comorbidities, were important influencers for vaccination, underlying the importance of tailored interventions to enforce vaccination in high-risk groups."

Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) requires lengthy diagnostic procedures, typically available at tertiary Health Care Centers (HCC). This prospective study evaluated a flexible Machine Learning (ML) framework toward identifying persons with MCI or dementia based on information that can be readily available in a primary HC setting. Demographic and clinical data, informant ratings of recent behavioral changes, self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms, subjective cognitive complaints, and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were pooled from two aging cohorts from the island of Crete, Greece (N = 763 aged 60-93 years) comprising persons diagnosed with MCI (n = 277) or dementia (n = 153), and cognitively non-impaired persons (CNI, n = 333). A Balanced Random Forest Classifier was used for classification and variable importance-based feature selection in nested cross-validation schemes (CNI vs MCI, CNI vs Dementia, MCI vs Dementia). Global-level model-agnostic analyses identified predictors displaying nonlinear behavior. Local level agnostic analyses pinpointed key predictor variables for a given classification result after statistically controlling for all other predictors in the model. Classification of MCI vs CNI was achieved with improved sensitivity (74 %) and comparable specificity (73 %) compared to MMSE alone (37.2 % and 94.3 %, respectively). Additional high-ranking features included age, education, behavioral changes, multicomorbidity and polypharmacy. Higher classification accuracy was achieved for MCI vs Dementia (sensitivity/specificity = 87 %) and CNI vs Dementia (sensitivity/specificity = 94 %) using the same set of variables. Model agnostic analyses revealed notable individual variability in the contribution of specific variables toward a given classification result. Improved capacity to identify elderly with MCI can be achieved by combining demographic and medical information readily available at the PHC setting with MMSE scores, and informant ratings of behavioral changes. Explainability at the patient level may help clinicians identify specific predictor variables and patient scores to a given prediction outcome toward personalized risk assessment.

We present an updated time frame for the 30 m thick late Miocene sedimentary Trachilos section from the island of Crete that contains the potentially oldest hominin footprints. The section is characterized by normal magnetic polarity. New and published foraminifera biostratigraphy results suggest an age of the section within the Mediterranean biozone MMi13d, younger than ~ 6.4 Ma. Calcareous nannoplankton data from sediments exposed near Trachilos and belonging to the same sub-basin indicate deposition during calcareous nannofossil biozone CN9bB, between 6.023 and 6.727 Ma. By integrating the magneto- and biostratigraphic data we correlate the Trachilos section with normal polarity Chron C3An.1n, between 6.272 and 6.023 Ma. Using cyclostratigraphic data based on magnetic susceptibility, we constrain the Trachilos footprints age at ~ 6.05 Ma, roughly 0.35 Ma older than previously thought. Some uncertainty remains related to an inaccessible interval of ~ 8 m section and the possibility that the normal polarity might represent the slightly older Chron C3An.2n. Sediment accumulation rate and biostratigraphic arguments, however, stand against these points and favor a deposition during Chron C3An.1n.

The Neolithic and Bronze Ages were highly transformative periods for the genetic history of Europe but for the Aegean-a region fundamental to Europe's prehistory-the biological dimensions of cultural transitions have been elucidated only to a limited extent so far. We have analysed newly generated genome-wide data from 102 ancient individuals from Crete, the Greek mainland and the Aegean Islands, spanning from the Neolithic to the Iron Age. We found that the early farmers from Crete shared the same ancestry as other contemporaneous Neolithic Aegeans. In contrast, the end of the Neolithic period and the following Early Bronze Age were marked by 'eastern' gene flow, which was predominantly of Anatolian origin in Crete. Confirming previous findings for additional Central/Eastern European ancestry in the Greek mainland by the Middle Bronze Age, we additionally show that such genetic signatures appeared in Crete gradually from the seventeenth to twelfth centuries BC, a period when the influence of the mainland over the island intensified. Biological and cultural connectedness within the Aegean is also supported by the finding of consanguineous endogamy practiced at high frequencies, unprecedented in the global ancient DNA record. Our results highlight the potential of archaeogenomic approaches in the Aegean for unravelling the interplay of genetic admixture, marital and other cultural practices.

Mediterranean ports are sources of significant economic activity and at the same time they act as recipients of considerable anthropogenic disturbance and pollution. Polluted and low-in-oxygen sediments can negatively impact benthic biodiversity and favour recruitment of opportunistic or invasive species. Macrobenthic communities are an important component of the port biota and can be used as environmental quality indicators. However, a baseline database for benthic biodiversity in Mediterranean ports has not yet been widely established. Macrobenthic assemblages were recorded in three Mediterranean touristic ports under the framework of the ENPI CBC MED project MAPMED (MAnagement of Port Areas in the MEDiterranean Sea Basin). Samples were collected from Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy), Heraklion (Crete, Greece) and El Kantaoui (Tunisia) ports during February, May and September 2012. The sampling stations were selected according to the different sectors within each port (i.e. leisure, fishing, passenger/cargo vessels and shipyard). A total of 277 taxa belonging to 12 phyla were found, of which the 96 taxa were present in all three ports. El Kantaoui port hosted the highest number of macrobenthic taxa. Mollusca were the most abundant group (34%) in all ports. The highest percentage of opportunistic taxa per station was found before the touristic period in the shipyard of Heraklion port (89.3%).

To investigate whether mild forms of placenta creta (MPC) are more common in placentas delivered by cesarean section for non-anatomical indications than in placentas from vaginal deliveries. This is a retrospective clinical study in which MPC was diagnosed histologically by the presence of myometrial fibers in the decidua basalis or parietalis or in direct contact with the Rohr fibrinoid or chorionic villi. After excluding 111 cases at high risk for anatomical PC, placentas from 830 consecutive cesarean deliveries (group 1) were retrospectively statistically compared with 907 placentas from vaginal deliveries (group 2). Statistically significant differences were found in six independent clinical and seven placental phenotypes. More frequently, pre-eclampsia, abnormal fetal heart rate tracing and umbilical artery Dopplers, hypercoiled umbilical cord, diffuse postuterine pattern of chronic hypoxic placental injury, and clusters of avascular or mineralized chorionic villi were found in group 1, while preterm delivery, induction of labor, and histological patterns related to stillbirth were observed in group 2. MPC diagnosed in placentas from cesarean sections performed for non-anatomical indications is not statistically significantly more common than in those after vaginal delivery. Therefore, MPC may feature similar diagnostic correlations and portend a similar prognosis for future pregnancies.

The study involved two geographically isolated populations originating from Chania (Crete, most southern part of Greece), and Palaio Faliro (Athens, Central Greece). We exposed different cohorts of F3 adults of the above two populations that emerged from field collected eggs to ""winter condition"" from November 2018 to beginning of January 2019. in a protected microclimatic environment. Adult mortality was recorded systematically until the death of the last individual in the cohort. Results demonstrated evidence of winter survival of adults for both populations. Longevity of both females and males of the Palaio Faliro population was longer than that of the Chania population for almost all installation dates. Survival curves, regardless of the date of installation, were steeper for females of the Chania population compared to those from Palaio Faliro. In conclusion, overwinter survival of both populations in the adult stage highlights the need for future studies, considering local and microclimatic condition that vary significantly between regions. Winter climatic conditions play vital role in adult survival of this highly important public health species concerning distribution limits and knowledge on winter survival of Ae. albopictus transmitted viruses."

In our study, attitudes and perceptions of adult primary health care users regarding COVID-19 vaccination were evaluated. A single-center, cross-sectional study was conducted during a 1-year period (March 2021-March 2022) in a rural area in Crete, Greece. A sample of 626 self-reported questionnaires was collected at the end of the study period. Overall, 78% of respondents stated that they had received the COVID-19 vaccine. The reasons behind vaccine uptake were mainly personal beliefs and the desire to avoid professional constraints. The presence of diabetes type 2, fear of infection, and high perceived efficacy of vaccine previous flu vaccination, living with vulnerable persons, and the influence of scientific information were all significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. On the contrary, unwillingness and/or uncertainty to be vaccinated was associated with fear of vaccine side effects, information insufficiency, media/internet information, older age, the presence of inflammatory arthritis, previous COVID-19 infection, the belief that infection confers much greater immunity than the vaccine, and attitudes against vaccinations in general were predictors against COVID-19 vaccination. In conclusion, taking into account all of the above predictors and particularly those regarding safety and vaccine effectiveness may guide future strategies appropriately tailored to specific characteristics and needs of different geographic populations.

The Neolithic and Bronze Ages were highly transformative periods for the genetic history of Europe but for the Aegean-a region fundamental to Europe's prehistory-the biological dimensions of cultural transitions have been elucidated only to a limited extent so far. We have analysed newly generated genome-wide data from 102 ancient individuals from Crete, the Greek mainland and the Aegean Islands, spanning from the Neolithic to the Iron Age. We found that the early farmers from Crete shared the same ancestry as other contemporaneous Neolithic Aegeans. In contrast, the end of the Neolithic period and the following Early Bronze Age were marked by 'eastern' gene flow, which was predominantly of Anatolian origin in Crete. Confirming previous findings for additional Central/Eastern European ancestry in the Greek mainland by the Middle Bronze Age, we additionally show that such genetic signatures appeared in Crete gradually from the seventeenth to twelfth centuries BC, a period when the influence of the mainland over the island intensified. Biological and cultural connectedness within the Aegean is also supported by the finding of consanguineous endogamy practiced at high frequencies, unprecedented in the global ancient DNA record. Our results highlight the potential of archaeogenomic approaches in the Aegean for unravelling the interplay of genetic admixture, marital and other cultural practices.

"Overwintering capacity is a major step towards establishment of invasive mosquitoes from the tropics in temperate zone areas and one of the main elements determining next seasons' population size that regulates disease transmission of competent invasive vector species. The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culiciidae) is an aggressive invasive species that has greatly expanded its geographical boundaries over the last few decades. The species' ability to induce photoperiodic-based egg diapause allows its overwintering in temperate regions, which favors its establishment in higher latitudes. In warmer temperate areas winter survival can be accomplished in the adult stage as well especially in human-made shelters. Aedes albopictus is already showing signs of adaptation to colder climates which may result in disease transmission in new areas. Although the Asian tiger mosquito has invaded Greece since 2003-4, little is known regarding its overwintering capacity in the country, especially as far as adults are regarded. We studied the survival of Ae. albopictus adults during winter in a protected shelter in Athens, the capital city of Greece. The study involved two geographically isolated populations originating from Chania (Crete, most southern part of Greece), and Palaio Faliro (Athens, Central Greece). We exposed different cohorts of F3 adults of the above two populations that emerged from field collected eggs to ""winter condition"" from November 2018 to beginning of January 2019. in a protected microclimatic environment. Adult mortality was recorded systematically until the death of the last individual in the cohort. Results demonstrated evidence of winter survival of adults for both populations. Longevity of both females and males of the Palaio Faliro population was longer than that of the Chania population for almost all installation dates. Survival curves, regardless of the date of installation, were steeper for females of the Chania population compared to those from Palaio Faliro. In conclusion, overwinter survival of both populations in the adult stage highlights the need for future studies, considering local and microclimatic condition that vary significantly between regions. Winter climatic conditions play vital role in adult survival of this highly important public health species concerning distribution limits and knowledge on winter survival of Ae. albopictus transmitted viruses."

More frequently, pre-eclampsia, abnormal fetal heart rate tracing and umbilical artery Dopplers, hypercoiled umbilical cord, diffuse postuterine pattern of chronic hypoxic placental injury, and clusters of avascular or mineralized chorionic villi were found in group 1, while preterm delivery, induction of labor, and histological patterns related to stillbirth were observed in group 2. MPC diagnosed in placentas from cesarean sections performed for non-anatomical indications is not statistically significantly more common than in those after vaginal delivery.

The objective of this article is to assess the adherence of pregnant women to the national recommendations for influenza and pertussis vaccination and the reasons behind their non-adherence. This was a retrospective observational study conducted in a well-defined puerperant population of adequate healthcare standards from December 2018 to December 2019. The study was carried out with 1006 puerperants and 66 health care practitioners. Data were collected, including demographic-obstetric features of pregnant women, whether they received antenatal vaccination, the reasons for having been vaccinated or not as well as health professional's opinion regarding antenatal immunization. The uptake of influenza and pertussis vaccine during pregnancy was suboptimal with lack of recommendation of the vaccine by the healthcare providers being the main barrier. Factors positively associated with antenatal vaccination against influenza were higher level of maternal education and advanced maternal age while antenatal vaccination against pertussis was positively associated with higher level of maternal education. This large-scale retrospective study reveals the inadequacy of antenatal vaccination rates against pertussis and influenza in Crete, Greece. Results suggest that obstetricians' confidence in vaccination is of outmost importance for implementing immunization in pregnancy and any doubts on vaccine effectiveness and safety should be resolved. Routine antenatal vaccination counseling and pregnancy immunization campaigns are essential to improve vaccine uptake during pregnancy.

"Brain tumors are diagnosed and classified manually and noninvasively by radiologists using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The risk of misdiagnosis may exist due to human factors such as lack of time, fatigue, and relatively low experience. Deep learning methods have become increasingly important in MRI classification. To improve diagnostic accuracy, researchers emphasize the need to develop Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) computational diagnostics based on artificial intelligence (AI) systems by using deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and improving the performance of CNN by combining it with other data analysis tools such as wavelet transform. In this study, a novel diagnostic framework based on CNN and DWT data analysis is developed for the diagnosis of glioma tumors in the brain, among other tumors and other diseases, with T2-SWI MRI scans. It is a binary CNN classifier that treats the disease ""glioma tumor"" as positive and the other pathologies as negative, resulting in a very unbalanced binary problem. The study includes a comparative analysis of a CNN trained with wavelet transform data of MRIs instead of their pixel intensity values in order to demonstrate the increased performance of the CNN and DWT analysis in diagnosing brain gliomas. The results of the proposed CNN architecture are also compared with a deep CNN pre-trained on VGG16 transfer learning network and with the SVM machine learning method using DWT knowledge. To improve the accuracy of the CNN classifier, the proposed CNN model uses as knowledge the spatial and temporal features extracted by converting the original MRI images to the frequency domain by performing Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), instead of the traditionally used original scans in the form of pixel intensities. Moreover, no pre-processing was applied to the original images. The images used are MRIs of type T2-SWI sequences parallel to the axial plane. Firstly, a compression step is applied for each MRI scan applying DWT up to three levels of decomposition. These data are used to train a 2D CNN in order to classify the scans as showing glioma or not. The proposed CNN model is trained on MRI slices originated from 382 various male and female adult patients, showing healthy and pathological images from a selection of diseases (showing glioma, meningioma, pituitary, necrosis, edema, non-enchasing tumor, hemorrhagic foci, edema, ischemic changes, cystic areas, etc.). The images are provided by the database of the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) and the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenges on Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenges 2016 and 2017, as well as by the numerous records kept in the public general hospital of Chania, Crete, ""Saint George"". The proposed frameworks are experimentally evaluated by examining MRI slices originating from 190 different patients (not included in the training set), of which 56% are showing gliomas by the longest two axes less than 2 cm and 44% are showing other pathological effects or healthy cases. Results show convincing performance when using as information the spatial and temporal features extracted by the original scans. With the proposed CNN model and with data in DWT format, we achieved the following statistic percentages: accuracy 0.97, sensitivity (recall) 1, specificity 0.93, precision 0.95, FNR 0, and FPR 0.07. These numbers are higher for this data format (respectively: accuracy by 6% higher, recall by 11%, specificity by 7%, precision by 5%, FNR by 0.1%, and FPR is the same) than it would be, had we used as input data the intensity values of the MRIs (instead of the DWT analysis of the MRIs). Additionally, our study showed that when our CNN takes into account the TL of the existing network VGG, the performance values are lower, as follows: accuracy 0.87, sensitivity (recall) 0.91, specificity 0.84, precision 0.86, FNR of 0.08, and FPR 0.14. The experimental results show the outperformance of the CNN, which is not based on transfer learning, but is using as information the MRI brain scans decomposed into DWT information instead of the pixel intensity of the original scans. The results are promising for the proposed CNN based on DWT knowledge to serve for binary diagnosis of glioma tumors among other tumors and diseases. Moreover, the SVM learning model using DWT data analysis performs with higher accuracy and sensitivity than using pixel values."

Earthquake nowcasting (EN) is a modern method of estimating seismic risk by evaluating the progress of the earthquake (EQ) cycle in fault systems. EN evaluation is based on a new concept of time, termed 'natural time'. EN employs natural time, and uniquely estimates seismic risk by means of the earthquake potential score (EPS), which has been found to have useful applications both regionally and globally. Amongst these applications, here we focused on Greece since 2019, for the estimation of the EPS for the largest-magnitude events, MW(USGS) ≥ 6, that occurred during our study period: for example, the MW= 6.0 WNW-of-Kissamos EQ on 27 November 2019, the MW= 6.5 off-shore Southern Crete EQ on 2 May 2020, the MW= 7.0 Samos EQ on 30 October 2020, the MW= 6.3 Tyrnavos EQ on 3 March 2021, the MW= 6.0 Arkalohorion Crete EQ on 27 September 2021, and the MW= 6.4 Sitia Crete EQ on 12 October 2021. The results are promising, and reveal that the EPS provides useful information on impending seismicity.

During grape cultivation and wine production, the most effective way to prevent ochratoxin A (OTA) contamination of grapes and wine is to control ochratoxigenic fungal species, especially Aspergillus carbonarius, using appropriate cultivation techniques. In this study, the influence of an organic farming system (OFS) and an integrated farming system (IFS) on the incidence of A. carbonarius on grapes, and OTA contamination of wine, were examined. Mycological analysis of grapes collected from Kotsifali cultivar (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyards and grown under two farming systems (OFS and IFS) was performed over two growing seasons. For the same two growing seasons, OTA levels of representative wine samples from wineries located in the same area, made from the same cultivar (single varietal or covinificated with Mandilari), and grown under the two farming systems were determined. The results showed that the farming system had a significant influence on the incidence of A. carbonarius, with IFS being the most effective in the control of the fungus and the prevention of OTA occurrence in wine. This knowledge could offer viticulturists a useful tool to produce safer grapes, giving winemakers an incentive to make low-OTA wine.

"Constant exposure of health professionals to the pain and suffering of patients can adversely affect their emotional wellbeing. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence and the factors affecting the levels of secondary traumatic stress/compassion fatigue (STS/CF), burnout (BO) and compassion satisfaction (CS) of health professionals working in adult and paediatric Intensive Care Units (ICU) as well as in departments treating patients with serious illness in five hospitals in Crete. A descriptive cross-sectional survey with the use of the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL-CSF-R-IV) questionnaire. We enrolled medical, nursing and support staff working in the adult and paediatric ICU, emergency, oncology, haematology and neurosurgical departments, haemodialysis unit and operating theatre. 598 health professionals completed the questionnaire (response rate 73.2%). Significantly increased levels of STS/CF were observed in non - ICU as compared to ICU staff (p = .009) females compared to males (p &lt; .001), those who have previously experienced a traumatic event (p &lt; .004), nurses and support staff compared to doctors (p = .007 and p = .028 respectively), and people not working in a department by choice (p &lt; .001). CS was higher for older professionals, personnel subjected to stress reduction techniques (p &lt; .019) and professionals working with children or mixed adults and children population (p = .009). Rolling schedule and bad working conditions negatively affected CS (p = .02, p = .001). Increased BO levels were associated with younger age (p = .029) and showed a positive correlation with STS/CF (r = .356, p &lt; .001). STS/CF is common in health professionals regardless of their profession, working department or hospital level. Non-ICU staff displayed higher STS/CF levels. Working in a department by choice ameliorates CS, BO and STS/CF. Health professionals need to be informed about the risks of projecting patients' suffering on themselves. Hospital managers and department heads are responsible to provide appropriate support."

"Brain tumors are diagnosed and classified manually and noninvasively by radiologists using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The risk of misdiagnosis may exist due to human factors such as lack of time, fatigue, and relatively low experience. Deep learning methods have become increasingly important in MRI classification. To improve diagnostic accuracy, researchers emphasize the need to develop Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) computational diagnostics based on artificial intelligence (AI) systems by using deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and improving the performance of CNN by combining it with other data analysis tools such as wavelet transform. In this study, a novel diagnostic framework based on CNN and DWT data analysis is developed for the diagnosis of glioma tumors in the brain, among other tumors and other diseases, with T2-SWI MRI scans. It is a binary CNN classifier that treats the disease ""glioma tumor"" as positive and the other pathologies as negative, resulting in a very unbalanced binary problem. The study includes a comparative analysis of a CNN trained with wavelet transform data of MRIs instead of their pixel intensity values in order to demonstrate the increased performance of the CNN and DWT analysis in diagnosing brain gliomas. The results of the proposed CNN architecture are also compared with a deep CNN pre-trained on VGG16 transfer learning network and with the SVM machine learning method using DWT knowledge. To improve the accuracy of the CNN classifier, the proposed CNN model uses as knowledge the spatial and temporal features extracted by converting the original MRI images to the frequency domain by performing Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), instead of the traditionally used original scans in the form of pixel intensities. Moreover, no pre-processing was applied to the original images. The images used are MRIs of type T2-SWI sequences parallel to the axial plane. Firstly, a compression step is applied for each MRI scan applying DWT up to three levels of decomposition.

"The aim of the present study was to explore the associations between visual outcomes of ocular injury patients in a tertiary hospital unit with clinical and demographic variables and to evaluate the psychosocial impact of the injury on the patients. An 18-month prospective study of 30 eye-injured adult patients was conducted in the General University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, a tertiary referral hospital. All severe eye injury case information was prospectively collected between February 1, 2020 and August 31, 2021. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was labelled not poor (&gt;0.5/10 or &gt;20/400 on the Snellen scale, &lt;1.3 in LogMAR scale) and poor (≤0.5/10 or ≤20/400 on the Snellen scale, ≥1.3 on the LogMAR equivalent). Data regarding participants' perceived stress levels, by using Perceived Stress Scale 14 (PSS-14), were collected prospectively, one year after study end. Out of 30 ocular injury patients selected, 76.7% were men and most of them were self-employed and private or public sector workers (36.7%). Not poor final BCVA was related to not poor initial BCVA [odds ratio (OR) 1.714; P=0.006]. No statistical associations were found between visual outcome and demographic or clinical factors, but not poor final BCVA was associated with improved self-reported psychological condition of the sufferers, as examined by a questionnaire sheet developed to collect information for study purpose (8.36/10 vs. 6.40/10; P=0.011). No patient reported job loss or changed work status following the injury. Not poor initial BCVA was a significant predictor for not poor final visual outcomes (OR 1.714; P=0.006). Patients with not poor final BCVA expressed higher levels of positive psychology (8.36/10 vs. 6.40/10; P=0.011) and less fear of eye injury repetition (64.0 vs. 100.0%; P=0.286). Not poor final BCVA was associated with low PSS-14 scores one year after study end (77.3 vs. 0.0%, P=0.003).

The Neolithic and Bronze Ages were highly transformative periods for the genetic history of Europe but for the Aegean-a region fundamental to Europe's prehistory-the biological dimensions of cultural transitions have been elucidated only to a limited extent so far. We have analysed newly generated genome-wide data from 102 ancient individuals from Crete, the Greek mainland and the Aegean Islands, spanning from the Neolithic to the Iron Age. We found that the early farmers from Crete shared the same ancestry as other contemporaneous Neolithic Aegeans. In contrast, the end of the Neolithic period and the following Early Bronze Age were marked by 'eastern' gene flow, which was predominantly of Anatolian origin in Crete. Confirming previous findings for additional Central/Eastern European ancestry in the Greek mainland by the Middle Bronze Age, we additionally show that such genetic signatures appeared in Crete gradually from the seventeenth to twelfth centuries BC, a period when the influence of the mainland over the island intensified. Biological and cultural connectedness within the Aegean is also supported by the finding of consanguineous endogamy practiced at high frequencies, unprecedented in the global ancient DNA record. Our results highlight the potential of archaeogenomic approaches in the Aegean for unravelling the interplay of genetic admixture, marital and other cultural practices.

"Bacterial antibiotic resistance (AMR) is a significant threat to public health, with the sentinel 'ESKAPEE' pathogens, being of particular concern. A cohort study spanning 5.5 years (2016-2021) was conducted at a provincial general hospital in Crete, Greece, to describe the epidemiology of ESKAPEE-associated bacteraemia regarding levels of AMR and their impact on patient outcomes. In total, 239 bloodstream isolates were examined from 226 patients (0.7% of 32 996 admissions) with a median age of 75 years, 28% of whom had severe comorbidity and 46% with prior stay in ICU. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was lowest for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (30%) and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (33%), and highest among <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (97%); the latter included 8 (22%) with extensive drug-resistance (XDR), half of which were resistant to all antibiotics tested.

"Bacterial antibiotic resistance (AMR) is a significant threat to public health, with the sentinel 'ESKAPEE' pathogens, being of particular concern. A cohort study spanning 5.5 years (2016-2021) was conducted at a provincial general hospital in Crete, Greece, to describe the epidemiology of ESKAPEE-associated bacteraemia regarding levels of AMR and their impact on patient outcomes. In total, 239 bloodstream isolates were examined from 226 patients (0.7% of 32 996 admissions) with a median age of 75 years, 28% of whom had severe comorbidity and 46% with prior stay in ICU. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was lowest for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (30%) and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (33%), and highest among <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (97%); the latter included 8 (22%) with extensive drug-resistance (XDR), half of which were resistant to all antibiotics tested. MDR bacteraemia was more likely to be healthcare-associated than community-onset (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04-2.65).

"Overwintering capacity is a major step towards establishment of invasive mosquitoes from the tropics in temperate zone areas and one of the main elements determining next seasons' population size that regulates disease transmission of competent invasive vector species. The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culiciidae) is an aggressive invasive species that has greatly expanded its geographical boundaries over the last few decades. The species' ability to induce photoperiodic-based egg diapause allows its overwintering in temperate regions, which favors its establishment in higher latitudes. In warmer temperate areas winter survival can be accomplished in the adult stage as well especially in human-made shelters. Aedes albopictus is already showing signs of adaptation to colder climates which may result in disease transmission in new areas. Although the Asian tiger mosquito has invaded Greece since 2003-4, little is known regarding its overwintering capacity in the country, especially as far as adults are regarded. We studied the survival of Ae. albopictus adults during winter in a protected shelter in Athens, the capital city of Greece. The study involved two geographically isolated populations originating from Chania (Crete, most southern part of Greece), and Palaio Faliro (Athens, Central Greece). We exposed different cohorts of F3 adults of the above two populations that emerged from field collected eggs to ""winter condition"" from November 2018 to beginning of January 2019. in a protected microclimatic environment. Adult mortality was recorded systematically until the death of the last individual in the cohort. Results demonstrated evidence of winter survival of adults for both populations. Longevity of both females and males of the Palaio Faliro population was longer than that of the Chania population for almost all installation dates. Survival curves, regardless of the date of installation, were steeper for females of the Chania population compared to those from Palaio Faliro. In conclusion, overwinter survival of both populations in the adult stage highlights the need for future studies, considering local and microclimatic condition that vary significantly between regions.

"Sixty-two samples of Pichtogalo Chanion cheese traditionally produced in Crete, a few (3 to 6) days old, were analyzed for some chemical and bacteriological characteristics. The results of physicochemical analyses were as follows: (1) moisture content 61.63% (standard deviation 4.67); (2) fat in dry matter 54.03% (SD 7.73); (3) protein content 14.23% (SD 1.72); (4) salt content 1.02% (SD 0.38); (5) water activity (aw) 0.990 (SD 0.003); and (6) pH 4.36 (SD 0.25). None of the samples yielded Salmonella spp. Listeria monocytogenes and coagulase-positive staphylococci were present in 6.45% of the samples. Bacillus cereus and sulfite-reducing clostridia were isolated from 14.51% and 40.32% of the samples, respectively. High populations of coliforms were determined in the cheese samples. In 11.3% of the samples, Escherichia coli was not detected, while 88.7% of the samples yielded E. coli most probable number levels from 1.32 to 5.66 log10/g. The log10 CFU/g counts of enterococci were 6.89 (SD 0.84), of yeasts 6.79 (SD 0.61), of molds 4.68 (SD 0.69), and of psychrotrophic bacteria 7.63 (SD 0.62). The log10 CFU/g counts of lactic acid streptococci and lactococci were 7.91 (SD 0.68) and of lactobacilli 8.11 (SD 0.65). Lactic acid bacteria, mainly mesophilic, were isolated and confirmed using API 50 CH test trips. A pasteurized mixture of ewe's and goat's milk was made into Pichtogalo Chanion cheese according to standard procedure at 23 degrees C, after the addition of 4% commercial mesophilic starter culture or 2%, 3%, and 4% starter culture of the isolated and confirmed lactic acid bacteria and the addition of rennet. Results of this work indicated that high quality of Pichtogalo Chanion cheese can be produced using a pasteurized mixture of ewe's and goat's milk and 4% (vol/vol) of mesophilic starter culture."

"Constant exposure of health professionals to the pain and suffering of patients can adversely affect their emotional wellbeing. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence and the factors affecting the levels of secondary traumatic stress/compassion fatigue (STS/CF), burnout (BO) and compassion satisfaction (CS) of health professionals working in adult and paediatric Intensive Care Units (ICU) as well as in departments treating patients with serious illness in five hospitals in Crete. A descriptive cross-sectional survey with the use of the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL-CSF-R-IV) questionnaire. We enrolled medical, nursing and support staff working in the adult and paediatric ICU, emergency, oncology, haematology and neurosurgical departments, haemodialysis unit and operating theatre. 598 health professionals completed the questionnaire (response rate 73.2%). Significantly increased levels of STS/CF were observed in non - ICU as compared to ICU staff (p = .009) females compared to males (p &lt; .001), those who have previously experienced a traumatic event (p &lt; .004), nurses and support staff compared to doctors (p = .007 and p = .028 respectively), and people not working in a department by choice (p &lt; .001). CS was higher for older professionals, personnel subjected to stress reduction techniques (p &lt; .019) and professionals working with children or mixed adults and children population (p = .009). Rolling schedule and bad working conditions negatively affected CS (p = .02, p = .001). Increased BO levels were associated with younger age (p = .029) and showed a positive correlation with STS/CF (r = .356, p &lt; .001). STS/CF is common in health professionals regardless of their profession, working department or hospital level. Non-ICU staff displayed higher STS/CF levels. Working in a department by choice ameliorates CS, BO and STS/CF. Health professionals need to be informed about the risks of projecting patients' suffering on themselves. Hospital managers and department heads are responsible to provide appropriate support."

"Purpose: To identify the effect of frailty and geriatric syndromes on the quality of life (QoL), of older adults receiving home care, taking into consideration their socioeconomic and homebound status, including multi-comorbidities. Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled elders aged (≥65) years old, registered members of “Help at Home” programs in the Reference Region of Crete, from March to May 2019. Participants were screened using the WHOQOL-BREF for Quality of Life, geriatric syndromes such as frailty using the SHARE-Frailty Index (SHARE-Fi), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), for cognitive function and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), for the assessment of depression. Results: The mean age of the 301 participants was 78.45 (±7.87) years old. The prevalence of frailty was 38.5%, severe depression 13.6%, cognitive dysfunction 87.8% and severe comorbidity 70.6%. Intriguingly, none of the participants (0%) was identified as free of comorbidity (CCI = 0−1). The overall QoL (ranging from 4−20) of the study participants was 13.24 (±4.09). The bivariate analysis showed that overall QoL significantly differed among older adults with frailty (15.91 vs. 11.56, p &lt; 0.001), cognitive dysfunction (15.42 vs. 12.90, p &lt; 0.001), depression (14.90 vs. 9.31, p &lt; 0.001), and disability in Activities of Daily Living (13.67 vs. 10.67, p = 0.002), compared to non-frail, normal cognition and depression, and independent elders, respectively. Multiple linear regression models revealed that frail and depressive elders reported significantly lower QoL (β = −2.65, p &lt; 0.001 and (β = −5.71, p &lt; 0.001), compared to non-frail and older adults with no depressive symptoms, respectively, despite the fact that this association was not significant for older adults with dementia (β = −2.25, p = 0.159), even after adjusting for potential confounding effects (age, gender, comorbidity, homebound status, etc.). Conclusion: frailty and geriatric syndromes including comorbidities are important risk factors for “poor” QoL among older adults receiving home-based healthcare."

"Background and Objectives: Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) appears to have a higher prevalence in diabetics and has been associated with various genetic polymorphisms of the innate immune system. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the C1q gene that encodes for the trigger molecule of the classical complement pathway increase the risk of bacterial infections as well as other diseases. In the present study, we sought to investigate the association of C1q rs292001 (G &gt; A) SNP with ASB in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, performed at the University and the Venizeleion General Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, 75 adult male and female Cretan patients with T2D and ASB and 75 adult male and female Cretan patients with T2D but without ASB were enrolled and genotyped for rs292001 SNP of C1q gene. Genetic analysis was based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RLFPs) methods. Results: Τhe frequency of homozygotes for the G/G genotype of C1q rs292001 was significantly higher in patients with T2D and ASB than in the control group (p-value = 0.0480, OR = 2.952, 95% CI: 1.052−7.542). Conclusions: Τhe present study provides the first evidence of an association between the C1q rs292001 SNP and an increased susceptibility for ASB in an adult Cretan population with T2D, thus suggesting that this SNP can be encountered as a risk factor for the presence of ASB in patients with T2D."

"(1) Background: There is evidence in the recent literature that the incidence patterns of colorectal cancer (CRC) have changed considerably over the years, tending to rise rapidly in individuals under 50 years old compared with those over 50 years. The current study aimed to assess the incidence of CRC in Crete from 1992−2021 and compare them among younger and older adults. (2) Methods: Data on malignant neoplasms of colon, rectosigmoid junction, and rectum have been extracted from the database of the Regional Cancer Registry of Crete. (3) Results: The number of these cases for the period 1992−2021 was 3857 (n = 2895 colon and n = 962 rectum). The mean age-specific incidence rate (ASpIR/100,000/year) of colon cancer patients &lt;50 years was 7.2 (95% CI 5.1−9.7), while for patients ≥50 years the ASpIR was 149 (95% CI 146.2−153.4). ASpIR presented a 29.6% increase from 2001 to 2011 in the age group of 20−34 years and further increase is expected from 2022−2030 (projected change, 42.8%). The main risk factors were the pack years (p = 0.01), alcohol consumption (0.02), and farmer occupation (0.04), especially during 2012−2021. (4) Conclusions: We confirmed an increased incidence of CRC in young adults &lt;50 in a European population with low cancer incidence in the past and a worrisome prediction for the near future. The observed trends clearly indicate that starting CRC screening at an earlier age may be essential."

"Purpose: To evaluate frailty and its relationship with geriatric syndromes in the context of socioeconomic variables. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, elderly people aged 65 years old and over who received homecare in the reference region of Crete, Greece, were enrolled. Geriatric syndromes such as frailty, dementia, and depression were evaluated using the SHARE-Frailty Index (SHARE-Fi), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), respectively. Level of education, annual individual income, disability in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and homebound status were also assessed as ‘socioeconomic factors.’ Results: The mean age of 301 participants was 78.45 (±7.87) years old. A proportion of 38.5% was identified as frail. A multiple logistic regression model revealed that elderly people with cognitive dysfunction were more likely to be frail (OR = 1.65; 95% CI: 0.55−4.98, p = 0.469) compared to those with normal cognition, but this association was not significant. Although elderly people with mild depression were significantly more likely to be frail (OR = 2.62; CI: 1.33−5.17, p = 0.005) compared to those with normal depression, the association for elderly people with severe depression (OR = 2.05, CI: 0.80−5.24, p = 0.134) was not significant. Additionally, comorbidity (OR = 1.06, CI: 0.49−2.27, p = 0.876) was not associated with frailty, suggesting that comorbidity is not a risk factor for frailty. In addition, patients with mild depression were significantly more likely to report frailty (OR = 2.62, CI:1.33−5.17, p = 0.005) compared to those with normal depression, whereas elders with an annual individual income (&gt;EUR 4500) were less likely to be frail (OR = 0.45, CI: 0.25−0.83, p = 0.011) compared to those with &lt;EUR 4500 per year. Conclusions: Our data analysis shows that higher annual individual income and mild depression were independently associated with frailty, suggesting that a lower poverty threshold and mild depression are risk factors for frailty."

"Identifying modifiable factors that may predict long-term cognitive decline in the elderly with adequate daily functionality is critical. Such factors may include poor sleep quality and quantity, sleep-related breathing disorders, inflammatory cytokines and stress hormones, as well as mental health problems. This work reports the methodology and descriptive characteristics of a long-term, multidisciplinary study on modifiable risk factors for cognitive status progression, focusing on the 7-year follow-up. Participants were recruited from a large community-dwelling cohort residing in Crete, Greece (CAC; Cretan Aging Cohort). Baseline assessments were conducted in 2013-2014 (Phase I and II, circa 6-month time interval) and follow-up in 2020-2022 (Phase III). In total, 151 individuals completed the Phase III evaluation. Of those, 71 were cognitively non-impaired (CNI group) in Phase II and 80 had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In addition to sociodemographic, lifestyle, medical, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric data, objective sleep was assessed based on actigraphy (Phase II and III) and home polysomnography (Phase III), while inflammation markers and stress hormones were measured in both phases. Despite the homogeneity of the sample in most sociodemographic indices, MCI persons were significantly older (mean age = 75.03 years, SD = 6.34) and genetically predisposed for cognitive deterioration (APOE ε4 allele carriership). Also, at follow-up, we detected a significant increase in self-reported anxiety symptoms along with a substantial rise in psychotropic medication use and incidence of major medical morbidities. The longitudinal design of the CAC study may provide significant data on possible modifiable factors in the course of cognitive progression in the community-dwelling elderly."

Oxidative damages are responsible for many adverse health effects and food deterioration. The use of antioxidant substances is well renowned, and as such, much emphasis is placed on their use. Since synthetic antioxidants exhibit potential adverse effects, plant-derived antioxidants are a preferable solution. Despite the myriads of plants that exist and the fact that numerous studies have been carried out so far, there are many species that have not been examined so far. Many plants under research exist in Greece. Trying to fill this research gap, the total phenolics content and antioxidant activity of seventy methanolic extracts from parts of Greek plants were evaluated. The total phenolics content was measured by the Folin-Ciocalteau assay. Their antioxidant capacity was calculated by the 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging test, the Rancimat method based on conductometric measurements, and the thermoanalytical method DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry). The tested samples were obtained from several parts of fifty-seven Greek plant species belonging to twenty-three different families. Both a remarkably high phenolic content (with gallic acid equivalents varying between 311.6 and 735.5 mg/g of extract) and radical scavenging activity (IC<sub>50</sub> values ranged from 7.2 to 39.0 μg/mL) were found in the extract of the aerial parts of <i>Cistus</i> species (<i>C. creticus</i> subsp. <i>creticus</i>, <i>C. creticus</i> subsp. <i>eriocephalus</i>, <i>C. monspeliensis</i>, <i>C. parviflorus</i> and <i>C. salviifolius</i>), <i>Cytinus</i> taxa (<i>C. hypocistis</i> subsp. <i>hypocistis</i>, <i>C. hypocistis</i> subsp. <i>orientalis</i> and <i>C. ruber</i>), and <i>Sarcopoterium spinosum</i>. Furthermore, the sample of <i>Cytinus ruber</i> showed the highest protection factor (PF = 1.276) regarding the Rancimat method, which was similar to that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (PF = 1.320). The results indicated that these plants are rich in antioxidant compounds, potentiating their use either as food additives to enhance the antioxidant properties of food products, or protect them from oxidation, or as sources for the preparation of food supplements with antioxidant properties.

The profile analysis involved a categorization ascended from an evaluation process conducted by pre-service early childhood teachers' (<i>n2 =</i> 295) at the University of Crete, Greece, using a new instrument, validated in the present research, the ETEA-2 scale. The categorization criteria were the five dimensions of the ETEA-2: Learning, Suitability, Usability, Security, and Parental Control. The classification based on Latent Class Analysis led to three apps' profiles: Cluster/profile 1 includes apps that have high values in Learning, Usability, Suitability, and medium Parental Control and Security; Cluster/Profile 2 includes apps with medium Learning, Usability, Suitability, but low Parental Control and High Security; Cluster/Profile 3 includes apps with medium Learning, Usability, Suitability, but low Parental Control and low Security. This profile scheme is an indicative categorization summarizing the crucial features that popular apps possess and can help parents and/or educators' decision-making on choosing the desirable application for their kids. Moreover, from an independent evaluation of these specific fifty apps sought on the internet, the members of Cluster2/Profile 2 were the most popular and preferable, as suggested by the number of downloads. This profile is distinguished for the security dimension."

"Insecticide resistance has emerged in various western flower thrips (WFT) populations across the world, threatening the efficiency of chemical control applications. Elucidation of insecticide resistance mechanisms at the molecular level provides markers for the development of diagnostics to monitor the trait and support evidence-based resistance management. TaqMan and Droplet Digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) diagnostics were developed and validated, against Sanger sequencing, in individual and pooled WFT samples respectively, for the G275E mutation (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α6 gene, nAChR α6) associated with resistance to nAChR allosteric modulators, site I (spinosyns); L1014F, T929I, T929C and T292V mutations (voltage-gated sodium channel gene, vgsc) linked with pyrethroid resistance; and I1017M (chitin synthase 1 gene, chs1) conferring resistance to growth inhibitors affecting CHS1 (benzoylureas). The detection limits of ddPCR assays for mutant allelic frequencies (MAF) were in the range of 0.1%-0.2%. The assays were applied in nine WFT field populations from Crete, Greece.

"Identifying modifiable factors that may predict long-term cognitive decline in the elderly with adequate daily functionality is critical. Such factors may include poor sleep quality and quantity, sleep-related breathing disorders, inflammatory cytokines and stress hormones, as well as mental health problems. This work reports the methodology and descriptive characteristics of a long-term, multidisciplinary study on modifiable risk factors for cognitive status progression, focusing on the 7-year follow-up. Participants were recruited from a large community-dwelling cohort residing in Crete, Greece (CAC; Cretan Aging Cohort). Baseline assessments were conducted in 2013-2014 (Phase I and II, circa 6-month time interval) and follow-up in 2020-2022 (Phase III). In total, 151 individuals completed the Phase III evaluation. Of those, 71 were cognitively non-impaired (CNI group) in Phase II and 80 had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In addition to sociodemographic, lifestyle, medical, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric data, objective sleep was assessed based on actigraphy (Phase II and III) and home polysomnography (Phase III), while inflammation markers and stress hormones were measured in both phases. Despite the homogeneity of the sample in most sociodemographic indices, MCI persons were significantly older (mean age = 75.03 years, SD = 6.34) and genetically predisposed for cognitive deterioration (APOE ε4 allele carriership). Also, at follow-up, we detected a significant increase in self-reported anxiety symptoms along with a substantial rise in psychotropic medication use and incidence of major medical morbidities. The longitudinal design of the CAC study may provide significant data on possible modifiable factors in the course of cognitive progression in the community-dwelling elderly."

Oxidative damages are responsible for many adverse health effects and food deterioration. The use of antioxidant substances is well renowned, and as such, much emphasis is placed on their use. Since synthetic antioxidants exhibit potential adverse effects, plant-derived antioxidants are a preferable solution. Despite the myriads of plants that exist and the fact that numerous studies have been carried out so far, there are many species that have not been examined so far. Many plants under research exist in Greece. Trying to fill this research gap, the total phenolics content and antioxidant activity of seventy methanolic extracts from parts of Greek plants were evaluated. The total phenolics content was measured by the Folin-Ciocalteau assay. Their antioxidant capacity was calculated by the 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging test, the Rancimat method based on conductometric measurements, and the thermoanalytical method DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry). The tested samples were obtained from several parts of fifty-seven Greek plant species belonging to twenty-three different families. Both a remarkably high phenolic content (with gallic acid equivalents varying between 311.6 and 735.5 mg/g of extract) and radical scavenging activity (IC<sub>50</sub> values ranged from 7.2 to 39.0 μg/mL) were found in the extract of the aerial parts of <i>Cistus</i> species (<i>C. creticus</i> subsp. <i>creticus</i>, <i>C. creticus</i> subsp. <i>eriocephalus</i>, <i>C. monspeliensis</i>, <i>C. parviflorus</i> and <i>C. salviifolius</i>), <i>Cytinus</i> taxa (<i>C. hypocistis</i> subsp. <i>hypocistis</i>, <i>C. hypocistis</i> subsp. <i>orientalis</i> and <i>C. ruber</i>), and <i>Sarcopoterium spinosum</i>. Furthermore, the sample of <i>Cytinus ruber</i> showed the highest protection factor (PF = 1.276) regarding the Rancimat method, which was similar to that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (PF = 1.320). The results indicated that these plants are rich in antioxidant compounds, potentiating their use either as food additives to enhance the antioxidant properties of food products, or protect them from oxidation, or as sources for the preparation of food supplements with antioxidant properties.

"Insecticide resistance has emerged in various western flower thrips (WFT) populations across the world, threatening the efficiency of chemical control applications. Elucidation of insecticide resistance mechanisms at the molecular level provides markers for the development of diagnostics to monitor the trait and support evidence-based resistance management. TaqMan and Droplet Digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) diagnostics were developed and validated, against Sanger sequencing, in individual and pooled WFT samples respectively, for the G275E mutation (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α6 gene, nAChR α6) associated with resistance to nAChR allosteric modulators, site I (spinosyns); L1014F, T929I, T929C and T292V mutations (voltage-gated sodium channel gene, vgsc) linked with pyrethroid resistance; and I1017M (chitin synthase 1 gene, chs1) conferring resistance to growth inhibitors affecting CHS1 (benzoylureas). The detection limits of ddPCR assays for mutant allelic frequencies (MAF) were in the range of 0.1%-0.2%. The assays were applied in nine WFT field populations from Crete, Greece.

Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides has evolved in Bactrocera oleae populations in Greece, threatening the efficacy of control interventions based on this insecticide class. Here we report the collection of populations from Crete, with resistance levels reaching up to 132-folds, compared to susceptible laboratory strains and show that pyrethroid resistance is substantially suppressed by the PBO synergist, suggesting the involvement of detoxification enzymes. To identify specific candidate genes implicated in resistance, we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis, between the pyrethroid resistant populations from Crete and the susceptible laboratory strains, using both whole bodies and Malpighian tubules. Several genes were found differentially transcribed between resistant and susceptible flies in each comparison, with P450s being among the most highly over-expressed detoxification genes in pyrethroid resistant populations. Four of the over-expressed P450s (Cyp6A61, Cyp6G6, Cyp4P6 and Cyp6G28) were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and in vitro metabolism assays revealed that CYP6A61 is capable of metabolizing alpha-cypermethrin, while CYP6G6, CYP4P6 and CYP6G28 are capable of metabolizing deltamethrin. No metabolism of neonicotinoid insecticides was recorded. We further silenced CYP6G6 in vivo, via RNAi, which led to a small, but significant increase in deltamethrin toxicity. The study provides valuable information towards the development of molecular diagnostics and evidence-based insecticide resistance management strategies.

The aim of this study was to extract and triangulate information on the demographic, clinical, and social features of eye-injured adult patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in Greece. The design was a five-year retrospective study of eye-injured adult patients, admitted to the General University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete (GUHH), the single tertiary referral hospital on the island. Drawing the profile of eye-injured patients may add to future health planning. Data collected from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2019, such as sociodemographic features and clinical information, were extracted. One hundred twenty-eight patients were included. Of those, there was no available information on activity during injury for 6 patients, 78 (60.9%) had work-related ocular injuries, and 44 (34.4%) had non-work-related ocular injuries. Patients with no current formal employment, those who were retired, and formally unemployed and manual force workers had the higher rates of work-related injuries. The most common work-related injuries were closed globe injuries, specifically contusions, while ruptures and penetrating wounds were the most frequent of the open globe injuries. Within the univariate analyses, work-related eye injuries were significantly associated with male gender, middle age, and the place related to daily work activity. Determinants of poor final visual acuity (VA) were the initial VA, the type of injury (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), the distance of the place of residence from the hospital, and the time to hospital admission (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.013). In a multivariate analysis, referred patients and those with open globe injuries arrived at hospital after a two-hour interval compared with those who were not referred and those with closed globe injuries (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). A reduction in the time to hospital admission deserves further attention. The interconnection of community and health system services through a capacity increase and networking needs further research in order to obtain targeted and viable access for eye-injured patients."

The profile analysis involved a categorization ascended from an evaluation process conducted by pre-service early childhood teachers' (<i>n2 =</i> 295) at the University of Crete, Greece, using a new instrument, validated in the present research, the ETEA-2 scale. The categorization criteria were the five dimensions of the ETEA-2: Learning, Suitability, Usability, Security, and Parental Control. The classification based on Latent Class Analysis led to three apps' profiles: Cluster/profile 1 includes apps that have high values in Learning, Usability, Suitability, and medium Parental Control and Security; Cluster/Profile 2 includes apps with medium Learning, Usability, Suitability, but low Parental Control and High Security; Cluster/Profile 3 includes apps with medium Learning, Usability, Suitability, but low Parental Control and low Security. This profile scheme is an indicative categorization summarizing the crucial features that popular apps possess and can help parents and/or educators' decision-making on choosing the desirable application for their kids. Moreover, from an independent evaluation of these specific fifty apps sought on the internet, the members of Cluster2/Profile 2 were the most popular and preferable, as suggested by the number of downloads. This profile is distinguished for the security dimension."

Therefore, a detailed knowledge of the viroid's incidence and distribution, along with the assessment of unexplored epidemiological factors leading to their occurrence, are necessary to further improve control measures. Herein, a large-scale epidemiological study of citrus viroids in five districts, 38 locations and 145 fields in Greece is presented, based on the analysis of 3005 samples collected from 29 cultivars of six citrus species. We monitored the occurrence of citrus exocortis (CEVd), hop stunt (HSVd), citrus dwarfing (CDVd), citrus bark cracking (CBCVd), and citrus bent leaf (CBLVd) viroids, and addressed their epidemiological patterns and factors shaping their population structure. Our results show a high frequency and wide distribution of four viroids in all areas and in almost all hosts, whereas CBLVd occurrence was restricted to Crete. Mixed infections were found in all districts in which a wide spread of viroids was observed. We identified a potential pathogens' different preferences that could be partially explained by the host and cultivar, including the type of infection (single or mixed) and the number of viroids in the mixed infections.

Therefore, a detailed knowledge of the viroid's incidence and distribution, along with the assessment of unexplored epidemiological factors leading to their occurrence, are necessary to further improve control measures. Herein, a large-scale epidemiological study of citrus viroids in five districts, 38 locations and 145 fields in Greece is presented, based on the analysis of 3005 samples collected from 29 cultivars of six citrus species. We monitored the occurrence of citrus exocortis (CEVd), hop stunt (HSVd), citrus dwarfing (CDVd), citrus bark cracking (CBCVd), and citrus bent leaf (CBLVd) viroids, and addressed their epidemiological patterns and factors shaping their population structure. Our results show a high frequency and wide distribution of four viroids in all areas and in almost all hosts, whereas CBLVd occurrence was restricted to Crete. Mixed infections were found in all districts in which a wide spread of viroids was observed. We identified a potential pathogens' different preferences that could be partially explained by the host and cultivar, including the type of infection (single or mixed) and the number of viroids in the mixed infections. Overall, this work provides the first detailed epidemiological study on citrus viroids, enriching our knowledge for the implementation, production, and distribution of certified citrus propagative material, and the development of sustainable control strategies.

"This study aimed to evaluate the self-reported satisfaction of Spanish postmenopausal women currently treated for vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) symptoms. The CRETA (CRoss sectional European sTudy on Adherence) is a multicenter cross-sectional study conducted in 29 public and private hospitals in Spain, which enrolled postmenopausal women receiving treatment with ospemifene, local hormone therapy (HT) or vaginal moisturizers for VVA. After the prior informed consent of the patients, sociodemographic and treatment perception data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Among 752 women who completed the survey, the satisfaction score was significantly higher for the group treated with ospemifene (mean 8.3 ± 1.4) compared with the local HT group (7.2 ± 1.7) and the vaginal moisturizer group (6.5 ± 2.1) according to a 10-point Likert scale (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Compared to vaginal moisturizers and local HT, participants treated with ospemifene reported the highest adherence (96.7% vs. 70.2% and 78.6%, respectively) and the lowest number of missed doses in the last month (0.6 ± 1.3 standard deviation [SD] vs. 3.5 ± 4.3 SD and 2.0 ± 2.8 SD, respectively) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Ospemifene was significantly perceived as easy to use (83.9% vs. 44.9% and 58.6%, respectively; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), efficacious in reducing the time to relieve symptoms (17.1% vs. 7.0% and 6.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.0005 and <i>p</i> = 0.0006, respectively) and convenient for sexual life (53.1% vs. 25.6% and 42.3%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001 and <i>p</i> = 0.0234, respectively). Among postmenopausal women with VVA, treatment with ospemifene has the most positive perceptions and the highest overall satisfaction level and could be an optimal therapeutic approach, maximizing patient adherence."

"Mediterranean countries experience frequent desert dust storm (DDS) events originating from neighbouring Sahara and Arabian deserts, which are associated with significant increase in mortality and hospital admissions, mostly from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Short-term exposure to ambient air pollution is considered as a trigger for symptomatic exacerbations of pre-existing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and other types of heart arrhythmia. The Mitigating the Health Effects of Desert Dust Storms Using Exposure-Reduction Approaches clinical randomised intervention study in adults with AF is funded by EU LIFE+programme to evaluate the efficacy of recommendations aiming to reduce exposure to desert dust and related heart arrhythmia effects. The study is performed in three heavily exposed to desert dust regions of the Eastern Mediterranean: Cyprus, Israel and Crete-Greece. Adults with paroxysmal AF and implanted pacemaker are recruited and randomised to three parallel groups: (a) no intervention, (b) interventions to reduce outdoor exposure to desert dust, (c) interventions to reduce both outdoor and indoor exposure to particulate matter during desert dust episodes. Eligible participants are enrolled on a web-based platform which communicates, alerts and makes exposure reduction recommendations during DDS events. Exposure changes are assessed by novel tools (smartwatches with Global Positioning System and physical activity sensors, air pollution samplers assessing air quality inside and outside participant's homes, etc). Clinical outcomes include the AF burden expressed as the percentage of time with paroxysmal AF over the total study period, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia episodes as recorded by the participants' pacemakers or cardioverters/defibrillators and the disease-specific Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life questionnaire. Local bioethics' authorities approved the study at all sites, according to national legislations (Cyprus: National Bioethics Committee, Data Protection Commissioner and Ministry of Health; Greece, Scientific Committee and Governing Board of the University General Hospital of Heraklion; Israel: Institutional Review Board ('Helsinki committee') of the Soroka University Medical Center). The findings will be publicised in peer-reviewed scientific journals, in international conferences and in professional websites and newsletters. A summary of the results and participants' interviews will be included in a documentary in English, Greek and Hebrew. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier; NCT03503812."

A fish kill was recorded at the Aposelemis Dam, which is the main reservoir of drinking water for the island of Crete in Greece. Hundreds of goldfish were found dead at a side stream which provides water to the reservoir. The affected fish had been entrapped in a small pond at the side of the stream with practically zero water renewal as the event occurred in August which is a dry season for the island of Crete. The event was alarming for the local community since anthropogenic pollution was initially suspected which could pose a significant human health threat. Following examination of the fish, the mortality was attributed to heavy infection by the parasitic flagellate, Ichthyobodo sp., whilst no pollutants were detected. The parasite was studied through light and scanning electron microscopy and was identified molecularly.

"There is growing evidence that high basal cortisol levels and systemic inflammation independently contribute to cognitive decline among older people without dementia. The present cross-sectional study examined (a) the potential synergistic effect of cortisol levels and systemic inflammation on executive function and (b) whether this effect is more prominent among older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A sub-sample of 99 patients with MCI and 84 older people without cognitive impairment (CNI) (aged 73.8 ± 7.0 years) were recruited from a large population-based cohort in Crete, Greece, and underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological evaluation and a single morning measurement of cortisol and IL-6 plasma levels. Using moderated regression models, we found that the relation between cortisol and executive function in the total sample was moderated by IL-6 levels (<i>b</i> = -0.994, <i>p</i> = 0.044) and diagnostic group separately (<i>b</i> = -0.632, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the interaction between cortisol and IL-6 levels was significant only among persons with MCI (<i>b</i> = -0.562, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The synergistic effect of stress hormones and systemic inflammation on cognitive status appears to be stronger among older people who already display signs of cognitive decline. Targeting hypercortisolemia and inflammation may be a promising strategy toward improving the course of cognitive decline."

"Haematological traits are linked to cardiovascular, metabolic, infectious and immune disorders, as well as cancer. Here, we examine the role of genetic variation in shaping haematological traits in two isolated Mediterranean populations. Using whole-genome sequencing data at 22× depth for 1457 individuals from Crete (MANOLIS) and 1617 from the Pomak villages in Greece, we carry out a genome-wide association scan for haematological traits using linear mixed models. We discover novel associations (p &lt; 5 × 10<sup>-9</sup>) of five rare non-coding variants with alleles conferring effects of 1.44-2.63 units of standard deviation on red and white blood cell count, platelet and red cell distribution width. Moreover, 10.0% of individuals in the Pomak population and 6.8% in MANOLIS carry a pathogenic mutation in the Haemoglobin Subunit Beta (HBB) gene. The mutational spectrum is highly diverse (10 different mutations). The most frequent mutation in MANOLIS is the common Mediterranean variant IVS-I-110 (G&gt;A) (rs35004220). In the Pomak population, c.364C&gt;A (""HbO-Arab"", rs33946267) is most frequent (4.4% allele frequency). We demonstrate effects on haematological and other traits, including bilirubin, cholesterol, and, in MANOLIS, height and gestation age. We find less severe effects on red blood cell traits for HbS, HbO, and IVS-I-6 (T&gt;C) compared to other b+ mutations. Overall, we uncover allelic diversity of HBB in Greek isolated populations and find an important role for additional rare variants outside of HBB."

"To assess the correlation of different vulvovaginal atrophy therapeutic options with the quality of life of postmenopausal women. The CRETA study is a descriptive, observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study designed to measure, besides treatment satisfaction and adherence, the quality of life of postmenopausal women diagnosed with vulvovaginal atrophy in 29 hospitals and centers across Spain. The study enrolled postmenopausal women currently receiving treatment with vaginal moisturizers, local estrogen therapy or ospemifene. Clinical features and treatment perceptions were collected by self-report questionnaire and quality of life was evaluated using the Cervantes scale. Among the 752 women included, the ospemifene cohort showed a statistically significant lower global score (44.9 ± 21.7) on the Cervantes scale (and therefore, a better quality of life) than the cohorts treated with moisturizers (52.5 ± 21.6, p = 0.003) or local estrogen therapy (49.2 ± 23.8, p = 0.0473). In the analysis by domains, ospemifene-treated women showed statistically significant better scores in menopause &amp; health and psychological status than moisturizers-treated women (p &lt; 0.05). In the domains of sexuality and couple relations, the score for the quality of life of the ospemifene cohort was statistically significantly better than the scores in either of the cohorts treated with moisturizers (p &lt; 0.001) or local estrogen therapy (p &lt; 0.05). Postmenopausal women diagnosed with vulvovaginal atrophy and treated with ospemifene have better quality of life than women treated with vaginal moisturizers or local estrogen therapy. The improvement observed with ospemifene is more remarkable in those aspects related to sex life and couple relations. CLINCIALTRIALS. NCT04607707."

The pepper fruit fly <i>Atherigona orientalis</i> (Schiner 1968) (Diptera: Muscidae) is a cosmopolitan tropical pest which has been recently recorded in several European countries. The biology of the pest has been primarily associated not only with decomposing fruits and vegetables, but even vertebrate and invertebrate carrion, dung and faeces. Relatively recently, <i>A. orientalis</i> has been reported as a primary pest of pepper fruits as well. In this short communication, we report, for the first time in Greece and, to the best of our knowledge, in Europe, cases of pepper fruit fly damage to pepper fruits in commercial greenhouse crops (in Crete in 2022). In this direction, possible implications and concerns regarding the occurrence of this pest in Crete are discussed.
PMID:17443965	Binladen J, Gilbert MT, Willerslev E	"Biol Lett. 3(1):55-6; discussion 60-3"	2007	800,000 year old mammoth DNA, modern elephant DNA or PCR artefact?	Poulakakis and colleagues (Poulakakis et al. 2006: Biol. Lett. 2, 451-454), report the recovery of 'authentic' mammoth DNA from an 800,000-year-old fragment of bone excavated on the island of Crete. In light of results from other ancient DNA studies that indicate how DNA survival is unlikely in samples, which are recovered from warm environments and are relatively old (e.g. more than 100,000 years), these findings come as a great surprise. Here, we show that problems exist with the methodological approaches used in the study.

Pigmy elephants inhabited the islands from the Mediterranean region during the Pleistocene period but became extinct in the course of the Holocene. Despite striking distinctive anatomical characteristics related to insularity, some similarities with the lineage of extant Asian elephants have suggested that pigmy elephants could be most probably seen as members of the genus Elephas. Poulakakis et al (2006) have recently challenged this view by recovering a short mtDNA sequence from an 800 000 year old fossil of the Cretan pigmy elephant (Elephas creticus). According to the authors of this study, a deep taxonomic revision of Cretan dwarf elephants would be needed, as the sequence exhibits clear affinities with woolly mammoth haplotypes. However, we point here many aspects that seriously weaken the strength of the ancient DNA evidence reported.

"Wild-growing Greek tulips are protected plants but almost nothing is known about their natural nutrient status and rhizosphere fungal morphotypes in the wild, thus no insight is currently available into their growth and adaptation to their natural environment or artificial settings. To this end, several botanical expeditions were conducted with a special collection permit, and 34 tulip and soil samples were collected, representing 13 species from two phytogeographical regions of Greece (North Aegean Islands, Crete Island) and seven regions of mainland Greece. The tulips' content in essential macro- and micro-nutrients, respective physicochemical soil properties, and rhizosphere fungal morphotypes were assessed across samples, and all parameters were subjected to appropriate statistical analysis to determine their interrelationships. The results showed that soil variables played a significant role in shaping tulips' nutrient content, explaining up to 67% of the detected variability as in the case of phosphorus (P) in the above-ground plant tissue. In addition, significant correlations were observed (with an <i>r</i> value of up to 0.65, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001) between essential nutrients in the tulips, such as calcium (Ca) and boron (B). The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that between the three spatial units examined, the total variability of tulips' nutrient content produced a clear distinction among sampled species, while the first two PCA axes managed to explain 44.3% of it. This was further confirmed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) results which showed corresponding significant differences (at <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in both the tulips' nutrient content and the studied soil properties as well (mean values of N, P, and K in the North Aegean Islands tulips' nutrient content, up to 53%, 119%, and 54% higher compared to those of the Crete Island, respectively). Our study sheds light on Greek tulips' adaptability and resilience in their original habitats, facilitating at the same time the undertaken efforts regarding their conservation and potential domestication in artificial settings."

Poulakakis and colleagues (Poulakakis et al. 2006: Biol. Lett. 2, 451-454), report the recovery of 'authentic' mammoth DNA from an 800,000-year-old fragment of bone excavated on the island of Crete. In light of results from other ancient DNA studies that indicate how DNA survival is unlikely in samples, which are recovered from warm environments and are relatively old (e.g. more than 100,000 years), these findings come as a great surprise. Here, we show that problems exist with the methodological approaches used in the study. First, the nested PCR technique as reported is nonsensical--one of the second round 'nested' primers falls outside the amplicon of the first round PCR.

The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), holds an impressive record of successful invasion events promoted by globalization in fruit trade and human mobility. In addition, C. capitata is gradually expanding its geographic distribution to cooler temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Cold tolerance of C. capitata seems to be a crucial feature that promotes population establishment and hence invasion success. To elucidate the interplay between the invasion process in the northern hemisphere and cold tolerance of geographically isolated populations of C. capitata, we determined (a) the response to acute cold stress survival of adults, and (b) the supercooling capacity (SCP) of immature stages and adults. To assess the phenotypic plasticity in these populations, the effect of acclimation to low temperatures on acute cold stress survival in adults was also examined. The results revealed that survival after acute cold stress was positively related to low temperature acclimation, except for females originating from Thessaloniki (northern Greece). Adults from the warmer environment of South Arava (Israel) were less tolerant after acute cold stress compared with those from Heraklion (Crete, Greece) and Thessaloniki. Plastic responses to cold acclimation were population specific, with the South Arava population being more plastic compared to the two Greek populations. For SCP, the results revealed that there is little to no correlation between SCP and climate variables of the areas where C. capitata populations originated. SCP was much lower than the lowest temperature individuals are likely to experience in their respective habitats. These results set the stage for asking questions regarding the evolutionary adaptive processes that facilitate range expansions of C. capitata into cooler temperate areas of Europe.

"Transvaginal ultrasound imaging has become an essential tool in the prenatal evaluation of the lower uterine segment and anatomy of the cervix but there are only limited data on the role of transvaginal ultrasound in the management of patients at high risk of placenta accreta spectrum at birth. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of transvaginal sonography in the third trimester in predicting outcomes in patients with a high probability of placenta accreta spectrum at birth. This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients presenting with a singleton pregnancy, a history of at least one prior cesarean delivery and diagnosed prenatally with an anterior low-lying/placenta previa delivered electively after 32 weeks. All patients had a least one detailed ultrasound examination including transabdominal and transvaginal scans within two weeks prior to delivery. Two experienced operators, blinded to the clinical data were asked to make a judgement on the likelihood of placenta accreta spectrum as a binary: low or high-probability of placenta accreta spectrum and to predict the main surgical outcome (conservative vs peripartum hysterectomy). The diagnosis of accreta placentation was confirmed when one or more placental cotyledon(s) could not be digitally separated from the uterine wall at delivery or during the gross examination of the hysterectomy or partial myometrial resection specimens. A total of 111 patients were included in the study. Abnormal placental tissue attachment was found in 76 (68.5%) patients at birth and histologic examination confirmed superficial villous attachment (creta) and deep villous attachment (increta) in 11 and 65 cases, respectively. Seventy-two (64.9%) patients had a peripartum hysterectomy including 13 cases with no evidence of PAS at birth due to failure to reconstruct the lower uterine segment and/or excessive bleeding. There was a significant difference in the distribution of placental location (X2 = 12.66; p= 0.002) between transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound examination but both ultrasound techniques had similar likelihood score in identifying accreta placentation that was confirmed at birth. On transabdominal scan, only a high lacuna score was significantly associated (p= 0.02) with an increased chance of hysterectomy whereas on transvaginal scan significant associations were found between the need for hysterectomy and the thickness of the distal part of the lower uterine segment (p= 0.003), changes in the cervix structure (p= 0.01), cervix increased vascularity (p= 0.001), and the presence of placental lacunae (p= 0.005). The odds ratio for peripartum hysterectomy were 5.01 (95%CI 1.25;20.1) for a very thin (&lt; 1mm) distal lower uterine segment and 5.62 (95%CI 1.41;22.5) 3+ lacuna score. Transvaginal ultrasound examination contribute to both prenatal management and to prediction of surgical outcomes in patients with a history of prior CD with and without ultrasound signs suggestive of PAS. Transvaginal ultrasound examination of the lower uterine segment and cervix should be included in clinical protocols for the preoperative evaluation of patients at risk of complex cesarean delivery, with or without signs suggesting PAS on imaging."

Greece exhibits the highest seismic activity in Europe, manifested in intense seismicity with large magnitude events and frequent earthquake swarms. In the present work, we analyzed the spatiotemporal properties of recent earthquake swarms that occurred in the broader area of Greece using the Non-Extensive Statistical Physics (NESP) framework, which appears suitable for studying complex systems. The behavior of complex systems, where multifractality and strong correlations among the elements of the system exist, as in tectonic and volcanic environments, can adequately be described by Tsallis entropy (<i>S<sub>q</sub></i>), introducing the <i>Q</i>-exponential function and the entropic parameter <i>q</i> that expresses the degree of non-additivity of the system. Herein, we focus the analysis on the 2007 Trichonis Lake, the 2016 Western Crete, the 2021-2022 Nisyros, the 2021-2022 Thiva and the 2022 Pagasetic Gulf earthquake swarms. Using the seismicity catalogs for each swarm, we investigate the inter-event time (<i>T</i>) and distance (<i>D</i>) distributions with the <i>Q</i>-exponential function, providing the <i>q<sub>T</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>D</sub></i> entropic parameters. The results show that <i>q<sub>T</sub></i> varies from 1.44 to 1.58, whereas <i>q<sub>D</sub></i> ranges from 0.46 to 0.75 for the inter-event time and distance distributions, respectively. Furthermore, we describe the frequency-magnitude distributions with the Gutenberg-Richter scaling relation and the fragment-asperity model of earthquake interactions derived within the NESP framework. The results of the analysis indicate that the statistical properties of earthquake swarms can be successfully reproduced by means of NESP and confirm the complexity and non-additivity of the spatiotemporal evolution of seismicity. Finally, the superstatistics approach, which is closely connected to NESP and is based on a superposition of ordinary local equilibrium statistical mechanics, is further used to discuss the temporal patterns of the earthquake evolution during the swarms.

Rapid and accurate diagnostics of patients with suspected seasonal influenza or pathogens of the upper respiratory tract is crucial. Fast detection is important especially for influenza A/B virus, so that isolation measures should be taken to prevent the spread of the virus. We compared the performance of two syndromic testing methodologies (QIAstat-Dx RP, BioFire RP2plus) against the Alere™ i as the comparator method. Totally, 97 swab samples were included from patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection admitted in the hospitals of the wider region of Crete, Greece. The Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) of the BioFire RP2plus was 100% (95% CI 87.66%-100%), while the Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was estimated at 91.3% (95% CI 82.03%-96.74%). This method produced no invalid results. For QIAstat-Dx RP the PPA was 89.29% (95% CI 71.77%-97.73%), while the NPA was 91.3% (95% CI 82.03%-96.74%, 63/69). The BioFire RP2plus managed to determine the subtype in more samples than the QIAstat-Dx RP. Both panels can be valuable tools for clinicians, since they both display high sensitivity and specificity. We report a slightly better performance for BioFire RP2plus, since it produced no invalid results.

Boiss. roots. 	<i>Ferulago nodosa</i> (L.) Boiss. (Apiaceae) is a species occurring in the Balkan-Tyrrhenian area being present in Crete, Greece, Albania, and probably in Macedonia. From the roots of this accession of species, not previously investigated, four coumarins, grandivittin, aegelinol benzoate, felamidin and aegelinol, and two terpenoids, (2<i>E</i>)-3-methyl-4-[(3-methyl-1-oxo-2-buten-1yl)oxy]-2-butenoic acid and pressafonin-A, were isolated and spectroscopically characterized. The last one was never detected in <i>Ferulago</i> species. The evaluation of the anti-tumor effects of <i>F. nodosa</i> coumarins on colon cancer HCT116 cells showed only a modest effect on reduction of tumor cell viability. For aegelinol, the reduction of colon cancer cell viability already appears with 25 <i>µ</i>Μ, while using 50 e 100 <i>µ</i>M doses of marmesin the residual viability amounted to 70% and 54%, respectively. This effect resulted more evident at higher doses of compounds (at 200 µM from 80% to 0%). The most effective compounds resulted coumarins lacking ester group.

The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), holds an impressive record of successful invasion events promoted by globalization in fruit trade and human mobility. In addition, C. capitata is gradually expanding its geographic distribution to cooler temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Cold tolerance of C. capitata seems to be a crucial feature that promotes population establishment and hence invasion success. To elucidate the interplay between the invasion process in the northern hemisphere and cold tolerance of geographically isolated populations of C. capitata, we determined (a) the response to acute cold stress survival of adults, and (b) the supercooling capacity (SCP) of immature stages and adults. To assess the phenotypic plasticity in these populations, the effect of acclimation to low temperatures on acute cold stress survival in adults was also examined. The results revealed that survival after acute cold stress was positively related to low temperature acclimation, except for females originating from Thessaloniki (northern Greece). Adults from the warmer environment of South Arava (Israel) were less tolerant after acute cold stress compared with those from Heraklion (Crete, Greece) and Thessaloniki. Plastic responses to cold acclimation were population specific, with the South Arava population being more plastic compared to the two Greek populations. For SCP, the results revealed that there is little to no correlation between SCP and climate variables of the areas where C. capitata populations originated. SCP was much lower than the lowest temperature individuals are likely to experience in their respective habitats. These results set the stage for asking questions regarding the evolutionary adaptive processes that facilitate range expansions of C. capitata into cooler temperate areas of Europe.

PMID:37187303	Jauniaux E, Hussein AM, Thabet MM, Elbarmelgy RM, Elbarmelgy RA, Jurkovic D	Am J Obstet Gynecol.	2023	The role of transvaginal ultrasound in the third-trimester evaluation of patients at high risk of placenta accreta spectrum at birth. 	"Transvaginal ultrasound imaging has become an essential tool in the prenatal evaluation of the lower uterine segment and anatomy of the cervix, but there are only limited data on the role of transvaginal ultrasound in the management of patients at high risk of placenta accreta spectrum at birth. This study aimed to evaluate the role of transvaginal sonography in the third trimester of pregnancy in predicting outcomes in patients with a high probability of placenta accreta spectrum at birth. This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients presenting with a singleton pregnancy and a history of at least 1 previous cesarean delivery and patients diagnosed prenatally with an anterior low-lying placenta or placenta previa delivered electively after 32 weeks of gestation. All patients had a least 1 detailed ultrasound examination, including transabdominal and transvaginal scans, within 2 weeks before delivery. Of note, 2 experienced operators, blinded to the clinical data, were asked to make a judgment on the likelihood of placenta accreta spectrum as a binary, low or high-probability of placenta accreta spectrum, and to predict the main surgical outcome (conservative vs peripartum hysterectomy). The diagnosis of accreta placentation was confirmed when one or more placental cotyledons could not be digitally separated from the uterine wall at delivery or during the gross examination of the hysterectomy or partial myometrial resection specimens. A total of 111 patients were included in the study. Abnormal placental tissue attachment was found in 76 patients (68.5%) at birth, and histologic examination confirmed superficial villous attachment (creta) and deep villous attachment (increta) in 11 and 65 cases, respectively. Of note, 72 patients (64.9%) had a peripartum hysterectomy, including 13 cases with no evidence of placenta accreta spectrum at birth because of failure to reconstruct the lower uterine segment and/or excessive bleeding. There was a significant difference in the distribution of placental location (X<sup>2</sup>=12.66; P=.002) between transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound examinations, but both ultrasound techniques had similar likelihood scores in identifying accreta placentation that was confirmed at birth. On transabdominal scan, only a high lacuna score was significantly associated (P=.02) with an increased chance of hysterectomy, whereas on transvaginal scan, significant associations were found between the need for hysterectomy and the thickness of the distal part of the lower uterine segment (P=.003), changes in the cervix structure (P=.01), cervix increased vascularity (P=.001), and the presence of placental lacunae (P=.005). The odds ratio for peripartum hysterectomy were 5.01 (95% confidence interval, 1.25-20.1) for a very thin (&lt;1-mm) distal lower uterine segment and 5.62 (95% confidence interval, 1.41-22.5) for a lacuna score of 3+. Transvaginal ultrasound examination contributes to both prenatal management and the prediction of surgical outcomes in patients with a history of previous cesarean delivery with and without ultrasound signs suggestive of placenta accreta spectrum. Transvaginal ultrasound examination of the lower uterine segment and cervix should be included in clinical protocols for the preoperative evaluation of patients at risk of complex cesarean delivery."

To examine the relative validity of an FFQ based on parental report for pre-school children in the mother-child 'Rhea' birth cohort. The children's mothers completed an FFQ that referred to the children's dietary intake for the previous year by telephone interview. Mothers completed also three food records, two on weekdays and one on a weekend day. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for the energy-adjusted values. Weighted kappa statistics (κ(w)) and the Bland-Altman technique were used to test the degree of agreement between the two dietary methods. Heraklion, Crete, Greece, 2011-2012. A total of ninety-nine mothers (corresponding to fifty-one boys and forty-eight girls) participated in the validation study. The mean and median values of all food group and nutrient intakes did not differ significantly between the two dietary methods. Overall, fair agreement was observed between the FFQ and the food records for ranking participants based on their intake, with κ(w) ranging from 0·21 to 0·40 for most foods and nutrients. On average, 88 % of participants were classified into the same or adjacent tertiles for nutrient and food group intakes by both dietary methods. The degree of agreement was also confirmed by the visual examination of the Bland-Altman plots. The study indicates that the Rhea 4 years FFQ is a relatively accurate tool for assessing habitual food group and nutrient intakes among pre-school children in Crete, Greece.

This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from a prospective mother-child cohort (Rhea Study). Participants completed a social capital questionnaire and an FFQ in mid-pregnancy. Mediterranean diet adherence was evaluated through an a priori score ranging from 0 to 8 (minimal-maximal adherence). Maternal social capital scores were categorized into three groups: the upper 10 % was the high social capital group, the middle 80 % was the medium and the lowest 10 % was the low social capital group. Multivariable log-binomial and linear regression models adjusted for confounders were performed. Heraklion, Crete, Greece. A total of 377 women with singleton pregnancies. High maternal Total Social Capital was associated with an increase of almost 1 point in Mediterranean diet score (highest v. lowest group: β coefficient=0·95, 95 % CI 0·23, 1·68), after adjustment for confounders. Similar dose-response effects were noted for the scale Tolerance of Diversity (highest v. lowest group: adjusted β coefficient=1·08, 95 % CI 0·39, 1·77). Individual social capital and tolerance of diversity are associated with adherence to the Mediterranean diet in pregnancy. Women with higher social capital may exhibit a higher sense of obligation to themselves and to others that may lead to proactive nutrition-related activities. Less tolerant women may not provide the opportunity to new healthier, but unfamiliar, nutritional recommendations to become part of their regular diet.

Comparison with a 1965 representative Cretan sample and 2000 SCS survivors indicated an increased concentration of oleic acid (known for its protective role against mortality) and a decreased concentration of PUFA (known for their susceptibility to oxidation) in our surviving sample at 2010. These changes may reflect internal physiological processes due to diet change within these years and/or ageing."

Of the population, 82·7 % were overweight or obese with a significantly different prevalence between overweight men and women (43·4 v. 34·7 %, P=0·002). The majority (70·6 %) of participants were married, while a larger proportion of women were widowed than men (27·8 v. 3·5 %, P&lt;0·001). Smoking was more prevalent in men (38·7 v. 8·2 %, P&lt;0·001), as 88·8% of women had never smoked. Four dietary patterns emerged as characteristic of the population; these were termed 'local', 'high fat and sugar, 'Greek café/tavern' and 'olive oil, fruits and vegetables'. Individuals more adherent to the local dietary pattern presented higher blood glucose (β=4·026, P&lt;0·001). Similarly, individuals with higher compliance with the Greek café/tavern pattern had higher waist-to-hip ratio (β=0·012, P&lt;0·001), blood pressure (β=1·015, P=0·005) and cholesterol (β=5·398, P&lt;0·001). Profiling of the MANOLIS elderly population identifies unique unhealthy dietary patterns that are associated with cardiometabolic indices."

The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), holds an impressive record of successful invasion events promoted by globalization in fruit trade and human mobility. In addition, C. capitata is gradually expanding its geographic distribution to cooler temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Cold tolerance of C. capitata seems to be a crucial feature that promotes population establishment and hence invasion success. To elucidate the interplay between the invasion process in the northern hemisphere and cold tolerance of geographically isolated populations of C. capitata, we determined (a) the response to acute cold stress survival of adults, and (b) the supercooling capacity (SCP) of immature stages and adults. To assess the phenotypic plasticity in these populations, the effect of acclimation to low temperatures on acute cold stress survival in adults was also examined. The results revealed that survival after acute cold stress was positively related to low temperature acclimation, except for females originating from Thessaloniki (northern Greece). Adults from the warmer environment of South Arava (Israel) were less tolerant after acute cold stress compared with those from Heraklion (Crete, Greece) and Thessaloniki. Plastic responses to cold acclimation were population specific, with the South Arava population being more plastic compared to the two Greek populations. For SCP, the results revealed that there is little to no correlation between SCP and climate variables of the areas where C. capitata populations originated. SCP was much lower than the lowest temperature individuals are likely to experience in their respective habitats. These results set the stage for asking questions regarding the evolutionary adaptive processes that facilitate range expansions of C. capitata into cooler temperate areas of Europe.

Rapid and accurate diagnostics of patients with suspected seasonal influenza or pathogens of the upper respiratory tract is crucial. Fast detection is important especially for influenza A/B virus, so that isolation measures should be taken to prevent the spread of the virus. We compared the performance of two syndromic testing methodologies (QIAstat-Dx RP, BioFire RP2plus) against the Alere™ i as the comparator method. Totally, 97 swab samples were included from patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection admitted in the hospitals of the wider region of Crete, Greece. The Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) of the BioFire RP2plus was 100% (95% CI 87.66%-100%), while the Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was estimated at 91.3% (95% CI 82.03%-96.74%). This method produced no invalid results. For QIAstat-Dx RP the PPA was 89.29% (95% CI 71.77%-97.73%), while the NPA was 91.3% (95% CI 82.03%-96.74%, 63/69). The BioFire RP2plus managed to determine the subtype in more samples than the QIAstat-Dx RP. Both panels can be valuable tools for clinicians, since they both display high sensitivity and specificity. We report a slightly better performance for BioFire RP2plus, since it produced no invalid results.

Maritime transport is a vital sector for global trade and the world economy. Particularly for islands, there is also an important social dimension of this sector, since island communities strongly rely on it for a connection with the mainland and the transportation of goods and passengers. Furthermore, islands are exceptionally vulnerable to climate change, as the rising sea level and extreme events are expected to induce severe impacts. Such hazards are anticipated to also affect the operations of the maritime transport sector by affecting either the port infrastructure or ships en route. The present study is an effort to better comprehend and assess the future risk of maritime transport disruption in six European islands and archipelagos, and it aims at supporting regional to local policy and decision-making. We employ state-of-the-art regional climate datasets and the widely used impact chain approach to identify the different components that might drive such risks. Larger islands (e.g., Corsica, Cyprus and Crete) are found to be more resilient to the impacts of climate change on maritime operations. Our findings also highlight the importance of adopting a low-emission pathway, since this will keep the risk of maritime transport disruption similar to present levels or even slightly decreased for some islands because of an enhanced adaptation capacity and advantageous demographic changes.

"	Currently, the use of medicinal plants has increased. <i>Artemisia</i> species have been used in several applications, including medicinal use and uses in cosmetics, foods and beverages. <i>Artemisia arborescens</i> L. and <i>Artemisia inculta</i> are part of the Mediterranean diet in the form of aqueous infusions. Herein, we aimed to compare the secondary metabolites of the decoctions and two different extracts (methanolic and aqueous-glycerolic) of these two species, as well as their antioxidant capacity and trace metal levels. Total phenolic, total flavonoid, total terpenes, total hydroxycinnamate, total flavonol, total anthocyanin contents and antioxidant/antiradical activity were determined, and GC/MS analysis was applied to identify and quantify phenolics and terpenoids. Trace metals were quantified with ICP-MS. Aqueous-glycerolic extracts demonstrated higher levels of total secondary metabolites, greater antioxidant potential and higher terpenoid levels than decoctions and methanolic extracts. Subsequently, the aqueous-glycerolic extract of a particularly high phenolic content was further analyzed applying targeted LC-MS/MS as the most appropriate analytic tool for the determination of the phenolic profile. Overall, twenty-two metabolites were identified. The potential contribution of infusions consumption to metal intake was additionally evaluated, and did not exceed the recommended daily intake. Our results support the use of these two species in several food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical applications.

"To estimate the prevalence and burden of medication overuse headache in a representative sample of the Greek population, aged 18-70 years old. This is a cross-sectional descriptive observational study performed by quantitative computer-assisted telephone interviews, using a standardized 37-item questionnaire for headaches. The prevalence of medication overuse headache was estimated in the general population and compared within the groups formed by factors such as age, gender, diagnosis of headache type, prophylactic treatment used, geographical regions, social class, workdays lost and loss of productivity. 1197 (12.0%) participants reported headaches affecting performance out of 10,008 interviewees. The estimated prevalence of medication overuse headache in the general population was 0.7% (95% CI: 0.5-0.9). The female to male ratio was 3.6:1. The proportion of medication overuse headache was largest in the 35-54 age group, followed by the over 55 group. The Aegean islands and Crete were the regions with the highest proportion of medication overuse headache. Among participants with headaches, the proportion of medication overuse headache was 5.8% (95% CI: 4.4%-7.1%); 6.3% (95% CI: 4.7%-7.9%) among females and 4.4% (95% CI: 2.2%-6.6%) among males. In the same headache group, the proportion of medication overuse headache by prophylactic treatment for headache was 19.0% (95% CI: 9.5%-29.1%) for recipients and 5.0% (95% CI: 3.8-6.3) for non-recipients. The mean absenteeism in people with medication overuse headache was 1.0 days/month (95% CI: 0.4-1.6) and the mean presenteeism 6.3 days/month (95% CI: 3.9-8.7). The social class stratification showed a significant effect between the medication overuse headache in the sample of the general population and the C2 class, corresponding to skilled manual labour (OR: 0.7, CI: 0.5-0.9). In people with chronic migraine, and chronic tension type headache, as differentiated by the 37-item questionnaire, the proportion of medication overuse headache in the headache group estimated to be 50.5% (95% CI: 40.8%-60.1%) and 45.9%, (95% CI: 29.9%-62.0%) respectively. The group of people with acute headache medication overuse fulfilling the rest of the diagnostic criteria for medication overuse headache, except from the number of headache days per month (≥15 days/month), had a prevalence of 2.0% (95% CI: 1.75-2.30) and a proportion of 17.0% (95% CI: 14.8%-19.1%) among people with headache. In the episodic types of headache, the proportion of acute headache medication overuse was higher in the subgroup of people with high frequency episodic migraine, 24.9% (95% CI: 18.8%-31.0%), while it was 10.8% (95% CI: 8.2%-13.5%), for the low frequency episodic migraine and 8.5% (95% CI: 5.5%-10.4%), for the episodic tension type headache. The prevalence of medication overuse headache in the general population in Greece and its proportion among the people with headache belongs to the lower part of the range of the reported literature, while the 3.6:1 female to male ratio is in agreement with it.

The potential benefits of LUS utilization. 	"In Primary Health Care (PHC) many interstitial lung disease (ILD) cases may remain at diagnostic delay, due to their challenging presentation and the limited experience of general practitioners (GPs) in recognizing their early symptoms. We have designed a feasibility study to investigate early ILD case-finding competency between PHC and tertiary care. A cross-sectional prospective case-finding study was launched at two private health care centers of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, during nine months (2021-2022). After clinical assessment by GP, PHC attenders, who agreed to participate in the study, were referred to the Respiratory Medicine Department, University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, underwent Lung Ultrasound (LUS) and those with an overall suspicion for ILDs underwent high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used. Multiple Poisson regression analysis was performed to explain positive LUS and HRCT decision with selected variables. One hundred and nine patients out of 183 were finally included (54.1% females; mean age 61, SD: 8.3 years). Thirty-five (32.1%) were current smokers. Overall, two out of ten cases were assessed to need HRCT due to a moderate or high suspicion (19.3%; 95%CI 12.7, 27.4). However, in those who had dyspnea in relation to counterparts, a significantly higher percentage of patients with LUS findings (57.9% vs. 34.0%, p=0.013) was found, as in those who had crackles (100.0% vs. 44.2%, p= 0.005). Detected possible ILD provisional labelling cases were 6, and most importantly, 5 of those cases were considered highly suspicious for further evaluation based on LUS findings. This is a feasibility study exploring potentials by combining data of medical history, basic auscultation skills, as crackles detection, and inexpensive and radiation-free imaging technique, such as LUS. Cases of ILD labeling may be hidden within PHC, sometimes, much before any clinical manifestation."

"Identifying modifiable factors that may predict long-term cognitive decline in the elderly with adequate daily functionality is critical. Such factors may include poor sleep quality and quantity, sleep-related breathing disorders, inflammatory cytokines and stress hormones, as well as mental health problems. This work reports the methodology and descriptive characteristics of a long-term, multidisciplinary study on modifiable risk factors for cognitive status progression, focusing on the 7-year follow-up. Participants were recruited from a large community-dwelling cohort residing in Crete, Greece (CAC; Cretan Aging Cohort). Baseline assessments were conducted in 2013-2014 (Phase I and II, circa 6-month time interval) and follow-up in 2020-2022 (Phase III). In total, 151 individuals completed the Phase III evaluation. Of those, 71 were cognitively non-impaired (CNI group) in Phase II and 80 had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In addition to sociodemographic, lifestyle, medical, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric data, objective sleep was assessed based on actigraphy (Phase II and III) and home polysomnography (Phase III), while inflammation markers and stress hormones were measured in both phases. Despite the homogeneity of the sample in most sociodemographic indices, MCI persons were significantly older (mean age = 75.03 years, SD = 6.34) and genetically predisposed for cognitive deterioration (APOE ε4 allele carriership). Also, at follow-up, we detected a significant increase in self-reported anxiety symptoms along with a substantial rise in psychotropic medication use and incidence of major medical morbidities. The longitudinal design of the CAC study may provide significant data on possible modifiable factors in the course of cognitive progression in the community-dwelling elderly."

Wetlands are of great importance for providing the appropriate conditions for the diversity of species and inhabitants living in these ecosystems and for a wide range of public goods and services (fresh water, air filtering, recreational and tourism opportunities). However, despite their importance, wetlands are continuously degraded due to various human activities at an alarming rate worldwide. In the context of this study and considering the rational management of wetlands and the inevitable impact of climate change, a wetland, spatiotemporal monitoring system is proposed, implemented in the karst wetland of Almyros Stream (Heraklion, Crete, Greece). The implementation of this system is based on robust techniques from the allied fields of chemistry, earth and ecology assisted by GIS techniques. Our results indicate that this Mediterranean karst wetland of great ecological importance is under pressure because of pollution, climate change and land change. This argument is supported by (a) the high concentrations of water photosynthetic pigments and nutrients at certain times of the year, both provided by chemical analysis and partially verified by geophysical monitoring (spectral induced polarization) and (b) the high values of soil magnetic susceptibility at sites close to human infrastructures that is an indicator of heavy metals concentrations.

Nocardiosis is a rare disease affecting both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts, presented in various clinical forms ranging from localized to disseminated infection. Aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of nocardiosis, antimicrobial resistance profiles, treatment, and outcomes of Nocardia infection over the last 5 years at our institution. The medical records and microbiological data of patients affected by nocardiosis and treated at the university hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, between 2018 and 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. The isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and through sequencing of 16S rRNA. Antimicrobial susceptibility for 17 agents was determined by E-test and results were interpreted according to CLSI guidelines. Among the 28 Nocardia isolates, eight species were identified, with Nocardia brasiliensis being the most prevalent (32.1%), followed by Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (25%), and Nocardia farcinica (14.3%). Skin and soft tissue infections were the most common presentations, noted in 13 (50%) patients, followed by pulmonary infection presented in 10 (38.5%) patients. Fifteen patients (57.7%) had at least one underlying disease, and 11 (42.3%) were on immunosuppressive or long-term corticosteroid treatment. Susceptibility rates of linezolid, tigecycline, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, moxifloxacin, and imipenem were 100, 100, 96.4, 92.9, 82.1, and 42.9%, respectively. The 26 patients in this study were treated with various antibiotics. Mortality rate was 3.8%, and the patient who died had disseminated infection. Since epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility are evolving, continuous surveillance is mandatory in order to initiate appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

The EFSA Panel on Plant Health conducted a pest categorisation of the avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd) for the EU. The identity of ASBVd, a member of the genus <i>Avsunviroid</i> (family <i>Avsunviroidae</i>) is clearly defined and detection and identification methods are available. The pathogen is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. ASBVd has been reported in Australia, Ghana, Guatemala, Israel, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, USA (California, Florida) and Venezuela. In the EU, it has been reported in Greece (Crete Island) and Spain. The pathogen could establish in the EU wherever avocado (<i>Persea americana</i>) is grown. The only known natural host of ASBVd is avocado to which it causes the severe 'avocado sunblotch' disease, characterised by white, yellow, red or necrotic depressed areas or scars on the fruit surface, bleached veins and petioles of the leaf, and rectangular cracking patterns in the bark of the old branches. Fruit yield and quality are severely diminished. ASBVd infects under experimental conditions a few more species in the family Lauraceae. The viroid is naturally transmitted at an extremely high rate by seeds (up to 100% in asymptomatically infected trees), but with a low efficiency by pollen (only to the produced seeds), and possibly through root grafts. Plants for planting, including seeds, and fresh avocado fruits were identified as the most relevant pathways for further entry of ASBVd into the EU. Avocado crops are cultivated in southern EU countries. Should the pest further enter and establish in the EU, impact on the production of avocado is expected. Phytosanitary measures are available to prevent entry and spread of the viroid in the EU. ASBVd fulfils the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.

(1) Background: The essential oils (EOs) of <i>Sideritis</i> L. have attracted great interest due to their pharmacological activities and potential applications in the cosmetic and perfume industries. The aim of this work was to study the EO chemical composition of three of the most popular, in Greece, mountain tea species: namely, these include <i>Sideritis scardica</i>, <i>Sideritis raeseri</i>, and <i>Sideritis syriaca</i>. (2) Methods: The EOs were obtained from the aerial parts of three <i>Sideritis</i> species that were cultivated in various regions of Greece by hydrodistillation, and the chemical composition was studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. (3) Results: The EOs of the <i>Sideritis</i> species-<i>S. scardica</i> (SSC1, SSC2, SSC3), <i>S. raeseri</i> (SR1, SR2, SR3), and <i>S. syriaca</i> (SS1, SS2, SS3)-were analyzed by GC-MS, and they showed both qualitatively and quantitatively high variation in their chemical composition. (4) Conclusions: The EOs of <i>S. scardica</i> and <i>S. raeseri</i> from three different regions of Greece, and the <i>S. syriaca</i> from three different localities of Crete Island in Southern Greece, showed high chemical variability. Although 165 different components were found to be present in the nine samples through GC-MS analysis, only 7 (1-octen-3-ol, linalool, <i>trans</i>-pinocarveol, <i>p</i>-mentha-1,5-dien-8-ol, <i>α</i>-terpineol, myrtenol, and verbenone) were common components in the nine EOs, which were identified to be highly variable in different percentages among the samples. Even the EOs of SS1 and SS2, which were cultivated nearby, showed different GC profiles. The composition variation observed might be attributed to differentiations in the soil and climatic conditions.
PMID:37513360	Ralli E, Spyros A	Molecules. 28(14)	2023	A Study of Greek Graviera Cheese by NMR-Based Metabolomics. 	Graviera is a very popular yellow hard cheese produced in mainland Greece and the Aegean islands, and in three PDO (protected denomination of origin) locations. Apart from geographic location, type of milk and production practices are also factors that affect cheese composition, and make this dairy product unique in taste and aroma. In this work, <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in combination with chemometrics has been used to determine the metabolite profile (40 compounds) of graviera cheese produced in different geographic locations, with emphasis on cheeses produced on the island of Crete. Organic acids and amino acids were the main components quantified in the polar cheese fraction, while the fatty acid (FA) composition of the lipid fraction was also obtained. Analysis of variance (Anova) of the dataset showed that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) and linoleic acid differentiate gravieras produced in different areas of Crete, and that the total amino acid content was higher in cheeses produced in eastern Crete. Targeted discriminant analysis models classified gravieras produced in mainland Greece, Cyclades and Crete based on differences in 1,2-diglycerides, sterols, GABA and FA composition. Targeted and untargeted orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models were capable of differentiating gravieras produced in the island of Crete and hold promise as the basis for the authentication of PDO graviera products.

The current study reports an ethnobotanical field investigation of traditionally gathered and consumed wild greens (<i>Chorta</i>) in one of the five so-called Blue Zones in the world: Ikaria Isle, Greece. Through 31 semi-structured interviews, a total of 56 wild green plants were documented along with their culinary uses, linguistic labels, and locally perceived tastes. Most of the gathered greens were described as bitter and associated with members of Asteraceae and Brassicaceae botanical families (31%), while among the top-quoted wild greens, species belonging to these two plant families accounted for 50% of the wild vegetables, which were consumed mostly cooked. Cross-cultural comparison with foraging in other areas of the central-eastern Mediterranean and the Near East demonstrated a remarkable overlapping of Ikarian greens with Cretan and Sicilian, as well as in the prevalence of bitter-tasting botanical genera. Important differences with other wild greens-related food heritage were found, most notably with the Armenian and Kurdish ones, which do not commonly feature many bitter greens. The proven role of extra-oral bitter taste receptors in the modulation of gastric emptying, glucose absorption and crosstalk with microbiota opens new ways of looking at these differences, in particular with regard to possible health implications. The present study is also an important attempt to preserve and document the bio-cultural gastronomic heritage of <i>Chorta</i> as a quintessential part of the Mediterranean diet. The study recommends that nutritionists, food scientists, and historians, as well as policymakers and practitioners, pay the required attention to traditional rural dietary systems as models of sustainable health.

Friesea cretensis sp. nov. can be easily identified by 5 + 5 ocelli, 4 anal spines and 6 microchaetae in furcal field. Characteristic and recognizable character of Pseudachorutella ellisi sp. nov. is very long buccal cone. Deutonura schulzi sp. nov. differs from other taxa in the genus in the presence of internal tooth on claw. Endonura zelkovae sp. nov. is especially distinctive due to the presence 3+s and 4+s chaetae De on Th. II and III. The main characteristics of Cryptonura ellisi sp. nov. include a massive mandibles and high number of mandibular teeth.

A new species of fungus moths (Tineidae), Neurothaumasia cretica sp. nov., is described from specimens collected on Crete isl. (Greece). It differs from congeneric taxa by the characteristic black and white forewing pattern which is only shared with N. fasciata Petersen, 1959 from the Middle East, and the widespread western Palaearctic N. ankerella (Mann, 1867).

The current study reports an ethnobotanical field investigation of traditionally gathered and consumed wild greens (<i>Chorta</i>) in one of the five so-called Blue Zones in the world: Ikaria Isle, Greece. Through 31 semi-structured interviews, a total of 56 wild green plants were documented along with their culinary uses, linguistic labels, and locally perceived tastes. Most of the gathered greens were described as bitter and associated with members of Asteraceae and Brassicaceae botanical families (31%), while among the top-quoted wild greens, species belonging to these two plant families accounted for 50% of the wild vegetables, which were consumed mostly cooked. Cross-cultural comparison with foraging in other areas of the central-eastern Mediterranean and the Near East demonstrated a remarkable overlapping of Ikarian greens with Cretan and Sicilian, as well as in the prevalence of bitter-tasting botanical genera. Important differences with other wild greens-related food heritage were found, most notably with the Armenian and Kurdish ones, which do not commonly feature many bitter greens. The proven role of extra-oral bitter taste receptors in the modulation of gastric emptying, glucose absorption and crosstalk with microbiota opens new ways of looking at these differences, in particular with regard to possible health implications. The present study is also an important attempt to preserve and document the bio-cultural gastronomic heritage of <i>Chorta</i> as a quintessential part of the Mediterranean diet. The study recommends that nutritionists, food scientists, and historians, as well as policymakers and practitioners, pay the required attention to traditional rural dietary systems as models of sustainable health.

"In May 2022, rot symptoms were observed 5 days after storage on fresh avocado fruits cv ""Lamb Hass"" harvested from a 3.4 ha organic orchard in Chania, Crete exhibiting 30% symptom incidence. Brownish-green sunken lesions and soft rot with dark brown lesions covering up to 50% of the mesocarp on fruits and blackish soft lesions on fruit stem ends were observed. To isolate the pathogens, fruits were surface sterilized using 1% NaOCl for 1 min, placed in 70% ethanol for 30 s and washed twice with sterile distilled water. Then, small pieces were excised from the fruit rot margins and transferred on PDA amended with 0.015% streptomycin-sulfate. Single-spore isolates were incubated on PDA for 10 days and subjected to morphological examination. Two distinct pathogenic fungal isolates were obtained, and their symptoms were re-examined on avocado fruits. The first isolate (A1) obtained from the fruit stem end, initially produced hyaline dense aerial mycelia, being gray and black on the upper and lower surface of the Petri dishes, respectively. The second isolate (A2) obtained from the main body of the fruit, formed round, grayish colonies, with orange conidial aggregates. Based on morphological characteristics (Phillips et al.,2013; Weir et al., 2012), isolates were preliminary identified as Neofusicoccum sp. (A1) and Colletotrichum sp. (A2). Isolates were molecularly identified by sequencing of the ITS-5.8S rRNA, translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) and beta-tubulin (tub2) genes. PCRs were conducted using primer pairs ITS4/ITS5, EF1-728F/EF1986R and Bt2a/Bt2b as well as ITS4/ITS5 and 5'-tef1/3'-tef1 and Bt2a/Bt2b for isolates A1 and A2, respectively (Carbone &amp; Kohn, 1999; Glass &amp; Donaldson, 1995; Rojas et al., 2010; Weir et al., 2012; White et al., 1990). The sequences were deposited into GenBank under the accession numbers OQ852465, OQ867962, OQ867965 for N. luteum and, OQ852466, OQ867963 and OQ867964 for C. gloeosporioides. Based on Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), a phylogenetic tree was constructed using concatenated sequences, following Kimura's two parameter model (1980), which confirmed their identity as N luteum and C. gloeosporioides strains. Mature avocado fruits (cv. Hass) were surface sterilized and dried. Consequently, incised fruits were inoculated with mycelial agar plugs (5 mm in diameter) cut from the edge of rapidly growing colonies of N. luteum and C. gloeosporioides strains. Fruits incubated in moist chambers and at 25°C for 5 days in the dark. Fruit bodies and stems were inoculated with the respective isolates and sterile agar plugs in the case of the control. Five fruits were used for each pathogenic trial per fungal isolate, which was repeated twice. After symptom occurrence, these pathogenic isolates were re-isolated successfully and molecularly identified, while exhibiting similar to original symptoms confirming Koch's postulates. While other reports exist on the presence of these pathogens in different countries worldwide, this is the first report of C. gloeosporioides and N. luteum as post-harvest pathogens of avocado, which is an economically important crop of Crete, in Greece (Akgül et al., 2016). This study provides the means for the accurate identification of these fungal pathogens causing avocado fruit rots and taking into consideration the available treatment options can contribute to establishing effective management strategies."

Wetlands are of great importance for providing the appropriate conditions for the diversity of species and inhabitants living in these ecosystems and for a wide range of public goods and services (fresh water, air filtering, recreational and tourism opportunities). However, despite their importance, wetlands are continuously degraded due to various human activities at an alarming rate worldwide. In the context of this study and considering the rational management of wetlands and the inevitable impact of climate change, a wetland, spatiotemporal monitoring system is proposed, implemented in the karst wetland of Almyros Stream (Heraklion, Crete, Greece). The implementation of this system is based on robust techniques from the allied fields of chemistry, earth and ecology assisted by GIS techniques. Our results indicate that this Mediterranean karst wetland of great ecological importance is under pressure because of pollution, climate change and land change. This argument is supported by (a) the high concentrations of water photosynthetic pigments and nutrients at certain times of the year, both provided by chemical analysis and partially verified by geophysical monitoring (spectral induced polarization) and (b) the high values of soil magnetic susceptibility at sites close to human infrastructures that is an indicator of heavy metals concentrations.

"<i>Ceratonia siliqua</i> L., commonly known as the carob tree, appears in most Mediterranean countries, often cultivated for the collection of its fruits to be used as food for humans and animals. This study was aimed at the phytochemical characterization of two common Cretan <i>C. siliqua</i> cultivars and the biological evaluation of deseeded pod and seed extracts regarding their putative use in cosmetics. Gas and liquid chromatographic techniques were used to assess their essential oil, fatty acid, and carbohydrate profiles. Cell-free assays, including free-radical scavenging; the inhibition of tyrosinase and collagenase; the blocking of advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation; along with assays in human skin fibroblast cultures, i.e., reactive oxygen species suppression, glutathione stimulation, and protection from oxidative stress and from ultraviolet (UVB) radiation, were also used. Extracts from both cultivars were found to possess antioxidant capacity, tyrosinase- and collagenase-inhibitory activities, an ability to block glucose-induced AGEs, and in certain cases, UVB absorbance and photoprotective activities. Seed extracts were in general more active, while the use of 30% aqueous methanol seemed to be more efficient than n-hexane for extraction. Serial partition of the most active extracts resulted in fractions with enriched biological activities. These properties make Cretan carob extracts and their fractions suitable candidates for use in cosmetics."

Spatial variability of Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Fe, Mn, Pb and metallothionein (MT) concentrations were determined in mesozooplankton samples along the west-east axis of the Cretan Passage in the western Levantine Sea (Eastern Mediterranean). Metal and MT values from the present study are proposed as background levels, due to the lack of substantial anthropogenic activities in the area, where only maritime traffic and atmospheric deposition could be potential sources. Higher concentrations, of both metals and MTs, were recorded mainly at the western stations indicating higher metal bioavailability than in the eastern part. An inverse relationship of the metal zooplankton levels with zooplankton biomass, abundance and vital rates (production, respiration and ingestion rates), as well as salinity, was evident. We discuss the hypothesis that physical and biological characteristics of the marine environment, affecting growth dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities, may also act on metal uptake in oligotrophic marine systems.

"The need for effective therapeutic regimens for non-critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic remained largely unmet. Previous work has shown that a combination of three aromatic plants' essential oils (CAPeo) (<i>Thymbra capitata</i> (L.) Cav., <i>Origanum dictamnus</i> L., <i>Salvia fruticose</i> Mill.) has remarkable in vitro antiviral activity. Given its properties, it was urgent to explore its potential in treating mild COVID-19 patients in primary care settings. A total of 69 adult patients were included in a clinical proof-of-concept (PoC) intervention study. Family physicians implemented the observational study in two arms (intervention group and control group) during three study periods (IG<sub>2020, n=13</sub>, IG<sub>2021/22, n=25</sub>, and CG<sub>2021/22, n=31</sub>). The SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by real-time PCR. The CAPeo mixture was administered daily for 14 days per os in the intervention group, while the control group received usual care. The PoC study found that the number and frequency of general symptoms, including general fatigue, weakness, fever, and myalgia, decreased following CAPeo administration. By Day 7, the average presence (number) of symptoms decreased in comparison with Day 1 in IG (4.7 to 1.4) as well as in CG (4.0 to 3.1), representing a significant decrease in the cumulative presence in IC (-3.3 vs. -0.9, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; η<sup>2</sup> = 0.20) on Day 7 and on Day 14 (-4.2 vs. -2.9, <i>p</i> = 0.027; η<sup>2</sup> = 0.08). Our findings suggest that CAPeo possesses potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in addition tο its effect against influenza A and B and human rhinovirus HRV14 strains. The early and effective impact on alleviating key symptoms of COVID-19 may suggest this mixture can act as a complementary natural agent for patients with mild COVID-19."

Results showed that all TTX analogues were less toxic than the parent TTX, their TEFs being in the range of 0.75-0.011. Then, different tissues of three <i>Lagocephalus sceleratus</i> individuals were analyzed with CBA and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The obtained TEFs were applied to the TTX analogues' concentrations obtained by LC-MS/MS analysis, providing an indication of the overall toxicity of the sample.

In this work, TTX analogues were isolated from the liver of a <i>Lagocephalus sceleratus</i> individual caught on South Crete coasts. A cell-based assay (CBA) for TTXs was optimized and applied to the establishment of the TEFs of 5,11-dideoxyTTX, 11-norTTX-6(<i>S</i>)-ol, 11-deoxyTTX and 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX. Results showed that all TTX analogues were less toxic than the parent TTX, their TEFs being in the range of 0.75-0.011. Then, different tissues of three <i>Lagocephalus sceleratus</i> individuals were analyzed with CBA and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The obtained TEFs were applied to the TTX analogues' concentrations obtained by LC-MS/MS analysis, providing an indication of the overall toxicity of the sample. Information about the TEFs of TTX analogues is valuable for food safety control, allowing the estimation of the risk of fish products to consumers.

Metal and MT values from the present study are proposed as background levels, due to the lack of substantial anthropogenic activities in the area, where only maritime traffic and atmospheric deposition could be potential sources. Higher concentrations, of both metals and MTs, were recorded mainly at the western stations indicating higher metal bioavailability than in the eastern part. An inverse relationship of the metal zooplankton levels with zooplankton biomass, abundance and vital rates (production, respiration and ingestion rates), as well as salinity, was evident. We discuss the hypothesis that physical and biological characteristics of the marine environment, affecting growth dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities, may also act on metal uptake in oligotrophic marine systems.

"In Primary Health Care (PHC) many interstitial lung disease (ILD) cases may remain at diagnostic delay, due to their challenging presentation and the limited experience of general practitioners (GPs) in recognizing their early symptoms. We have designed a feasibility study to investigate early ILD case-finding competency between PHC and tertiary care. A cross-sectional prospective case-finding study was launched at two private health care centers of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, during nine months (2021-2022). After clinical assessment by GP, PHC attenders, who agreed to participate in the study, were referred to the Respiratory Medicine Department, University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, underwent Lung Ultrasound (LUS) and those with an overall suspicion for ILDs underwent high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used. Multiple Poisson regression analysis was performed to explain positive LUS and HRCT decision with selected variables. One hundred and nine patients out of 183 were finally included (54.1% females; mean age 61, SD: 8.3 years). Thirty-five (32.1%) were current smokers. Overall, two out of ten cases were assessed to need HRCT due to a moderate or high suspicion (19.3%; 95%CI 12.7, 27.4). However, in those who had dyspnea in relation to counterparts, a significantly higher percentage of patients with LUS findings (57.9% vs. 34.0%, p=0.013) was found, as in those who had crackles (100.0% vs. 44.2%, p= 0.005). Detected possible ILD provisional labelling cases were 6, and most importantly, 5 of those cases were considered highly suspicious for further evaluation based on LUS findings. This is a feasibility study exploring potentials by combining data of medical history, basic auscultation skills, as crackles detection, and inexpensive and radiation-free imaging technique, such as LUS. Cases of ILD labeling may be hidden within PHC, sometimes, much before any clinical manifestation."

"The aim of this study was to present the 3-year outcomes after simultaneous transepithelial phototherapeutic keratectomy (t-PTK) and conventional photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) followed by corneal crosslinking (CXL) for keratoconus. In this prospective, interventional case series, patients with progressive keratoconus underwent simultaneous t-PTK and conventional PRK followed by CXL (Cretan protocol plus). Visual, refractive, and topographic outcomes were evaluated along with endothelial cell density (ECD) preoperatively and at 1, 2, and 3 years postoperatively. Twenty-two patients (31 eyes) were enrolled. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed in any of the patients. Logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) mean uncorrected and mean corrected distance visual acuity improved from 0.81 ± 0.40 and 0.18 ± 0.21 preoperatively to 0.38 ± 0.33 ( P &lt; 0.001) and 0.06 ± 0.12 ( P &lt; 0.001) at 3-year follow-up. Mean spherical equivalent improved from -5.39 ± 3.89 diopters (D) preoperatively to -2.29 ± 2.65 D ( P &lt; 0.001) at 3 years postoperatively. Mean corneal astigmatism reduced from -4.70 ± 2.86 D preoperatively to -3.55 ± 2.45 D ( P = 0.001) at 3 years postoperatively. No ECD alterations were observed throughout the 3-year follow-up ( P &gt; 0.05).

"Dysphagia is defined as any feeding or swallowing dysfunction at one or more stages of digestion. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of dysphagia symptoms in children and adolescents with neurological disorders and its relationship with the specific characteristics of the subjects. Using data from general hospital/paediatric department visits in Heraklion, Crete, Greece, a cross-sectional study design was implemented over a seven-month period (2017-18), and a total of 268 children and adolescents were recruited. Demographic data and medical profiles were recorded, focusing on the most obvious and frequent clinical features of feeding and swallowing disorders per stage (oral-OS, pharyngeal-PS, and oesophageal-ES). In the sample, 54.9% were boys and the mean age was 5.9 years; the most prevalent International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) disorder was mental and behavioural disorders (37.3%). The prevalence of dysphagia symptoms was 24.3% during the OS (95% CI: 19.0-29.9), 18.3% in the PS (95% CI: 14.0-23.2), and 20.1% in the ES (95% CI: 15.7-25.4). At least one symptom of dysphagia was observed during the OS, PS, and ES in 42.5% (95% CI: 36.7-48.5) of the sample. The presence of dysphagia seems to be related to lower age (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.45, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), higher ICD-10 comorbidity (OR = 1.89, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), or medication use (OR = 2.31, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). A high prevalence of dysphagia was found in children and adolescents with neurological disorders, while lower age, comorbidity, and medication use emerged as factors that required better management."

"There is growing evidence associating inflammatory markers in complex, higher order neurological functions, such as cognition and memory. We examined whether high levels of various inflammatory markers are associated with cognitive outcomes at 4 years of age in a mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece (Rhea study). We included 642 children in this cross-sectional study. Levels of several inflammatory markers (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17α, IL-10, MIP-1α, TNF-α and the ratios of IL-6 to IL-10 and TNF-α to IL-10) were determined in child serum via immunoassay. Neurodevelopment at 4 years was assessed by means of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations between the exposures and outcomes of interest after adjustment for various confounders. Our results indicate that children with high TNF-α concentrations (≥90<sup>th</sup> percentile) in serum demonstrated decreased scores in memory (adjusted β = -4.0; 95% CI: -7.7, -0.2), working memory (adjusted β = -4.0; 95% CI: -8.0, -0.1) as well as in memory span scale (adjusted β = -4.0; 95% CI: -7.9, -0.1). We also found that children with high IFN-γ serum levels showed lower scores in memory span scale (adjusted β = -3.4; 95% CI: -7.3, -0.4). Children with elevated TNF-α/IL-10 ratio demonstrated decreased quantitative (adjusted β = -4.3; 95% CI: -8.2, -0.4), motor (adjusted β = -3.5; 95% CI: -7.5, -0.5), executive function (adjusted β = -4.8; 95% CI: -8.5, -1.1), general cognitive (adjusted β = -3.6; 95% CI: -7.3, -0.1), memory (adjusted β = -3.8; 95% CI: -7.6, -0), working memory (adjusted β = -3.5; 95% CI: -7.5, -0.5) and memory span scores (adjusted β = -5.3; 95% CI: -9.1, -1.4) The findings suggest that high levels of TNF-α may contribute to reduced memory performance at preschool age."

Nocardiosis is a rare disease affecting both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts, presented in various clinical forms ranging from localized to disseminated infection. Aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of nocardiosis, antimicrobial resistance profiles, treatment, and outcomes of Nocardia infection over the last 5 years at our institution. The medical records and microbiological data of patients affected by nocardiosis and treated at the university hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, between 2018 and 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. The isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and through sequencing of 16S rRNA. Antimicrobial susceptibility for 17 agents was determined by E-test and results were interpreted according to CLSI guidelines. Among the 28 Nocardia isolates, eight species were identified, with Nocardia brasiliensis being the most prevalent (32.1%), followed by Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (25%), and Nocardia farcinica (14.3%). Skin and soft tissue infections were the most common presentations, noted in 13 (50%) patients, followed by pulmonary infection presented in 10 (38.5%) patients. Fifteen patients (57.7%) had at least one underlying disease, and 11 (42.3%) were on immunosuppressive or long-term corticosteroid treatment. Susceptibility rates of linezolid, tigecycline, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, moxifloxacin, and imipenem were 100, 100, 96.4, 92.9, 82.1, and 42.9%, respectively. The 26 patients in this study were treated with various antibiotics. Mortality rate was 3.8%, and the patient who died had disseminated infection. Since epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility are evolving, continuous surveillance is mandatory in order to initiate appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

Nocardiosis is a rare disease affecting both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts, presented in various clinical forms ranging from localized to disseminated infection. Aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of nocardiosis, antimicrobial resistance profiles, treatment, and outcomes of Nocardia infection over the last 5 years at our institution. The medical records and microbiological data of patients affected by nocardiosis and treated at the university hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, between 2018 and 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. The isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and through sequencing of 16S rRNA. Antimicrobial susceptibility for 17 agents was determined by E-test and results were interpreted according to CLSI guidelines. Among the 28 Nocardia isolates, eight species were identified, with Nocardia brasiliensis being the most prevalent (32.1%), followed by Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (25%), and Nocardia farcinica (14.3%). Skin and soft tissue infections were the most common presentations, noted in 13 (50%) patients, followed by pulmonary infection presented in 10 (38.5%) patients. Fifteen patients (57.7%) had at least one underlying disease, and 11 (42.3%) were on immunosuppressive or long-term corticosteroid treatment. Susceptibility rates of linezolid, tigecycline, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, moxifloxacin, and imipenem were 100, 100, 96.4, 92.9, 82.1, and 42.9%, respectively. The 26 patients in this study were treated with various antibiotics. Mortality rate was 3.8%, and the patient who died had disseminated infection. Since epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility are evolving, continuous surveillance is mandatory in order to initiate appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

The fruit of Lycium barbarum L. (Solanaceae), known as goji berry, has been exploited for a long time in traditional Chinese medicine. In recent decades, it has received much attention as one of the trendiest functional foods with a wide array of pharmacological activities in Western diets. In this study the phenolic profile and potential antioxidant capacity of Lycium barbarum cultivated in Crete (Greece) were investigated. The berries were defatted with hexane and then extracted with dichloromethane and methanol using a Soxhlet apparatus. Furthermore, the methanol extract was fractionated with ethyl acetate and butanol. All fractions/extracts were tested for their antioxidant activity (DPPH, FRAP, chemiluminescence). Folin-Ciocalteu and LC-DAD-MS analyses were utilized for the identification of the phenolic compounds. The total phenolic content ranged from 14.13 ± 0.40 (water fraction) to 109.72 ± 4.09 (ethyl acetate fraction) mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry extract. Ethyl acetate extract exhibited the highest scavenging activities determined as EC<sub>50</sub> (4.73 ± 0.20 mg/mL) and IC<sub>50</sub> (0.47 ± 0.001 mg/mL) using DPPH and chemiluminescence assays. Seventeen phenolic compounds, including cinnamoylquinic acids and derivatives, hydrocinnamic acids and flavonoid derivatives, were tentatively identified. To the best of our knowledge, quercetin 3-O-hexose coumaric ester and quercetin 3-O-hexose-O-hexose-O-rhamnose are reported for the first time in goji berry fruits. The results of this study suggest that consumption of goji berry fruits could serve as a potential source of natural antioxidant compounds and that goji berry phenolic extracts could be exploited for nutritional pharmaceutical purposes.

"Transvaginal ultrasound imaging has become an essential tool in the prenatal evaluation of the lower uterine segment and anatomy of the cervix, but there are only limited data on the role of transvaginal ultrasound in the management of patients at high risk of placenta accreta spectrum at birth. This study aimed to evaluate the role of transvaginal sonography in the third trimester of pregnancy in predicting outcomes in patients with a high probability of placenta accreta spectrum at birth. This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients presenting with a singleton pregnancy and a history of at least 1 previous cesarean delivery and patients diagnosed prenatally with an anterior low-lying placenta or placenta previa delivered electively after 32 weeks of gestation. All patients had a least 1 detailed ultrasound examination, including transabdominal and transvaginal scans, within 2 weeks before delivery. Of note, 2 experienced operators, blinded to the clinical data, were asked to make a judgment on the likelihood of placenta accreta spectrum as a binary, low or high-probability of placenta accreta spectrum, and to predict the main surgical outcome (conservative vs peripartum hysterectomy). The diagnosis of accreta placentation was confirmed when one or more placental cotyledons could not be digitally separated from the uterine wall at delivery or during the gross examination of the hysterectomy or partial myometrial resection specimens. A total of 111 patients were included in the study. Abnormal placental tissue attachment was found in 76 patients (68.5%) at birth, and histologic examination confirmed superficial villous attachment (creta) and deep villous attachment (increta) in 11 and 65 cases, respectively. Of note, 72 patients (64.9%) had a peripartum hysterectomy, including 13 cases with no evidence of placenta accreta spectrum at birth because of failure to reconstruct the lower uterine segment and/or excessive bleeding. There was a significant difference in the distribution of placental location (X<sup>2</sup>=12.66; P=.002) between transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound examinations, but both ultrasound techniques had similar likelihood scores in identifying accreta placentation that was confirmed at birth. On transabdominal scan, only a high lacuna score was significantly associated (P=.02) with an increased chance of hysterectomy, whereas on transvaginal scan, significant associations were found between the need for hysterectomy and the thickness of the distal part of the lower uterine segment (P=.003), changes in the cervix structure (P=.01), cervix increased vascularity (P=.001), and the presence of placental lacunae (P=.005). The odds ratio for peripartum hysterectomy were 5.01 (95% confidence interval, 1.25-20.1) for a very thin (&lt;1-mm) distal lower uterine segment and 5.62 (95% confidence interval, 1.41-22.5) for a lacuna score of 3+. Transvaginal ultrasound examination contributes to both prenatal management and the prediction of surgical outcomes in patients with a history of previous cesarean delivery with and without ultrasound signs suggestive of placenta accreta spectrum. Transvaginal ultrasound examination of the lower uterine segment and cervix should be included in clinical protocols for the preoperative evaluation of patients at risk of complex cesarean delivery."

Maritime transport is a vital sector for global trade and the world economy. Particularly for islands, there is also an important social dimension of this sector, since island communities strongly rely on it for a connection with the mainland and the transportation of goods and passengers. Furthermore, islands are exceptionally vulnerable to climate change, as the rising sea level and extreme events are expected to induce severe impacts. Such hazards are anticipated to also affect the operations of the maritime transport sector by affecting either the port infrastructure or ships en route. The present study is an effort to better comprehend and assess the future risk of maritime transport disruption in six European islands and archipelagos, and it aims at supporting regional to local policy and decision-making. We employ state-of-the-art regional climate datasets and the widely used impact chain approach to identify the different components that might drive such risks. Larger islands (e.g., Corsica, Cyprus and Crete) are found to be more resilient to the impacts of climate change on maritime operations. Our findings also highlight the importance of adopting a low-emission pathway, since this will keep the risk of maritime transport disruption similar to present levels or even slightly decreased for some islands because of an enhanced adaptation capacity and advantageous demographic changes.

The objective is to assess the perception of gynecologists regarding patients' adherence to vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) treatments, to evaluate the gynecologists' opinions on what their patients think about treatment adherence, and to compare the gynecologists' opinions with the patients' own perceptions within the CRETA study. Spanish gynecologists who participated in the CRETA study were asked to fill out an online 41-item questionnaire to evaluate their views on VVA management. From 29 centers across Spain, 44 gynecologists completed the survey. Their mean age was 47.2 years old, two-thirds of them were women, and the average professional experience was over 20 years. According to the gynecologists, the therapy most frequently used by VVA-diagnosed women was vaginal moisturizers (45.5%), followed by local estrogen therapy (36.4%) and ospemifene (18.2%). Nevertheless, ospemifene was viewed as the therapeutic option with the most efficacy, easiest route of administration, shorter time to symptom improvement, lower percentage of dropouts, and higher treatment adherence. Spanish gynecologists are in general agreement with their patients regarding VVA treatment preferences and the main issues for adherence and effectiveness. However, there is an opportunity for doctor-patient communication improvement. Among the three therapeutic options evaluated, ospemifene is regarded as offering some competitive advantages.

Canine pathogens transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods are of significant importance for veterinary and, in some cases, human health. However, they are still underestimated and rarely investigated in many parts of the Mediterranean region, mostly due to financial reasons. Therefore, in the present paper, we investigated the occurrence of blood-associated pathogens affecting dogs in Crete, Greece. For this purpose, blood samples from 103 shelter dogs were screened for the pathogens by PCR and serological tests. Overall, samples from 43 dogs scored positive for at least one pathogen (41.8%). In particular, antibodies to Leishmania infantum were detected in 26 dogs (25.2%), and 15 and 11 animals were positive for Hepatozoon canis (14.6%) and Mycoplasma haemocanis (10.7%) by PCR, respectively. Co-infections were recorded in nine animals. Clinical signs indicative of infection (alterations of skin or coat or reduced body condition) were detected in 10 animals, four of which were infected with one pathogen, three with two pathogens. Based on the results obtained, dogs from Crete appear to be frequently exposed to several blood-borne pathogens, including agents of zoonotic concern. Given that some of the pathogens were reported for the first time in this area, results presented in our study should improve the awareness of the local veterinarians and of dog rescue organisations in order to reduce disease burden on stray and owned dogs and to control the spread of canine vector-borne diseases from Greece to non-endemic areas by travelling or exported infected dogs.

Variability in long-distance migration strategies is still poorly understood due to the fact that individuals are often tracked from a single colony/population. Transoceanic migrations of Scopoli's shearwaters (<i>Calonectris diomedea</i>) across the Strait of Gibraltar (SoG) have been tracked from several breeding colonies isolatedly, and factors related to the variability in phenological schedules among different populations remain, therefore, not well-understood. Using light-level geolocator data, I examined the autumn (postbreeding) and spring (prebreeding) migratory passage dates through SoG of four populations of Scopoli's shearwater spread along the longitudinal breeding range of the species. Additionally, I also estimated the at-sea activity patterns (from immersion data) during both migratory passages, as well as the body size (from morphometric data) of the individuals of these populations. On average, Scopoli's shearwaters leave the Mediterranean (cross SoG) on 31 October ± 1.8 days on their autumn migrations and return on 03 March ± 1.6 days on their spring migrations. At the population level, there was a clear gradient in the timing of crossing SoG: birds from the westernmost populations (Murcia, SE Spain) were the first ones in leaving the Mediterranean while easternmost breeders (Paximada, Crete) were the last ones. In spring, only birds from the largest breeding population (Zembra, Tunisia) seemed to advance their return and crossed SoG significantly earlier than birds tracked at the remaining populations. In both passages, shearwaters from central and eastern populations spent more time flying than their conspecifics from the western Mediterranean. Scopoli's shearwater populations display a differential phenology and behavior in their migratory passages through SoG. The longitudinal gradient in body size already reported for the species could be an evolutionary response to an obvious trade-off between sharing common wintering grounds in the Atlantic Ocean and the temporal constraints of restoring physiological condition in those grounds.

Few series of osteomyelitis due to multi-drug (MDR) or extensively-drug resistant (XDR) gram-negative bacteria exist. A retrospective study of MDR and XDR gram-negative osteomyelitis cases was performed, aiming to investigate causative organisms, proper surgical and medical management, as well as outcome. All patients, treated at the University hospital of Crete between 2007 and 2016 for acute osteomyelitis, due to MDR or XDR gram-negative pathogens were evaluated. A total of 14 patients (8 males) were identified with a mean age of 50.6 years. Five Acinetobacter baumanii cases, 3 XDR and 2 MDR, were found. Furthermore, 3 MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae and 3 MDR Enterobacter cloacae isolates were identified. Additionally, 2 MDR Escherichia coli, as well as 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 XDR and 1 MDR, were isolated. One case of Roseomonas gilardii was also identified. In 5 cases the same pathogen was also isolated from blood. Five out of the 14 patients were smokers, 6 were suffering severe injury, 4 had diabetes-mellitus, 2 chronic renal disease and 2 were obese. Most causative organisms had hospital origin. All patients received first line empirical combination antimicrobial treatment, proven effective in 4. Thirteen patients were also subjected to surgical treatment. The study included mainly young individuals, most likely due to the high incidence of traffic accidents involving young adults in Crete. Antimicrobial regimens are important supplements to surgical treatment of acute osteomyelitis. However, due to emergence of resistant microorganisms, compliance with strict rules of antimicrobial strategy is of utmost importance.

Several important habitats have become threatened in the last few centuries in the Mediterranean Basin due to major changes adopted in land-use practices. The consequent loss of natural and seminatural orchid habitats leads to the appreciation of small anthropogenic habitats, such as cemeteries and roadside verges. Colonization of cemeteries and roadside verges by orchids has long been known, but no study to date compared the suitability of these two anthropogenic habitats for orchids. Therefore, in this paper our aim was to survey cemeteries and roadside verges and to compare these two habitats regarding their role in conserving Mediterranean terrestrial orchids. We conducted field surveys in three Mediterranean islands, Cyprus, Crete, and Lesbos, where both cemeteries and roadside verges were sampled on a geographically representative scale. We found a total of almost 7,000 orchid individuals, belonging to 77 species in the two anthropogenic habitat types. Roadside verges hosted significantly more individuals than cemeteries in Crete and Lesbos, and significantly more species across all three islands. Our results suggest that although cemeteries have a great potential conservation value in other parts of the world, intensive maintenance practices that characterized cemeteries in these three islands renders them unable to sustain valuable plant communities. On the other hand, roadside verges play a prominent role in the conservation of Mediterranean orchids in Cyprus and Greece. The pioneer status of roadside verges facilitates their fast colonization, while roads serve as ecological corridors in fragmented landscapes.

The odds ratio for peripartum hysterectomy were 5.01 (95% confidence interval, 1.25-20.1) for a very thin (&lt;1-mm) distal lower uterine segment and 5.62 (95% confidence interval, 1.41-22.5) for a lacuna score of 3+. Transvaginal ultrasound examination contributes to both prenatal management and the prediction of surgical outcomes in patients with a history of previous cesarean delivery with and without ultrasound signs suggestive of placenta accreta spectrum. Transvaginal ultrasound examination of the lower uterine segment and cervix should be included in clinical protocols for the preoperative evaluation of patients at risk of complex cesarean delivery."

Mammas, Consultant Paediatrician on the island of Euboea (Greece) and Coordinator of the Paediatric Virology Study Group. 	Born in Chalkida in Greece, Dr Ioannis N. Mammas, Consultant Paediatrician on the island of Euboea, studied Medicine at the University of Crete School of Medicine, where he received his MD in 2002 and his PhD in Clinical Virology in 2006. He was trained in Paediatrics and Neonatology in Merseyside (UK), attending the 'Alder Hey' Children's Hospital's specialty training (ST) rotation programme and in Athens (Greece) at the 'Penteli' Children's Hospital and the 'MAKKA' Paediatric Infectious Diseases (PID) Unit of the 'Aghia Sophia' Children's Hospital. On October 10th, 2015, he presented the Paediatric Virology subspecialty's proposal, which up-to-date has attracted the critical interest of several international experts in the scientific fields of Neonatology, Paediatrics, PID and Virology and has been evaluated as a unique project of innovation in medical education. According to Dr Mammas, Paediatrics is the specialty, which daily provides the opportunity to support with responsibility the children's smile, the hope of life and future. He highlights the significant role of the Paediatric Virology Study Group (PVSG), a paediatric think tank, which was established by a group of paediatric trainees and young paediatricians in 2007 and since then has been involved with enthusiasm in the perspectives of Paediatric Virology in medical education. Dr Mammas strongly believes that in the future, Paediatric Virology subspecialists will have a strategically principal role, both clinical and academic, at the fight against viral infections in childhood. This aim will be supported by the newly founded Institute of Paediatric Virology (IPV), the first scientific initiative in the world committed to medical education on neonatal and paediatric viral infections.

"The present study aims to explore the association of maternal sleep disturbances during late pregnancy on child neuropsychological and behavioral development in preschool years. The study included 638 mother-child pairs from the prospective Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece. Information on antenatal sleep disturbances was collected through a computer-assisted interview. Children's neuropsychological and behavioral development was assessed using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA), the Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Test (ADHDT), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Multivariate analysis showed that maternal sleep duration less than 8 h was associated with reduced scores in the general cognitive scale (β = -2.28, 95% CI -4.54, -0.02, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.417) and memory span (β = -3.24, 95% CI -5.72, -0.77, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.304), while mild-severe daytime sleepiness was associated with reduced scores in the memory scale (β = -5.42, 95% CI -10.47, -0.37, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.304), memory span (β = -5.44, 95% CI -10.68, -0.21, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.304), nd functions of posterior cortex (β = -5.55, 95% CI -10.40, -0.70, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.393) of MSCA. Snoring in late pregnancy was related to higher child hyperactivity scores in SDQ (β = 1.05, 95% CI 0.16, 1.95, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.160). An interaction between child sex and maternal sleep duration in response to ADHD symptoms was also found (p for interaction &lt; 0.05). Stratified analysis revealed increased hyperactivity, inattention, and ADHD total scores for girls of mothers with sleep duration less than 8 h. Maternal sleep disturbances during pregnancy may be associated with impaired child neuropsychological and behavioral development during the preschool years. Early detection and intervention is necessary to reduce sleep disturbances habits in pregnancy and improve child neurodevelopment."

"Upon finding skeletal unidentified remains, four are the questions that must be answered: age, sex, ancestry, and stature. Regarding age estimation, clavicle has received special attention because medial epiphysis is the last epiphysis, among long bones that ossifies. Falys and Prangle proposed a method of age estimation based on three degenerative characteristics-surface topography (TOP), Porosity (POR) and Osteophyte formation (OST)-evaluated on the sternal end of the clavicle according to the descriptions and the illustrations provided in the original article producing satisfactory results. The current study aims to test the applicability of the Falys' and Prangle's method on 174 individuals from two contemporary samples, one from Greece (Cretan osteological Collection and Athens Forensic Anthropology Lab collection) and one from Thailand (Osteological collection in Chiang Mai). Composite scores were calculated, inter and intra- observer error were estimated by kappa statistics and regression equations of the original study were tested in our sample and in subsamples divided by sex and population. The Greek sample gave more accurate estimates compared to the Thai sample. Regressions of known sex gave slightly better results in most cases. When individuals &lt;40 years old were excluded, classification increased for both Thai and Greeks. The results of this pilot study indicate that there are morphological features on the clavicle that are highly correlated with age. Thus, there is a scope of expanding research on the morphological features of the collar bone."

Six new species from Crete belonging to the family Neanuridae are described and illustrated in detail. Friesea schulzi sp. nov. is characterized by having white body, 3 + 3 ocelli, 4 anal spines and furca and retinaculum absent (stage 5). Friesea cretensis sp. nov. can be easily identified by 5 + 5 ocelli, 4 anal spines and 6 microchaetae in furcal field. Characteristic and recognizable character of Pseudachorutella ellisi sp. nov. is very long buccal cone. Deutonura schulzi sp. nov. differs from other taxa in the genus in the presence of internal tooth on claw. Endonura zelkovae sp. nov. is especially distinctive due to the presence 3+s and 4+s chaetae De on Th. II and III. The main characteristics of Cryptonura ellisi sp. nov. include a massive mandibles and high number of mandibular teeth.

Over 80% of the global population addresses their primary healthcare needs using traditional medicine based on medicinal plants. Consequently, there's a rising demand for these plants for both household and industrial use at local, regional, national, and international levels. However, wild harvesting has negatively impacted natural ecosystems. Cultivating medicinal species has been proposed as a conservation strategy to alleviate this pressure. Yet, in this age of global climate change concerns, smallholder farmers' views on the benefits of such cultivation clash with the uncertainties of climate change impacts, amplifying their anxieties. In this context, the climate change dependence of ex situ cultivation of ten wild medicinal taxa with significant ethnopharmacological interest in Crete, Greece, were studied, projecting their potential habitat suitability under various future climate scenarios. The results demonstrated species-specific effects. Based on the potential cultivation area gains and losses, these effects can be categorized into three groups. We also outlined the spatial patterns of these gains and losses, offering valuable insights for regional management strategies benefiting individual practitioners.

The objective is to assess the perception of gynecologists regarding patients' adherence to vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) treatments, to evaluate the gynecologists' opinions on what their patients think about treatment adherence, and to compare the gynecologists' opinions with the patients' own perceptions within the CRETA study. Spanish gynecologists who participated in the CRETA study were asked to fill out an online 41-item questionnaire to evaluate their views on VVA management. From 29 centers across Spain, 44 gynecologists completed the survey. Their mean age was 47.2 years old, two-thirds of them were women, and the average professional experience was over 20 years. According to the gynecologists, the therapy most frequently used by VVA-diagnosed women was vaginal moisturizers (45.5%), followed by local estrogen therapy (36.4%) and ospemifene (18.2%). Nevertheless, ospemifene was viewed as the therapeutic option with the most efficacy, easiest route of administration, shorter time to symptom improvement, lower percentage of dropouts, and higher treatment adherence. Spanish gynecologists are in general agreement with their patients regarding VVA treatment preferences and the main issues for adherence and effectiveness. However, there is an opportunity for doctor-patient communication improvement. Among the three therapeutic options evaluated, ospemifene is regarded as offering some competitive advantages.

Chohan Continuous Squeezing Suture (ACCSS) for Controlling Haemorrhage from the Lower Uterine Segment at Caesarean Section. 	To describe the simplicity, efficacy and safety of A. Chohan Continuous Squeezing Suture (ACCSS) for controlling haemorrhage from the lower uterine segment at caesarean section for placenta praevia and accreta spectrum disorders. This prospective study was conducted on 47 patients with placenta praevia and accreta spectrum disorders from February 2019 to May 2022 in two teaching hospitals of Lahore and ACCSS was applied. The outcome measures were peripartum hysterectomy procedure time, estimated blood loss, number of blood transfusions, duration of stay in the hospital, bladder trauma, uterine necrosis, pelvic abscess formation, secondary postpartum haemorrhage and maternal mortality. Descriptive statistics were calculated by using SPSS version 21. Out of 47 patients, 7 (15%) had placenta creta, 29 (61.7%) increta, 11 (23.3%) percreta (grade 3a), and 36 (76.6%) central anterior dominant placenta. Peripartum hysterectomy was prevented in 97.8% of patients. ACCSS procedure time was 5-10 minutes (87.2%), with mean blood loss 2500±485 ml, mean blood transfusion 1.85±1.02 units and mean hospital stay of 3.3±0.84 days. One patient had bladder trauma. There was no case of uterine necrosis, pelvic abscess formation, secondary postpartum haemorrhage or maternal mortality. ACCSS appears to be a simple, effective and safe treatment option for placenta praevia and accreta spectrum disorders, as an alternative to hysterectomy.

"Work-related musculoskeletal injuries and disorders (WMSD) are a significant cause of morbidity in the health care sector. Healthcare professionals are routinely exposed to various physical and psychosocial factors that increase the risk of developing a WMSD. Nurses are more susceptible to the manifestation of such disorders. A cross-sectional study was conducted during the second semester of 2020. The Nordic Questionnaire (NMQ) was used to investigate the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms, the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST) for stress detection, and a data collection sheet was developed for the registration of clinical, demographic, and anthropometric characteristics of the nursing personnel of the tertiary hospital unit of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. A percentage of 82% of nurses had developed at least one musculoskeletal symptom in the last 12 months. The most common anatomical areas at which symptoms were present the last 12 months were the neck (53.9%), shoulders (50.8%), and the lower back (49.5%). The same areas were also the reported anatomical regions, most affected by musculoskeletal symptoms when stress levels were high. Absence from work was associated with the onset of musculoskeletal symptoms (p&lt;0.001), while nurses' financial expenses (out-of-pocket payment) appeared to be associated with the onset of any symptom at 12 months, musculoskeletal symptoms limiting everyday activity at 12 months, and current musculoskeletal symptoms (p=0.001, p=0.002, and p=0.002 respectively). Musculoskeletal disorders were common among the nursing personnel. Higher levels of stress were related with a higher prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms."

After the domestication of goats around 10,000 years before the present (BP), humans transported goats far beyond the range of their wild ancestor, the bezoar goat. This brought domestic goats into contact with many wild goat species such as ibex and markhor, enabling introgression between domestic and wild goats. To investigate this, while shedding light on the taxonomic status of wild and domestic goats, we analysed genome-wide SNP data of 613 specimens from 14 taxonomic units, including Capra hircus, C. pyrenaica, C. ibex (from Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Slovenia), C. aegagrus aegagrus, C. a. cretica, C. h. dorcas, C. caucasica caucasica, C. c. severtzovi, C. c. cylindricornis, C. falconeri, C. sibirica sibirica, C. s. alaiana and C. nubiana, as well as Oreamnos americanus (mountain goat) as an outgroup. To trace gene flow between domestic and wild goats, we integrated genotype data of local goat breeds from the Alps as well as from countries such as Spain, Greece, Türkiye, Egypt, Sudan, Iran, Russia (Caucasus and Altai) and Pakistan. Our phylogenetic analyses displayed a clear separation between bezoar-type and ibex-type clades with wild goats from the Greek islands of Crete and Youra clustered within domestic goats, confirming their feral origin. Our analyses also revealed gene flow between the lineages of Caucasian tur and domestic goats that most likely occurred before or during early domestication. Within the clade of domestic goats, analyses inferred gene flow between African and Iberian goats. The detected events of introgression were consistent with previous reports and offered interesting insights into the historical relationships among domestic and wild goats.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the adapted Cyprus Greek Lexical List a-CYLEX (GR) in a sample of 194 Greek toddlers from the island of Crete with Standard Modern Greek (SMG) as their primary language. The a-CYLEX (GR) is a parental report checklist for assessing the receptive and expressive vocabulary skills of children aged 12 months to 3:6 years. Concurrent validity of the instrument was tested via correlations with the adapted Greek version of the Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test-II (ROWPVT-II), which was administered to 124 SMG-speaking children between the ages of 2 and 3:6 years. Test-retest reliability was tested by administering the instrument two times within a 2-week interval to 59 parents (30.41% of the total sample). Statistical analyses provided strong evidence for the high internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the a-CYLEX (GR). The role of the demographic variables in vocabulary performance and the frequency of each a-CYLEX (GR) word category by age were also investigated. In conclusion, the a-CYLEX (GR) is a parental report checklist that can be used by clinicians who are interested in assessing receptive and expressive vocabulary of children during toddlerhood.

Cigarette smoke itself is an abundant source of free radicals and a major cause of oxidative stress, to which plasma antioxidants function as a vital protective and counterbalancing mechanism. The objective of this study was to investigate into the relationship between smoking status and serum and dietary micronutrient concentrations. Cross-sectional study SUBJECTS - SETTING: 502 farmers from the Valley of Messara in Crete were randomly selected and examined. Complete three-day and 24-hr recall questionnaires were collected along with anthropometrical, physical activity and clinical data from all participating subjects. After adjusting for age, gender and number of fasting days adhered to per year, current smokers were found to have a lower dietary intake of vitamin C (112.1 mg vs. 136.4 mg, p = 0.03), fibre (16.6 g vs. 19.1 g, p = 0.006) and fruits and vegetables (339 g vs. 412 g, p = 0.014), while dietary vitamin B1 intake was found to be higher (1.7 mg vs. 1.4 mg, p = 0.02) in comparison to non/ex smokers. Dietary intake of meat, folate and vitami A, E, B2, B6 and B12 did not differ between the groups. Controlling age, gender, fasting days and dietary micronutrient intake, serum folate levels were found to be lower among smokers (geometric mean 15.3 nmol/L vs. 17.7 nmol/L, p = 0.023), while serum iron and vitamin B12 levels were not affected by smoking status. Current smoking status affects dietary nutrient intake as well as plasma folate levels. The above coherence between antioxidant depletion and reduced antioxidant intake may predispose smokers to the premature development of tobacco related mortality and morbidity.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the relationships between socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle and depression status and the presence of hypercholesterolemia, among elderly individuals without known CVD. During 2005-2007, 1190 elderly (aged 65 to 100 years) men and women (from Cyprus, Mitilini, Samothraki, Cephalonia, Crete, Lemnos, Corfu and Zakynthos) were enrolled. Socio-demographic, clinical and lifestyle factors were assessed through standard procedures. Symptoms of depression were evaluated using the short-form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS, range 0-15). Dietary habits were assessed through a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total serum cholesterol &gt; 200 mg/dL or use of lipids lowering medication. 44.6% of males and 61.9% of females had hypercholesterolemia (p &lt; 0.001). Only, 63% of hypercholesterolemic participants were under special diet or pharmaceutical treatment. Hypercholisterolemic individuals had higher prevalence of obesity (43% vs. 25%), hypertension (76% vs. 57%) and diabetes (25% vs. 17%) compared with normal participants (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, hypercholisterolemic participants showed higher depression levels (p = 0.002). After adjusting for various confounders, GDS score and BMI correlated with 13% (95%CI 0.98-1.30) and 14% (95%CI 0.99-1.31) higher likelihood of having hypercholesterolemia. A considerable proportion of our elderly sample had hypercholesterolemia, while 1/3 of them were untreated. Furthermore, presence of hypercholesterolemia was correlated with depressive symptomatology and increased BMI."

"The reevaluation of ""forgotten"" antibiotics can identify new therapeutic options against extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We sought to investigate isepamicin in this regard. We retrospectively evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of Enterobacteriaceae sp. isolates from unique patients, collected at the microbiological laboratory of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, from 2004 to 2009. Susceptibility testing was done with the automated Vitek 2 system. The breakpoints for susceptibility to isepamicin, tigecycline, and other antibiotics were those proposed by the Comité de l'Antibiogramme de la Société Française de Microbiologie (CA-SFM), the FDA, and the CLSI, respectively. A total of 6,296 isolates were studied, including primarily 3,401 (54.0%) Escherichia coli, 1,040 (16.5%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 590 (9.4%) Proteus mirabilis, and 460 (7.3%) Enterobacter sp. isolates. Excluding the species with intrinsic resistance to each antibiotic, antimicrobial susceptibility was highest for colistin (5,275/5,441 isolates [96.9%]) and isepamicin (6,103/6,296 [96.9%]), followed by meropenem (5,890/6,296 [93.6%]), imipenem (5,874/6,296 [93.3%]), and amikacin (5,492/6,296 [87.2%]). The antimicrobial susceptibility of the 1,040 K. pneumoniae isolates was highest for isepamicin (95.3%), followed by colistin (89.3%) and meropenem (63.0%). Regarding resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to isepamicin was observed for 91.1% of the 392, 87.7% of the 375, and 85.6% of the 111 isolates that were nonsusceptible to the carbapenems, all other aminoglycosides, and colistin, respectively. Isepamicin exhibited high in vitro activity against almost all of the Enterobacteriaceae species. It could particularly serve as a last-resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in our region, where it is endemic, as it does not show considerable cross-resistance with other aminoglycosides."

Different language skills are considered fundamental for successful reading and spelling acquisition. Extensive evidence has highlighted the central role of phonological awareness in early literacy experiences. However, many orthographic systems also require the contribution of morphological awareness. The goal of this study was to examine the morphological and phonological awareness skills of preschool children as longitudinal predictors of reading and spelling ability by the end of first grade, controlling for the effects of receptive and expressive vocabulary skills. At Time 1 preschool children from kindergartens in the Greek regions of Attika, Crete, Macedonia, and Thessaly were assessed on tasks tapping receptive and expressive vocabulary, phonological awareness (syllable and phoneme), and morphological awareness (inflectional and derivational). Tasks were administered through an Android application for mobile devices (tablets) featuring automatic application of ceiling rules. At Time 2 one year later the same children attending first grade were assessed on measures of word and pseudoword reading, text reading fluency, text reading comprehension, and spelling. Complete data from 104 children are available. Hierarchical linear regression and commonality analyses were conducted for each outcome variable. Reading accuracy for both words and pseudowords was predicted not only by phonological awareness, as expected, but also by morphological awareness, suggesting that understanding the functional role of word parts supports the developing phonology-orthography mappings. However, only phonological awareness predicted text reading fluency at this age. Longitudinal prediction of reading comprehension by both receptive vocabulary and morphological awareness was already evident at this age, as expected. Finally, spelling was predicted by preschool phonological awareness, as expected, as well as by morphological awareness, the contribution of which is expected to increase due to the spelling demands of Greek inflectional and derivational suffixes introduced at later grades.
